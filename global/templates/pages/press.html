  <h1>Speaking &amp; Writing</h1>

  <p>We&rsquo;re always keen to talk about Spacelog and the unique process behind it. Particularly if you&rsquo;re in or around the London area, and would like a member or two from the Spacelog team to speak at your event, please get in touch. We&rsquo;ve spoken about the project at <a href='http://oxford.geeknights.net/2011/feb-9th/'>Oxford Geek Nights</a> &amp; <a href='http://huffduffer.com/skillswap/38756'>Brighton Skillswap</a>, and written about it for <a href='http://24ways.org/2010/extreme-design'>24Ways</a>.</p>
