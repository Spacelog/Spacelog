[00:00:30:23]
CMP: What's that? I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

[00:00:30:25]

LMP: Yes.

[00:00:30:34]

LMP: Okay.

[00:00:35:51]
LMP: About with that white mark?

[00:00:35:52]

[00:00:45:02]
CMP: Yes, I noticed that. Before, it was maintaining less than that; it was abnormally low. I almost asked them about it during boost, and then I decided to heck with it. Damn, it'll be hard to see through these optics ... down a little bit. Okay, proceed to Menkent. There she goes - Menkent.

LMP: What?

[00:00:46:32]

[00:00:46:35]
LMP: I was going to mark on 37, and that's Nunki; 30 and 37?
_page : 10

[00:00:46:53]

[00:00:47:18]
CMP: ... you guys would appreciate doing this with old G&N men.

[00:00:47:24]

[00:00:47:40]
CMP: I got it, I got it; go ahead.

[00:00:47:41]
LMP: Let's see, what's tearing me up is we're going to ORB rate on this damn booster, and the rate is very evident.

[00:00:47:48]
CMP: Okay, Z torque is plus 0.152 instead of 150; I suppose that's close enough. Now then, you got those numbers written down, Buzz?

[00:00:48:01]
LMP: Copy.

[00:00:48:02]
CMP: Okay. Now I - I - If I remember right, I think you're just supposed to torque without further ado. We give them the time at which we torque. So, as soon as you got them written down, let me know and I'll proceed and you can mark the time.

[00:00:48:13]
LMP: I've got it.

[00:00:48:14]

[00:00:48:15]
LMP: 48:15.

[00:00:48:34]
LMP: Atria - -

[00:00:48:35]
CMP: - - is Atria. You might note that, Buzz, also. I think - -

[00:00:48:39]
LMP: 34?

[00:00:48:40]
CMP: Yes, I think that's the third star; it'll say somewhere in that checklist. Proceed to Atria. Alright, if IMU is realigned, realign the GDC.

[00:00:49:04]
LMP: 0.1 degree. Probably GDC's off a lot more than that.

[00:00:49:12]
CMP: Okay, and Atria is there in the sextant. Well, you know, it's not right in the middle of the sextant. Of course, I guess - I don't know what - Have you ever heard any rules on what constitutes a good third star check?

[00:00:49:32]
LMP: No, all you're really doing is seeing that you've got the right stars, it seems to me.

[00:00:49:36]
CMP: It's there, but it's not dab-smack in the middle of the sextant; it's off, I would guess - 0.02 or some crazy number like that. Alright, having done that, VERB 37, ENTER; ... ENTER, and I'm going OPTICS ZERO and MANUAL, and cranking up the floodlights down here.

[00:00:50:04]

LMP: Is that right?

[00:01:07:09]
CMP: Yes.

[00:01:07:18]
CMP: Have we got any daylight? I can't see outside at all.

[00:01:07:22]
CDR: Nothing yet, ...

[00:01:07:26]
LMP: How are you going to rig that up, Michael?
_page : 14

[00:01:07:29]
CMP: Well, Buzz, I'm going to hold it out that hatch window.

[00:01:07:30]
LMP: Handhold it?

[00:01:07:32]
CMP: Yes - yes, yes, handhold it; don't dick with that.

[00:01:07:38]
CDR: Buzz can hold it, and you're going to run the monitor; have you run ...?

[00:01:07:40]
CMP: Yes.

[00:01:08:09]
CDR: Mike, how about this thing?

[00:01:08:16]
CMP: REPRESS - let's see, it's supposed to be - 865.

[00:01:08:22]
LMP: Go ahead.

[00:01:08:23]
CMP: And it - it kind of varies - not 865, but it's - 830.

[00:01:08:33]
CDR: ...

[00:01:08:40]
CMP: Well, I don't know how - that ought to ...

[00:01:08:44]
CDR: I can turn - turn it on FILL for a minute, if you like. That's what we need to do, I think.

[00:01:08:51]
CMP: Maybe the ... this son of a bitch is working or not.

[00:01:09:06]

[00:01:09:10]
CMP: Yes. ...

[00:01:09:21]
LMP: Let's get into the Hasselblad ... get the right settings on it.

[00:01:09:26]
CMP: Okay.

[00:01:09:29]
LMP: Is Goldstone the only station that's going to get this?

[00:01:09:32]
CDR: Yes, that's all. That's the only one that's got a scanner converter. We've only got about 4 minutes, looks like.
_page : 15

[00:01:09:44]
LMP: That must be doing something.

[00:01:09:46]
CMP: Yes.

[00:01:09:47]

CMP: ...?

[00:01:09:54]
CDR: No, no, it's the one with the ...

[00:01:09:59]
LMP: Okay, it's - it's working somewhat; it's just the question of not enough light in here when I get it.

[00:01:10:06]
CDR: Yes.

[00:01:10:07]
LMP: ... It's, I think, working okay.

[00:01:10:10]
CDR: We ought to be coming out into the daylight here in a little bit. Get it all shaped up?

[00:01:10:22]
LMP: I think it's fine. Now the one thing I forget about this is this zoom.

[00:01:10:30]
CMP: Do we want to write on this what - what we're taking pictures of? 0.5 millimeter.

[00:01:10:46]
LMP: Who knows about zoom lenses? This lens goes from 12.5 millimeters to 75; I assume that's the same nomenclature as on a camera. Right, 75 is zoom - -

[00:01:10:58]
CDR: I would think so.

[00:01:10:59]
LMP: - - and 12.5 is wide angle. The only thing that confuses me is that it says for vehicle to vehicle - We want to be zoom on 12.5. I guess they just want to make sure you got the other vehicle in view. Probably ... telephoto.

[00:01:11:15]
CMP: Okay, well, then, I'll put the zoom on 12.5.

[00:01:11:18]
LMP: Okay. You didn't touch this lighting?
_page : 16

[00:01:11:21]
CMP: No, I didn't ... Minimum ...

[00:01:11:29]
LMP: I've got bright.

[00:01:11:32]
CMP: Focus, I'll put at infinity, and the f-stop for vehicle to vehicle is - -

[00:01:11:58]
CDR: Not much light in here.

[00:01:12:02]
CMP: - - f:2.8.

[00:01:12:04]
LMP: What?

[00:01:12:09]
CMP: Okay. I - I'll show what it looks like inside of the cabin.

[00:01:12:27]
LMP: Okay, this looks alright, I think.

[00:01:12:30]
CMP: Point that at Neil or point it at somebody who's in the light. Yes, we'll get it. ... You want to see the monitor?

[00:01:12:41]
LMP: ...

[00:01:12:43]
CMP: Yes. You want to see the monitor?

[00:01:12:49]
CDR: Is this all ready to go; I'm going to put it back over here. It's over here under your stuff. Now, it seems to me if Buzz wants his camera to drift up, so what I ought to do is probably - Hey, Buzz.

[00:01:13:02]
LMP: Yes.

[00:01:13:07]
CDR: Hey, it seemed to stick pretty well if you stood it up on the - with the lens kind of pointing out. There are two pieces of Velcro over there.

[00:01:13:14]
LMP: Okay.

[00:01:13:16]
CDR: There are two pieces on the back of them ...

[00:01:13:17]
LMP: You think so, huh?

[00:01:13:18]
CDR: Yes, over, just a little up toward the ...

[00:01:13:28]
LMP: Now, ... - It's rolling around, so I can start looking outside, upside down.
_page : 17

[00:01:13:53]
CDR: I don't know, I think we'd almost be better just by looking at the monitor, Buzz.

[00:01:13:59]
LMP: Yes, yes, but this way I think I'll know how to - know which way to move it.

[00:01:14:07]
CDR: Are you going the right way for those hoses? It looks to me like you ought to roll over the other way.

[00:01:14:25]
LMP: Hey, there's something. How's that window?

[00:01:14:37]
CDR: When you get around there, Buzz, I'll give you the briefing (laughter). You just slid out of your - -

[00:01:14:59]
LMP: Where do we have to go to get a tissue?

[00:01:15:02]

[00:01:15:10]
LMP: While I'm here, let me - -

[00:01:15:11]
CMP: What - what - do you want a tissue for?

[00:01:15:14]

[00:01:15:16]
LMP: ...

[00:01:15:17]
CDR: - - that's a good idea; good head.

[00:01:15:22]
LMP: Brilliant ...

[00:01:15:23]
CDR: I got your checklist, Mike; you want it back?

[00:01:15:27]
CMP: Yes, I'll take it back, Neil - Thank you, just put it here.

[00:01:15:37]
CMP: No, you got Buzz's checklist here. You gave me BUZZ'S.

[00:01:15:41]
CDR: Excuse me.
_page : 18

[00:01:15:44]
CMP: ... I'd rather have my own.

[00:01:15:47]
LMP: How does the checklist look to you, Neil? You happy with it?

[00:01:15:51]
CDR: Yes, it looks fine to me.

[00:01:15:53]
LMP: Good.

[00:01:15:56]
CMP: I'll take your word for it, but the SPS and ECS and the EPS are now on ...

[00:01:16:06]
LMP: ...

[00:01:16:07]
CMP: Yes, I'll do that. Are you ready for me to hand you your light test?

[00:01:16:16]
LMP: No, one-handed snap. ... I'm in the center now.

[00:01:16:28]
CMP: Okay, Buzz, the - -

[00:01:16:29]
LMP: Alright, I'll put yours on the left.

[00:01:16:32]
CMP: It doesn't matter, they're all good - far as I'm concerned, one's like another.

[00:01:16:37]
LMP: As a matter of fact, I'll put yours on the right.

[00:01:16:38]
CMP: Okay.

[00:01:16:40]
LMP: ...

[00:01:16:43]
CMP: This 16-millimeter camera, Buzz, with the 18-millimeter lens - you got it shoved all the way up toward the window. I think we can - on this bracket.

[00:01:16:52]
LMP: Yes.

[00:01:16:53]
CDR: Okay, that was correct. You - you were asking about that.

[00:01:16:58]
CMP: And you have 6 frames per second, and it's color; you got 15 minutes worth - 6 frames a second, f:8, infinity, 1/250th.

[00:01:17:20]
LMP: Okay. The only question is, how much do we want to indicate on that?
_page : 19

[00:01:17:31]
LMP: Outside of it - on the magazine?

[00:01:17:36]
CMP: Yes.

[00:01:17:41]
CDR: How does zero g feel? Your head feel funny, anybody, or anything like that?

[00:01:17:44]
CMP: No, I don't know, it just feels like we're going around upside down.

[00:01:17:46]
LMP: ... I don't know - even feel that.

[00:01:17:49]
CDR: I feel the horizon coming up.

[00:01:17:52]
CMP: Oh, yes.

[00:01:17:54]
CDR: Buzz, are you ready to - -

[00:01:17:55]
CMP: ... 90 degrees the wrong way - -

[00:01:17:58]
CDR: - - are you ready for this briefing? Buzz?

[00:01:18:00]
LMP: Yes, let me get this.

[00:01:18:01]
CDR: Oh! Okay.

[00:01:18:04]
CMP: Oh, yes, stand by for sunrise.

[00:01:18:09]
CDR: Say, we got the rookie with us; he hasn't seen so many of those.

[00:01:18:23]
CDR: (Laughter) Okay. 30 seconds.

[00:01:18:30]
CMP: Oh, no, there is a possibility.

[00:01:18:33]
CDR: We haven't got too many of them on this flight, so you might as well enjoy it while you can. Buzz, how are you doing?

[00:01:18:42]
LMP: Okay, go ahead and talk.

[00:01:18:44]
CDR: Okay, I'd like to show this to you while I'm talking. It works like a camera. It has the - The f-stop control is right here, and you set it on f:22 which, of course, lets in the smallest amount of light, and that's a safety precaution. Now, later you'll probably find that you want to go away from f:22. Okay? Under zoom - Your zoom control, can you see? The zoom is the middle one, and it's 12.5 millimeters on the middle one - See the 12.5 millimeters? That's the zoom.

_page : 20

[00:01:19:18]
LMP: Yes.

[00:01:19:19]
CDR: Focus is on infinity. You ought to just leave that on infinity; no doubt about that. Now, the zoom, they may want you to zoom in on the horizon a little bit, or the land or whatever. I'd start out with a wide angle at 12.5, and I'd start out with this on f:22 just for protection against getting too much light in. In all likelihood, you'll have to change that a little bit.

[00:01:19:46]
LMP: I think that - that's going to do it.

[00:01:19:55]
CDR: Yes, that looks good. I don't see how that can miss.

[00:01:19:57]
CMP: Jesus Christ, look at that horizon!

[00:01:19:59]
CDR: Isn't that something?

[00:01:20:00]
CMP: God damn, that's pretty; it's unreal.

[00:01:20:08]
CDR: Get a picture of that.

[00:01:20:10]
CMP: Ooh, sure, I will. I've lost a Hasselblad. ... Has anybody seen a Hasselblad floating by? It couldn't have gone very far - big son of a gun like that.

[00:01:20:40]
CDR: Now, what do we have - Is that all the -

[00:01:20:44]
CMP: You had the switch down - inside. ... automatic light control features.

[00:01:21:05]
CMP: Well, that pisses me off. Hasselblad gone. Find that mother before she or I ends the ... Everybody look for a floating Hasselblad. I see a pen floating loose down here, too. Is anybody missing a ballpoint pen?

[00:01:21:17]
LMP: Got mine. Is it ballpoint, or is it ...?

[00:01:21:23]
CMP: Yes, ballpoint. Here it is. I mean felt tip.
_page : 21

[00:01:21:45]
CMP: ... much embarrassed to say they've lost a Hasselblad. I seem to be prone to that.

[00:01:22:01]
CDR: And we're about 7 minutes away, so we got about 7 minutes of practice time.

[00:01:22:13]
CMP: I've looked - I've looked everywhere over here for that Hasselblad, and I just don't see it.

[00:01:22:21]
LMP: You can go to your ...

[00:01:22:24]
CDR: It's too late for sunrise, anyway.

[00:01:22:27]
CMP: I know, but I'm worried about - -

[00:01:22:28]
LMP: But you want to get it before TLI.

[00:01:22:30]
CMP: - - I know it. That's what I'm worried about.

[00:01:22:31]
LMP: Neil, could you look around over there?

[00:01:22:32]
CDR: Yes, I'll look.

[00:01:22:35]
CMP: I don't know if we want to go through any wild contortions looking for it - Do we have to throw some other switches?

[00:01:22:41]
LMP: No, the switches are all thrown.

[00:01:22:45]
CMP: ... under you.

[00:01:22:57]
CMP: Buzz, you don't see the Hasselblad anywhere down below?

[00:01:23:10]
CMP: Let me go on a little expedition here. Has somebody ...?

[00:01:23:18]
LMP: I've looked already.

[00:01:23:24]
CMP: Ah! Here it is.

[00:01:23:25]
CDR: Find it?

[00:01:23:26]
CMP: Yes.

[00:01:23:27]
CDR: Beautiful.

[00:01:23:28]
CMP: It was floating in the aft bulkhead.

[00:01:23:30]
CDR: On your side?

[00:01:23:34]
CMP: I got a way on it - of keeping it.

[00:01:24:17]
CMP: I got a little horizon. Man, look at that!

[00:01:24:21]
LMP: Looks like what you have to do to this, is not hold it against the window, because it's going to pick up - -

[00:01:24:27]

[00:01:24:33]
CMP: ...

CMP: I found a spot that really ... my window.

LMP: Yes, it looks like ... I got my - -

[00:01:24:51]
CMP: Trees and a forest down there; it looks like trees and a forest or something. Looks like snow and trees. Fantastic. I have no conception of where we're pointed or which way we're going or a crapping thing, but it's a beautiful low pressure cell out here.

[00:01:25:10]
LMP: Yes, go ahead and take a picture. Keep your ... down.

[00:01:25:15]
CMP: Beautiful low pressure.

[00:01:25:16]
LMP: Must be past Hawaii by now. 01:28 is AOS.

[00:01:25:22]
CDR: Buzz, how's it going there, the monitor giving you good service?

[00:01:25:25]
LMP: Not yet - flicking an awful lot.

[00:01:25:26]
CDR: Well, that's ... - It looks to me like you're home free. Just remember now, you're going to have to get that f-stop probably off 22, maybe not – focus stays on infinity and the zoom beats me. You can take your choice, you can zoom with that thing all the way in if you take it fairly slowly.

[00:01:25:44]
LMP: Sun is bright, isn't it? ... It's a pretty nice camera, to tell you the truth.
_page : 23

LMP: Well, if I take normal to the window, it's going to be ..., ...?

[00:01:26:26]

[00:01:27:29]
LMP: Now, do we need to do anything else to configure this for ... receiver?

[00:01:27:32]
CDR: No, far as I know it's all up to them.

[00:01:27:50]
LMP: Oh, shoot; they're going to - Let's see, they're going to have to send us up a TLI pad, TLI abort, and a P37 pad. They're all right here in this little book; don't forget to remind me of that.

[00:01:28:02]
CMP: Okay, that's good.

[00:01:28:14]
LMP: How do you think we can ...?

[00:01:28:17]

[00:01:28:48]

[00:01:56:45]
CDR: Yes.

[00:01:56:46]
CMP: Maybe we can change the weight, but that's TLI plus 90; we got plenty of time.

[00:01:56:56]
CDR: We don't want to do that.

[00:01:56:57]
LMP: No.

[00:01:56:58]
CMP: It's almost the same anyway.

[00:01:57:00]
CDR: It's about the same anyway, yes.

[00:01:57:06]
LMP: Okay. You ready for the - your EMS MODE, NORMAL?

[00:01:57:11]
CDR: NORMAL.

[00:01:57:12]
LMP: EMS FUNCTION to DELTA-V TEST.

[00:01:57:15]

[00:01:57:27]
CDR: Minus 19.9.

[00:01:57:29]
CMP: That's alright - minus 0.1 to - can you write that one down?

[00:01:57:34]
CDR: It's real close.

[00:01:57:37]
CMP: Yes.

[00:01:57:41]

[00:01:57:44]
LMP: Alright. EMS MODE, STANDBY.

[00:01:57:48]

[00:01:57:51]
LMP: And EMS FUNCTION, DELTA-V, set. Set DELTA-VC. You got the number?

[00:01:58:03]
CMP: Yes. 10 4256.

[00:01:58:10]
CDR: 4256? How about 4356?

[00:01:58:16]
LMP: That's right, 4356.

[00:01:58:25]
CDR: And how about ORDEAL? Does that go back, Buzz?

[00:01:58:28]
LMP: Yes.

[00:01:58:35]
CDR: I guess we got all of those -

[00:01:58:49]
CMP: Where did all those numbers come from?

[00:01:58:54]
CDR: Yes; much better.

[00:01:58:57]
CMP: They give us a new state vector?

[00:01:59:00]
CDR: Yes.

[00:01:59:02]
LMP: Yes, they did.

[00:01:59:03]
CDR: They did, yes.

[00:01:59:04]
CMP: No, that's VERB 66. ... apogee - perigee.

[00:01:59:25]
LMP: I'll just put a question mark here about - not show our ignorance.
_page : 28

[00:01:59:32]
CMP: Well, looks like we're picking up a little. That sound reasonable? 1166?

[00:01:59:40]

[00:01:59:41]
LMP: The S-IVB?

[00:01:59:45]
CMP: Yes, you add about 4 or 5 miles to your orbit - apogee - perigee.

[00:01:59:49]
CDR: Yes.

[00:01:59:51]
LMP: Yes, that's too much.

[00:01:59:54]

[00:02:00:00]
LMP: That thing ... now, that may not be now; that may be at TLI.

[00:02:00:18]
LMP: I don't have any reason not to believe it.

[00:02:00:21]
CDR: No.

[00:02:00:25]
CMP: If it isn't any good, we'll need another one anyway, huh? So, there isn't any point in saving the other one.

[00:02:00:32]
CDR: Okay.

[00:02:00:33]
CMP: VERB 66.

[00:02:00:39]
CDR: Okay. 10 435.6.

[00:02:00:52]
LMP: 10 435.6. Alright, go to EMS FUNCTION, DELTA-V.

[00:02:01:00]

[00:02:01:01]
LMP: GDC align is at - What's this "D"?

[00:02:01:12]
CDR: Huh?

[00:02:01:13]
CMP: That means ...

[00:02:01:15]
LMP: Oh.

[00:02:01:17]
LMP: S what?

[00:02:01:19]
CMP: VHF.

[00:02:01:20]
LMP: Okay. A SIMPLEX, it should be on.

[00:02:01:23]

[00:02:01:28]
LMP: Let's see, ORDEAL is - -

[00:02:01:29]
CMP: What happened to that card that was here?

[00:02:01:30]
LMP: I already fired it.

[00:02:01:32]
CDR: What was that?

[00:02:01:33]
CMP: Um hum.

[00:02:01:34]
CDR: Saturn boost? This was a boost card.

[00:02:01:38]
LMP: Okay.

[00:02:01:39]
CMP: You can't have that.

[00:02:01:42]
LMP: You don't want that one, do you?

[00:02:01:43]
CMP: No.

[00:02:01:44]
LMP: Trade it - for a good one.

[00:02:01:55]
CMP: How about some LM pointing angles?

[00:02:02:03]
LMP: Okay, let's do one more. We're going first opportunity, you think?

[00:02:02:22]
CMP: Burn time is 05 plus 47.

[00:02:02:24]
CDR: Yes.

[00:02:02:27]
CMP: And emergency shutdown, Neil, is plus 10 seconds; 10 minus 40 on the DELTA-VC, is that right?

[00:02:02:32]
LMP: Plus 6 seconds - plus 6.

[00:02:02:39]
CMP: And - no - no, I'm sure about that minus.

[00:02:02:43]
LMP: No, no, it's not; it's only ...

[00:02:02:45]

[00:02:03:04]
CMP: The roll?

[00:02:03:05]
CDR: Burn ...

[00:02:03:06]
CMP: They're in the damn flight plan; I don't think they're in the checklist.

[00:02:03:27]
LMP: Alright. You got ORDEAL set in some way?

[00:02:03:30]
CDR: ORDEAL is okay.

[00:02:03:33]
LMP: Well, do you want to get ahead on a few things?

[00:02:03:38]
CDR: Well, give me an example.

[00:02:03:44]
LMP: We don't need the sequence pyro arm yet, huh?

[00:02:03:47]
CDR: No. Don't want to do that until -

[00:02:03:52]
LMP: TRANS CONTROL POWER, ON?

[00:02:03:54]
CDR: It's ON.

[00:02:03:55]
LMP: ROT CONTROL POWER, NORMAL, two of them, AC/DC?

[00:02:03:58]

LMP: CB, DIRECT ULLAGE, two of them, CLOSED.

[00:02:04:38]
CDR: Better wait awhile on that.

[00:02:04:44]
LMP: Okay, how about cranking the event timer to 51:00, then?

[00:02:04:52]
CDR: What's burn time? Ignition time? 2 what?

[00:02:04:59]
CMP: 35, 30 minutes.

[00:02:05:03]
LMP: Well, that's going to be ...

[00:02:05:08]

[00:02:05:47]

CMP: DELTA-VI - going to be ...

[00:02:06:45]
CMP: Sure you got - you got your checklist here, haven't you? Yes.

[00:02:06:48]
LMP: Yes, they put all this TLI crap in my checklist; even though I took it out, they put it back in.

[00:02:06:52]
CMP: Well, Mattingly assured me that I was going to have a circular velocity versus altitude, you know, when they get me at 100 miles on the other side?

[00:02:07:02]
LMP: It's not in here, either, I looked.

[00:02:07:04]
CMP: Where would it be? It'd be right in here -

[00:02:07:06]
LMP: I finally gave it to ...

[00:02:07:16]
CMP: Hey, that's - you know what the numbers are, roughly.

[00:02:07:24]
CDR: 25 - 25 550 at a 100 miles - something like that, it changes, probably - -

CMP: Yes, but this was to be - What do you have on this side to give you that on the other side?
_page : 32

[00:02:07:49]
LMP: I'm running a little bit on the warm side; how are you guys ... along?

[00:02:07:53]
CDR: Probably a tad on the warm side.

[00:02:07:59]
LMP: Suit and cabin pressures both look - I guess we should be cool.

[00:02:08:06]
CDR: Should be about 100 ... - okay -

[00:02:08:10]
LMP: Water - boiling - ... potable ...

[00:02:08:18]

[00:02:08:24]
LMP: Oh - stop there?

[00:02:08:25]
CMP: Yes.

[00:02:08:26]
CDR: Coming into the terminator.

[00:02:08:46]
CMP: Gee, I'm really disappointed over those optics; that telescope is horrible. Maybe it'll get better with practice - or adaptation, or what have you.

[00:02:09:38]
CDR: Gee, I almost went to sleep then.

[00:02:09:40]
CMP: Me, too; I'm taking a little rest.

[00:02:09:48]
LMP: It's going to be a long day.

[00:02:10:03]
LMP: How'd the - is this the first part of the attitude comparison check or the second part?

[00:02:10:10]
CDR: I haven't done the second GDC align yet; it comes up on the next page. About now, I guess.

[00:02:10:25]
CMP: Well, we should have Tananarive. How about going - pressing ahead with the sequence pyro arm?

[00:02:10:31]
CDR: Okay, let me align the GDC.

[00:02:10:46]
CDR: Well, they cleverly do this on - just on opposite sides of the world so you always have to pitch - run all the thumbwheels the maximum amount.

[00:02:11:56]

[00:02:12:05]

[00:02:13:15]
CDR: Alright.

[00:02:13:17]
CMP: Maybe you can start figuring out what the hell that ought to be.

CDR: Well, weren't they giving us two abort pads before?

[00:02:16:33]

LMP: Huh?

[00:02:18:40]
CMP: I wonder if I was that slow getting everything going? I ought to have given them a second or ...

[00:02:18:56]
LMP: It didn't seem to me as though there was a tremendous cue; there's no doubt that you were moving, but to say exactly what the precise time was when you started to move, I think you'd call it whenever the thing started vibrating.

[00:02:19:12]

Okay, Neil, now TLI - I'm going to write on the wall here - TLI - nominal is 05 plus 47; and 6 seconds later, it's 05 plus 53.

[00:02:45:50]
CMP: Don't look out window 1. If you're - if it looks like what I see out window 5, you don't want to look at it (laughter).

[00:02:45:55]

[00:02:46:03]

[00:02:46:10]
LMP: Yes, yes. Damn, everything's - just kind of sparks flying out there.

[00:02:46:18]
CMP: That's PU shift?

[00:02:46:19]
CDR: I don't know, but it sure put a little blip in there at 2 minutes; I think it increased in thrust.

[00:02:46:24]
CMP: Think it's the PU shift?

[00:02:46:26]
CC: Apollo 11, this is Houston. Thrust is good; everything's still looking good.

[00:02:46:32]
CMP: That's about like a pitch change rather than an acceleration increase. Did it feel that way to you?

[00:02:46:38]
CDR: Okay. We got a lighted horizon at 2-1/2 minutes. Pretty horizon.

[00:02:46:48]
LMP: A fairly smooth ride, you know; it's just a little tiny bit rattly, but nothing like Stafford's – H-dot looks great. Don't bet you could do any better.

[03:04:05:26]
LMP: Yes, but when you look down, you say it's brownish color?

[03:04:05:29]
CMP: Sure.

[03:04:05:32]
LMP: Oh, golly, let me have that camera back. There's a huge, magnificent crater over here. I wish we had the other lens on, but God, that's a big beauty. You want to look at that guy, Neil?

[03:04:06:40]
CDR: Boy, look at that ... crater. You can probably see him right there.

[03:04:06:44]
CMP: Yes, that's what I was talking about just a minute ago. It's kind of hard to believe that that's volcanic and formed by some faulting, isn't it? I don't believe that - but it's such a perfect straight line.

[03:04:07:05]
CMP: Hope none of those meteors come by right now.

[03:04:07:18]
CMP: Let me look through the sextant, Neil.

[03:04:07:41]

[03:04:10:01]
CMP: Yes, there's a moose down here you just wouldn't believe. There's the biggest one yet. God, it's huge! It is enormous! It's so big I can't even get it in the window. You want to look at that? That's the biggest one you ever seen in your life. Neil? God, look at this central mountain peak.

CDR: That's kind of a foggy window.

[03:04:10:37]

[03:04:10:51]

[03:04:10:53]
CMP: That's not how I'd like to spend my lifetime, but - picture that. Beautiful!

[03:04:11:01]
LMP: Yes, there's a big mother over here, too.

[03:04:11:07]
CMP: Come on now, Buzz, don't refer to them as big mothers; give them some scientific name.

[03:04:11:17]
LMP: It sure looks like a lot of them have slumped down.

[03:04:11:20]
CMP: A slumping big mother. Well, you see those every once in a while.

[03:04:11:26]
LMP: Most of them are slumping. The bigger they are, the more they slump - that's a truism, isn't it?

[03:04:11:41]
LMP: That is, the older they get.

[03:04:11:50]

LMP: We got 4 minutes to get down.

[03:04:12:13]
CMP: Alright.

[03:04:12:14]
LMP: Never make it. There's a couple of new craters.

[03:04:12:29]
LMP: Look warm down there, Neil?

[03:04:12:32]

[03:04:13:29]
CMP: Oh, I guess - get 10 pictures of the moon.

[03:04:13:36]
LMP: What did you want, Mike?

[03:04:13:39]
CMP: A gimbal angle to pitch to - if it's pitchdown 70 - why, let's see, from 226, that's 70, that's 296?

[03:04:13:54]
LMP: Yes, you were at 2 -

LMP: Are you going to maintain ORB rate?

[03:08:18:17]

CDR: People that live in there probably never get out.

[03:08:20:54]
CMP: Yes, I think you're right. Boy, you can really see the slumping, though. Most of the - You can see where it's all gathered down in the bottom in the corner; you know, on the edge - where a lot of the white stuff has dribbled on down – and evidently it gets covered over after a while with a - a darker layer. There's always a certain amount of the white stuff right in the edges. Pretty characteristic of all of these – white conical ones.

[03:08:21:50]
CMP: Yes, you know, you can change the color of what you're looking at by moving your head to a different spot in the window - and looking in a different direction.

[03:08:22:59]
CDR: Okay.

[03:08:23:18]
LMP: Man, I sure hate to say it based on looking through this monocular, but there's a white spot that's just like a crater - looks like an awful lot under these small fresh ones in the bottom of this rather old crater, but right in the center of it, it looks like instead of there being a crater, looks like it's a rock. ... My eyes deceiving me.

LMP: Son of a gun, that one's got a little – little curve on it.

[03:08:25:23]
CMP: Would you believe that, Neil? One went out and curved around like that. Can you explain that?

[03:08:34:49]
CDR: Did it just come up?

[03:08:34:50]
CMP: Yes.

[03:08:34:53]
LMP: We need that ...

[03:08:34:56]

[03:08:35:06]
LMP: Minus 67 and zero.

[03:08:35:09]
CMP: And zero.

[03:08:35:10]
LMP: Okay, MANUAL - and - AUTO - medium. There we go. Can't make up his mind between zero and - 360. Okay, we got them.

[03:09:41:22]
CC: Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We've played back the LOI 2 burn. It looks really good to us. The systems were all good. We got an orbit on the limited amount of tracking at 65.4 by a 53.9. Over.

[03:09:41:39]
CDR: Sounds good, Houston.

[03:09:41:41]

[03:09:41:46]

[03:09:45:31]
CDR: Yes.

[03:09:45:32]
CMP: The 16-millimeter bag as well?

[03:09:45:33]
CDR: Yes, I'll take that one, too.

[03:09:45:36]
LMP: Okay.

[03:09:45:59]

[03:09:47:34]
CMP: Man, can't you stop some of that racket up there?

[03:09:47:38]
LMP: Huh?

[03:09:47:52]

LMP: There's one that's got mission rules in it – but I can't place - at the moment, put my hands on it. ...

[03:09:50:10]
LMP: It's a NO-GO - GO/NO-GO - the one one I'm looking for. Hey, that's beautiful.

[03:09:50:28]
CDR: Like this?

[03:09:50:31]
LMP: Yes.

[03:09:50:33]
CDR: That's the one we made the changes in, right?

[03:09:50:37]
LMP: Right.

[03:09:50:40]
CDR: It may be up in the - in the command module, huh? Have you got another clip?

[03:09:50:49]
LMP: For the window?

[03:09:50:51]
CDR: I thought we might just stick my – activation checklist right - right there, and we'll be all ready coming in.

[03:09:50:56]
LMP: Right here?

[03:09:50:57]
CDR: Yes. ...

[03:09:51:02]
LMP: We may be ending up with one more than we're authorized - one, two, three, four, five. Yes, one of these will be changed over to - As a matter of fact, I stole one from Mike - but one of them we'll change over to the - -

[03:09:51:18]

[03:09:51:25]
LMP: This other one got changed.

[03:09:51:28]
CDR: No, it didn't.

[03:09:51:31]
LMP: You want to do that?

[03:09:51:32]
CDR: Yes, I can do that.

[03:09:51:50]
LMP: And in the meantime - Let's see, where'd the film go?

[03:09:52:19]
LMP: Now, the thing that would be nice to find out is if - how well - go - the 80-millimeter - with the film pack on it - in color.

[03:09:53:20]
LMP: You do put these in with this dark slide in, don't you? Is that right?

[03:09:53:24]
CDR: Which one you got? 60? 60 you do, and the 80 you - ...

[03:09:53:40]
LMP: ...

[03:09:53:42]
CDR: Yes, dark slide in.

[03:09:53:55]
CDR: It'll lock it the other way. That - that side - it'll pull it closed.

[03:09:53:59]
LMP: Alright. ... for telling me.

[03:09:54:10]
LMP: Boy, that thing goes all over, doesn't it? Maybe we ought to - do these the other way around.

[03:09:55:33]
LMP: Neil, we got two magazines, two color, A ... - one of them is R and the other is S.

[03:09:55:42]
CDR: Yes.

[03:09:55:43]
LMP: I'm going to put the R in the reserve camera.

[03:09:55:46]
CDR: Okay.

[03:09:55:47]
LMP: And the S in the surface camera.

[03:09:55:48]
CDR: Good idea.
_page : 107

[03:09:55:49]
LMP: Even though we're going to use them the other way.

[03:09:56:33]
CDR: Do you want to try it out in there?

[03:09:56:36]
LMP: I guess we could open the window here, just as well.

[03:09:56:59]
LMP: The window's all - frosted over.

[03:09:57:04]
CDR: Is it?

[03:09:57:06]
LMP: Well, I hate to stick my finger on it; I'm not sure which side it's on.

[03:09:57:09]
CDR: We'll have to - have to turn the heaters on tomorrow.

[03:09:57:16]
LMP: No, I think when the sun gets on them, it'll - ... them. Yes, the one on your side is ...

[03:09:58:08]
CDR: The black and white is magazine 2.

[03:10:02:05]
LMP: I don't guess there's any need to tape that up now.

[03:10:02:18]
LMP: We're on the back side now, right?

[03:10:02:20]
CDR: Yes, just come into - we're just coming into sunlight.

[03:10:02:22]
LMP: And we don't get the - contrast ...

[03:10:02:31]
CDR: What's the mission time, Mike?

[03:10:02:35]
CMP: Just a second. About 82 hours even.

[03:10:02:39]
CDR / CMP: ...

[03:10:02:40]
CMP: 82:02.

[03:10:02:42]
LMP: Okay, when do you get your tracking?

[03:10:02:44]
CMP: In a little while.

[03:10:02:47]
LMP: About what time?

[03:10:02:52]
CMP: About another half hour.

[03:10:02:56]
LMP: Before 83 hours?
_page : 108

[03:10:03:06]
CDR: Wasn't like this yesterday - must be because the sun was on it.

[03:10:03:24]
LMP: Boy, look at that big mother coming up there. Looks like we're heading for - ... over the horizon.

[03:10:04:22]
LMP: I don't think there's any place except in the – in here, that it says anything about 16-millimeter footage -

[03:10:04:33]
CDR: In the card, right?

[03:10:04:35]
LMP: No, I'm thinking about for the descent. Here we are; 16 millimeter, HC-EX, f:4, 500, infinity, 6 frames per second. Okay.

[03:10:05:14]
CDR: You got the flight plan handy, Mike?

[03:10:05:16]
CMP: Yes, I have; just a second.

[03:10:05:19]
CDR: I don't want it up here; I just want you to - when you get a chance, to read off the items that are on there, make sure we got them.

[03:10:05:26]
CMP: It says perform housekeeping chores, stow helmets, stowage bags; unstow mirror, checklist, and disposal assembly. Stow interim stowage assembly, unstow and configure for use 16 millimeter, HC-EX, f:4, 500, infinity, 6 frames per second. That's all it says - on that page. That's where we are now. The next thing is an hour from now when we transfer to LM power and activate the COMM.

[03:10:06:04]
LMP: 12 feet per second - half an hour.

[03:10:06:15]
CMP: Did you say something about taking pictures right now?

[03:10:06:18]
CDR: No, no; stop the camera.

[03:10:06:21]
CMP: Yes, I know, I don't think it'd take a very good picture right now.

[03:10:06:29]
LMP: One thing, when you get way up here, you can - see a lot more of that secondary strut.

[03:10:06:39]
CMP: No, that thing - that's holding up those damn baffles.
_page : 109

[03:10:06:51]
LMP: Well, if we could get a towel, we could get us a couple of fair-to-middling pictures out of here.

[03:10:06:59]
CDR: Alright. You want one?

[03:10:07:01]
LMP: Yes. Maybe - Some of it will come off, anyway.

[03:10:09:05]
LMP: Hand me a towel when you get a chance.

[03:10:09:14]
CDR: ... left window ...

[03:10:09:49]
CDR: This one's getting pretty well cleared off over here on the left.

[03:10:10:03]
LMP: You want the COAS in the forward window for undocking, huh? And you don't want the filter attached? I stuck it up here.

[03:10:11:03]
LMP: All that'll do is warm it up.

[03:10:11:42]
LMP: When do we have AOS?

[03:10:11:50]
CDR: Well, we - we should have AOS in - oh - 16 - 18 - in about another 20 minutes.

[03:10:12:44]
LMP: Alright, then, I think - the way we're sitting, why, we're going to be able to get a picture – of the earth coming right up there. What do you think about that?

[03:10:14:07]
CMP: Unique feature - photography (laughter). ... on the top of it.

[03:10:14:34]
LMP: What have you been using, 5.6 at 1/250th?

[03:10:14:52]
CMP: Yes. ...

[03:10:15:10]
LMP: What do you know, it works!

[03:10:15:18]
CDR: I could sure get the stop watch, huh?

[03:10:15:22]
LMP: Yes, you have the exact time to AOS - because I don't have my watch - set up for that.

[03:10:15:29]
CDR: ...

[03:10:15:30]
LMP: ...
_page : 110

[03:10:15:32]
CMP: I'm just fooling around; what do you need - AOS time? AOS is going to be - well, let's see - 82:30 - about 15 minutes from now.

[03:10:15:50]
LMP: Okay. I'll get another good picture of what comes along. Well, hell, I guess we might as well load the other camera and make sure it works, too, huh?

[03:10:16:00]
CDR: Adjust the - chronometer and put the cables in it, huh?

[03:10:16:05]
LMP: Yes.

[03:10:16:06]
CMP: Well, look, if we load this one - if I put the film on this one, and take a picture or two, well, I'll have to take it back off again; that's the only trouble. I won't have to, but it doesn't stow as neatly. If you don't mind doing - powered descent with the camera in there, I think that's probably alright. Well, wait a minute, I bet I could put this one loaded where the other one goes -

[03:10:16:47]
CDR: Where have you hid the shaving cream, Mike?

[03:10:18:12]
CDR: No wonder - ...

[03:10:18:20]
CMP: Uh, ...

[03:10:18:25]
CDR: ... that's the reason - -

[03:10:18:26]
CMP: No, I don't think you know; I don't think you know; I don't see how you know.

[03:10:18:30]
LMP: Hey, Neil, you see any need for keeping this thing?

[03:10:18:33]
CDR: What's that?

[03:10:18:34]
LMP: In the LM, this cover for the camera. Think about that for a while - I got it loaded, and I don't see any need to ever change it. If it works now - I guess if it quits before we actually went EVA, why there might be some reason to. 5.6 at 250th, huh?

[03:10:20:01]
LMP: Now, a few pictures of that and one of earthrise and - and then we'll stow it.
_page : 111

[03:10:21:45]
LMP: Well, I can't do anything until we transfer to LM power.

[03:10:22:10]
CDR: Do you know where the shaving cream is?

[03:10:22:13]
CMP: Shaving cream?

[03:10:22:17]
CDR: Yes.

[03:10:22:18]
CMP: Yes, I sure do; it's - -

[03:10:22:19]
LMP: In the penlight.

[03:10:22:21]
CMP: - - in the penlight compartment, huh?

[03:10:22:53]
LMP: How about this thing; you see any need to – to keep that in the LM?

[03:10:23:07]
LMP: Neil, what did you do with the - ... camera back sight?

[03:10:23:12]
CDR: I haven't had it.

[03:10:23:13]
LMP: Okay. What do you think about that?

[03:10:23:16]
CDR: I can't think of any reason why we might use it.

[03:10:23:18]
LMP: Well, there's a COAS - dust cover that I think fits in the same category, don't you? The thing that you got to move out to put the COAS in?

[03:10:24:05]
CMP: He's shaving.

[03:10:24:36]
CMP: I'm through with the flight plan, Neil, if you want it.

[03:10:24:41]
CDR: ...

[03:10:24:56]
CDR: ... razor?

[03:10:24:58]
CMP: The razor should be in there with the shaving cream, isn't it?

[03:10:25:01]
CDR: No - -

[03:10:25:02]
CMP: It wasn't?

[03:10:25:03]
CDR: - - ... shaving cream.
_page : 112

[03:10:25:04]
CMP: The razor wasn't in there?

[03:10:25:06]
CDR: The razor's in here, and I think the shaving cream was when I pulled it out, but - -

[03:10:25:11]
LMP: How much time to AOS, Mike?

[03:10:25:15]
CMP: 82:30 - about 5 minutes.

[03:10:28:42]
LMP: Don't know what I'm doing with VHF B on.

[03:10:28:52]
LMP: Hey, Mike?

[03:10:28:53]
CMP: Yes.

[03:10:28:57]
LMP: You got VHF B available?

[03:10:28:59]
CMP: What? Say again?

[03:10:29:05]
LMP: I don't know. According to this lousy thing, I'm powering up VHF B - T/R.

[03:10:29:11]
CMP: Not right now, not for another half hour or so.

[03:10:29:13]
LMP: No, I know, but - Are you going to have your VHF on?

[03:10:29:21]
CMP: If I'm going to record your data, I am.

[03:10:29:30]
LMP: Well, it doesn't say doodly squat about recording data.

[03:10:30:30]
LMP: ... coming up now.

[03:10:31:54]
CDR: Did you get them?

[03:10:31:56]
LMP: No, sure didn't.

[03:10:32:05]
CDR: Yes.

[03:10:32:07]
LMP: But I can't see ... - I see the earth, but it's a lousy picture.

[03:10:32:27]
CMP: Could you wait just 1? I'm right in the middle of the event-timer setting.

[03:10:32:41]
CMP: Okay, Houston. We'll be doing P22 in just a couple of minutes here.
_page : 113

[03:10:32:46]
LMP: You want to come in, Neil? Going in?

[03:10:33:59]
LMP: Want back up?

[03:10:34:00]
CDR: No.

[03:10:34:01]
LMP: Here's your shaving cream.

[03:10:34:03]
CMP: My only problem is I'm going to come over here and grab a switch and arm this hand controller.

[03:10:34:07]
CDR: Alright. I'll be out of your way.

[03:10:34:08]
CMP: Okeydoke. I'll tell you what you could do, if you're not doing anything else, is - supposed to take five marks 30 seconds apart. When I take the first one, you can take a hack and see - -

[03:10:34:26]
CDR: Okay.

[03:10:34:27]
CMP: - - whether I'm spaced properly or not, you know what I mean?

[03:10:34:28]
CDR: Yes.

[03:10:34:29]
CMP: Coach me along on when to take mark number 2, mark number 3, 4, 5.

[03:10:34:51]
CMP: And could you give me a hack on the MDC mission timer? It's going up to 35 minutes. Ready -

[03:10:35:00]
CMP: MARK it.

[03:10:35:05]
CDR: 35 minutes.

[03:10:35:06]
CMP: Okay, that's good. That program alarm is normal; it will reach that when the trunnion gets down below 50 degrees.

[03:10:35:21]
CDR: Okay.

[03:10:35:23]
CMP: All I'm doing is waiting for - the time; everything else is done.

[03:10:35:46]
CDR: You holding inertial, Mike?

[03:10:35:47]
CMP: Yes.

[03:10:37:04]

[03:10:37:08]

CMP: Old A-1. Old A-1.

[03:10:37:20]

[03:10:37:23]
LMP: I got the earth down by the strut.

[03:10:37:56]
LMP: The problem with this window is, Neil, I think it's too cold in here.

[03:10:37:59]
CMP: Neil, I'm going to get up here and get pitch - MANUAL ATTITUDE PITCH to ACCEL COMMAND. Those hand controllers are armed, so beware.

[03:10:38:02]
CDR: Okay.

[03:10:41:25]

[03:10:46:27]

[03:10:46:35]
CMP: Toward gimbal lock?

[03:10:46:37]
CDR: It's only gone 10 degrees towards gimbal lock.

[03:10:46:40]
CMP: Well, that's a pretty good error. I don't know why in the hell it does that.

CMP: Houston, Apollo 11.

CMP: Roger. Are you copying NOUN 129 on your downlink? If you've had enough time, I'll proceed.

[03:10:47:35]

[03:10:47:40]
CDR: Oh, must have been around - 210.
_page : 117

[03:10:47:50]
CMP: Just like the simulator.

[03:10:48:00]
CMP: Okay, now, the flight plan says where we want to stop ..., that says so right here - pitch 229 is where we want to stop.

[03:10:48:07]
CDR: Okay, we've gone by that, however, quite a ways.

[03:10:48:10]
CMP: I'm sorry, let's stop, then.

[03:10:48:12]
LMP: Is that local vertical?

[03:10:48:26]

[03:10:51:36]
CDR: Yes.

[03:10:51:55]
CMP: Okay, we didn't waste any gas by doing what we did, but what we wasted gas by was that goddamn DAP activity; I don't understand that. just like the simulator.

[03:10:52:09]
CDR: Sure enough.

[03:10:52:13]
CMP: You got a good view there, Neil?

[03:10:52:15]
CDR: Yes, I sure do.

[03:10:52:18]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 11.

[03:10:52:25]
CMP: All that procedure for P22 seemed to work very well. The only thing that was a little odd is that there was some DAP thruster activity. I had pitch in ACCEL COMMAND, and roll and yaw in RATE COMMAND, and somehow roll and yaw got excited, and DAP went into a flurry of thruster firing. We've noticed the same thing in the CMS and had just written it off as a CMS peculiarity.

[03:10:53:02]
CMP: Okay.

[03:10:53:34]
CMP: Well, one P22 out of the way. Ho, ho, ho!

[03:10:53:40]

[03:10:54:01]
CDR: - - TPI approach. Man, this is really something; you ought to look at this. You want to watch our approach into the landing site; you got to watch right through this window. We're coming over - we just passed Mount Marilyn. We're coming up on Maskelyne series here - straight out ahead, coming into the landing area.

[03:10:54:21]
CMP: Houston, we're holding inertial a little while to study the approach to the landing zone.

[03:10:55:06]

[03:11:06:17]
LMP: Yes, well, that's when you're talking at the same time.

[03:11:06:20]

[03:11:13:26]

CMP: Houston, Columbia. Reading you loud and clear.

[03:11:43:24]
CMP: Armstrong says it's the hatch and - if we leave the probe and drogue there, we'll save us some time tomorrow; I don't know if it's tolerable sleeping or not. I think what previous crews have been doing is reinstalling all that claptrap up in there.

[03:11:43:40]

[03:11:47:12]
LMP: Well, COMM's good. Son of a bitch might work.

[03:11:47:58]
LMP: - - sleeping?

[03:11:47:59]
CMP: I'll be glad to sleep over there, alright? I don't think it'll affect that; I'd rather sleep, I'd rather sleep with the probe and drogue than have to dick with it in the morning.

[03:11:48:06]

[03:11:50:37]
LMP: How about the systems stuff - to put the machine to bed.

[03:11:51:01]
CMP: You go to REACQ and NARROW?

[03:11:51:02]
CDR: Yes.

[03:11:51:05]
CMP: So I guess the COMM's pretty well taken care of?

[03:11:51:08]
CDR: Yes.

[03:11:51:09]
CMP: Have you got the waste water dump?

[03:11:51:10]
CDR: No, I haven't done that, but I will.

[03:11:51:12]
CMP: Let's see, I imagine we want to go out of VOICE? Or not?

[03:11:51:17]
CDR: Very, very - -
_page : 128

[03:11:51:18]
LMP: The whole bit they said.

[03:11:51:24]
CMP: Okay.

[03:11:51:57]
CMP: Lunar orbit asleep; (cough) S-BAND SQUELCH, ENABLE?

[03:11:51:58]
LMP: I did it.

[03:11:51:59]
CMP: Got that, huh?

[03:11:52:00]
LMP: Yes.

[03:11:52:01]
CMP: HIGH GAIN, REACQ, NARROW; antenna pitch angle - -

[03:11:52:06]
LMP: Yes, I did that.

[03:11:52:07]
CMP: - - that's all it says.

[03:11:52:08]
LMP: Okay.

[03:11:52:10]
CMP: Plus the normal configuration.

[03:11:52:13]
LMP: Doesn't it say anything about DOWN VOICE BACKUP - or any of that stuff?

[03:11:52:16]
CMP: (Cough)

[03:11:52:31]
CMP: No.

[03:11:52:33]
LMP: Okay.

[03:11:52:37]
CDR: Waste water dump, we'll wait until 84 hours; they may have the vent modeled or some crazy thing like that, so I want to be at the right time.

[03:11:52:45]
LMP: Alright.

[03:11:52:47]
CMP: Well, let's see, normal lunar configuration. Well, it is DOWN VOICE BACKUP.

[03:11:52:52]
LMP: Yes.

[03:11:52:54]
CMP: Well, let's get going here. PRIMARY, PRIMARY, HIGH, VOICE, (cough) PCM, RANGE, DOWN VOICE BACKUP, AUX TAPE, OFF; TELEMETRY to DATA; and UP TIM COMMAND to NORMAL; VHF A and B, OFF; RECEIVE only, ...; PCM/ANALOG, RECORD, FORWARD, NORMAL, NORMAL - that's okay, LOW - PRIMARY, REACQ, and NARROW. Well, COMM's set.

_page : 129

[03:11:53:56]
LMP: Good.

[03:11:53:57]
CDR: I got to vacuum up some water and dump the waste water tank, and we're about set.

[03:11:54:05]
CMP: Hey, I got a fuel cell - O2 - -

[03:11:54:09]
CDR: Hey, our water's about all gone.

[03:11:54:10]
CMP: Did they say anything about the O2 purge?

[03:11:54:13]
CDR: Must have gone into the LM.

[03:11:54:14]
CMP: Yes, I think it did; it went on the windows. They didn't say anything about it, huh?

[03:11:54:17]
LMP: No.

[03:11:54:18]
CMP: Well, I guess we'll do it then. Anybody get my - Well, heck, I guess we're really not through with them yet, are we?

[03:11:54:36]
CDR: I updated the LOS time in your -

[03:11:54:39]
CMP: Yes. I think I'll wait until we get them back again before doing the purge. Okay? Because, I don't know, maybe they want all that stuff done on the back side.

[03:11:55:11]
LMP: Well, I propose to give myself a little bit of a - a bath, but not to put that damn LCG on tonight. You never did ask them about the - about the ..., huh? I sure haven't found them.

[03:11:55:40]
CMP: I think we ought to do that.

[03:11:56:00]
CMP: Neil, you still got that tissue dispenser, the empty one?

[03:11:56:06]
CMP: Thank you.

[03:11:56:27]
LMP: What's baseline altitude? ... the altitude - descent altitude settings?
_page : 130

[03:11:57:01]
LMP: That's the - that's the last meal we eat before descent, huh?

[03:11:57:12]
LMP: Sure is.

[03:11:57:26]
CMP: Wowee!

[03:11:57:27]
LMP: 95 - that's - 7 - got 10 hours. Whew!

[03:11:57:44]
LMP: Might whip out that piece of bread in there.

[03:11:58:43]
LMP: Through in the tunnel, Mike?

[03:11:58:46]
CMP: Through, yes.

[03:11:58:47]
LMP: Okay, I want to get the lights out then.

[03:11:58:48]
CMP: Okay, ...

[03:11:59:29]
LMP: What are your dosimeters reading?

[03:11:59:38]
CMP: ... up a little bit.

[03:11:59:41]
CDR: Mine says - 11012.

[03:11:59:50]
CMP: I can't read this little fart. Says 10013.

[03:12:00:03]
LMP: I think they all started out at even thousands. They had them each different so they could tell which was which.

[03:12:01:13]
LMP: Well, I don't know about you, but I think I'll raid the pantry for some bite-size stuff.

[03:12:01:24]
LMP: I don't know when we'll get a chance to use it  maybe some time - -

[03:12:01:26]
CMP: Monoculars?

[03:12:01:30]
LMP: - - during the maneuvers.

[03:12:01:32]
CMP: Found it, huh?

[03:12:01:34]
CDR: We're going to take that into the LM.

[03:12:01:36]

[03:12:02:25]
SC: (Laughter)

[03:12:02:27]
LMP: Oh, that is weird - that crazy moon out there again, huh? Funny-looking thing.

[03:12:03:12]
CMP: Buzz, this crazy bracket goes right here. It's probably right the hell in your way, isn't it?

[03:12:03:17]
LMP: No, no.

[03:12:03:18]
CMP: Not in your way?

[03:12:03:19]
LMP: No, I can survive with that.

[03:12:03:21]
CMP: Alright, let me put it up there; it'll be one less thing to do in the morning. It's in backwards, but I don't think -

[03:12:03:33]
CMP: Well, if I don't need this thing anymore, I think It'll stow that one away. Systems are yours tomorrow?

[03:12:03:44]
CDR: Yes.

[03:12:03:45]
CMP: I don't know as we've got much to do; there's a purge.

[03:12:03:50]
CDR: Is it 84 hours yet? Yes, it is; I'm going to dump the waste water.

[03:12:04:36]
CMP: You dumping?

[03:12:04:37]
CDR: Yes.

[03:12:04:42]
LMP: (Cough) Boy, it's a dusty vehicle in here. Man! But that view approaching the landing site is just fantastic right out - right smack out the window, you know that?
_page : 132

[03:12:04:52]
CDR: Yes.

[03:12:04:53]

CMP: 1 or 2 degrees, Neil?

[03:12:05:02]
LMP: - - that I really couldn't - -

[03:12:05:04]
CDR: I think ... - -

[03:12:05:05]
LMP: - - I could identify the Cat's Paw and I could identify the pair of craters right at the end, but I couldn't really make out the backward V nor the three little curved ones on one side - -

[03:12:05:17]
CMP: I didn't see the backwards either.

[03:12:05:18]
LMP: - - but I could see the area where it all was, you know, and - -

[03:12:05:19]
CMP: Yes, yes.

[03:12:05:21]
LMP: - - it didn't go any farther back that this, and it didn't really go any farther forward than that - it really didn't. You know, it was rougher than a cob (laughter).

[03:12:05:27]
CMP: Rougher than a cob, but I didn't see ...

[03:12:05:31]
LMP: Well, when you compare it with the surrounding areas, why it's - it's pretty reasonable.

[03:12:07:21]
CDR: You want this somewhere?

[03:12:07:23]
CMP: ...

[03:12:07:42]
CDR: If you don't mind, I'll put it on this big piece of Velcro over here by the fuel cell.

[03:12:07:52]
CMP: Yes, that's a good place for it.

[03:12:09:46]
LMP: Anybody for a barf bag?

[03:12:11:08]
LMP: Can you think of any use for a slide rule in the LM, Neil?
_page : 133

[03:12:11:19]
LMP: Huh?

[03:12:11:27]
CDR: I can't think of any use for two of them.

[03:12:11:31]
LMP: Okay.

[03:12:15:24]
LMP: That COMM was so good I don't think I'd need those damn things ...

[03:12:16:29]
CMP: Anybody say anything about terminating battery current?

[03:12:16:33]
LMP: No.

[03:12:16:45]
CMP: You remember anything about that, Neil?

[03:12:16:48]
CDR: No.

[03:12:18:12]
CMP: Somebody's blue towels? Did I dislodge those by mistake or did you have those?

[03:12:18:18]
CDR: No, don't believe I had them.

[03:12:18:20]
LMP: I had them out, kind of floating around back here.

[03:12:18:38]
LMP: Everything I think you could dislodge, they forgot to put Velcro on the damn thing.

[03:12:19:31]
CMP: Could you - maybe reach back and - hand me that wrench right quick?

[03:12:19:40]
CDR: Yes, I sure could. Sure could ...

[03:12:19:54]
CMP: You want me to swap one?

[03:12:20:00]
CDR: No, I think I'll keep one for tonight.

[03:12:20:03]
CMP: Okay.

[03:12:20:26]

[03:12:20:27]

[03:12:22:34]
CMP: Well, I just want to make sure I'm through with the roll; I think I am.

[03:12:22:42]
CDR: Can't figure out how you tell when one's gone. I think that was it.

[03:12:22:50]
CMP: Oh, it stopped!

[03:12:23:49]
LMP: It's a bear to get in and out of here.

[03:12:23:54]
CDR: Think maybe it'd be easier if you ... them right here.

[03:13:12:01]
CMP: I have a bit of fruitcake left over from somewhere; if anybody wants some, here it is. ...

CDR: Couldn't have done better myself.

[03:13:39:47]
CMP: It may be raunchy later.

[03:13:39:56]
LMP: It may be? There's no doubt about it!

[03:13:40:02]
CDR: Oh, I'll take a couple small ones.

[03:13:40:05]

CDR: Everybody through with the water?

[03:13:43:00]
LMP: Yes, go ahead.

[03:13:44:08]
LMP: Ever find your box?

[03:13:44:11]
CMP: No. Gosh, you remember when they told us about - about putting buttons on the seat of these pants?

[03:13:44:27]
CDR: No, I don't remember.

[03:13:44:33]
LMP: Yes, they were working out - this elaborate scheme.

[03:13:44:38]
CMP: Yes, ... had a choice between ... and Velcro.

[03:13:44:52]
CDR: What's its use? I mean, don't keep me hanging in suspense.

[03:13:44:55]
CMP: Well, whatever I tell them, they didn't give me.

[03:13:44:57]
CDR: Shouldn't have anything.

[03:13:44:59]
LMP: Nothing in it.

[03:13:45:01]
CDR: Good grief, man!

[03:13:45:02]
CMP: They tell me you got to use Velcro on there. Maybe on the other side.

[03:13:45:08]

[03:13:45:12]

CMP: How'd you sleep last night, Buzz, up on top?

[03:13:51:59]
LMP: You open up the outer one, and you put the inner one in there and squeeze it and it breaks, then you got to take the ... and insert it and mush it all up - to get that stuff evenly distributed through it.

[03:13:52:25]
LMP: Why don't you guys sleep underneath tonight? I'll sleep top deck.

[03:13:52:34]

[03:13:52:36]
LMP: Yes, that's right; I remember ...

[03:13:52:40]
CMP: Unless you'd rather sleep up top, Buzz; I like - you guys ought to get a good night's sleep, going in that damn LM - How about - which would you prefer? Is that probe and drogue going to be in your way over there?

[03:13:52:51]

CDR: You got a crater coming up, Buzz? Right through here. I don't know if you can see it or not. If not, let me get a picture of it because it's really - got big ... on the bottom of it. It don't look good.

[03:14:16:05]
LMP: Seashells.

[03:14:16:06]
CDR: Yes.

[03:14:16:07]

We just appeared to get a solid lock for the last - oh, about a minute, the TUNE FOR MAX needles have been wandering up and down and the pitch and yaw needles have been wandering around, but it appears to have reacquired by itself solidly now. We're just filling - finishing up our fuel cell purge. Hydrogen on number 3 is the last to go off, and it'll be coming off in just a second.

LMP: The red one comes out this far, and the green one's out further than that. The whole thing is only about that long. It's got to be in one or the other or you can't see it.

[03:23:39:16]

[03:23:39:17]

LMP: Houston, Eagle. Go ahead.

[04:02:23:19]

[04:02:26:34]
CMP: Houston, Columbia's in OMNI C, Charlie, DOWN VOICE BACKUP and, when you get a chance, could you look up the coordinates of 130 for me, please? I have conflicting information between my cue card and my flight plan. I'd like to know which coordinates you want me to use.

[04:02:27:04]
LMP: Houston, Eagle. Completed gear extension okay.

[04:02:27:54]

[04:02:31:29]
CMP: Roger. Thank you.

[04:02:33:11]
LMP: Roger. We're just sitting around waiting for something to do. We need a state vector, a REFSMMAT before we can proceed on with the AGS, and we need you to watch our DAP data load, gimbal drive check, and throttle test. Over.

_page : 152

[04:02:33:54]
LMP: Roger. We'll go ahead with the DAP and the throttle check since we don't have a gimbal drive test, okay?

[04:02:35:31]
CMP: Houston, Columbia. Those T1 and T2 times are still good, aren't they?

[04:02:35:40]

CMP: Thank you.

[04:02:37:56]
LMP: Houston, Eagle.

[04:02:38:03]
LMP: Roger. In accordance with the - page 47, step 1, we had the guidance control in PGNS and MODE CONTROL, PGNS, AUTO; and, of course, the circuit breakers are not in on the thrusters yet, so when we started through the DAP and proceeded on NOUN 46 - and we're looking at NOUN 47 now - why, we got an RCS TCA light, and we've got four out of the eight other bright-colored red flags. I think that this is explained by the fact that we are in - PGNS and AUTO and just unable to fire the thrusters. Over.

[04:02:39:21]
LMP: Roger.

[04:02:40:00]
CDR: Houston, Eagle. Are you going to need the high gain before you can look at our GDA position indicators?

[04:02:40:35]

[04:02:49:52]

LMP: Mike, are you in AGS CAL attitude now?

[04:03:34:54]
CMP: That's affirm. I'm holding you there with the DAP, getting the deadband. When you get ready to do the AGS CAL, I will sort of quiet down the thruster firing and then hope to stop it altogether, but I don't even think that'll get it.

[04:03:35:09]
LMP: Okay. Well, I'm just about ready to do that. Whenever you're ready to let it go free, why just tell me.

[04:03:36:00]
CMP: Buzz, you copy?

[04:03:36:10]
CMP: Buzz, you copy?

[04:03:36:13]
LMP: Okay, Mike. Thanks.

[04:03:36:17]
CMP: Now, ... might check me on this, I - it's - I'm ready to go anytime you're ready.

[04:03:36:24]
LMP: Roger. We'll be ready to go in just a minute.

[04:03:37:46]
LMP: Okay, I'm starting my 5-minute rate - right now.

[04:03:40:00]
CMP: As a matter of interest, I appear to be drifting in my roll; I'm holding my pitch and yaw pretty constant, and I'm staying a good 15 degrees late in the program.

[04:03:40:15]
LMP: Roger.

[04:03:40:17]
CMP: Looks like a ...

[04:03:40:31]
CMP: Halfway through it, it looks like I have ... degrees in roll is about all.

[04:03:40:39]
LMP: Yes, those look like good ones right now.

[04:03:41:22]
LMP: Mike, what's your SEP time?

[04:03:41:26]
CMP: A few minutes.

[04:03:41:49]
CMP: GET of the separation burn is 100:39:50 even.

[04:03:42:01]
CMP: I haven't gotten the updates for undocking time; I'm still carrying 100 hours 15 minutes, I guess, ...

[04:03:42:23]
CMP: I'm surprised they didn't update it by 3 or 4 minutes to, you know, make that DELTA-V be in the same position that they wanted.

[04:03:42:33]
LMP: Yes, I agree.
_page : 156

[04:03:42:38]
CMP: So we're about 3 minutes ahead of the printed flight plan; it might be wise to try to SEP about 3 minutes early, and we can give them a GET of SEP that's precise whenever they want it.

[04:03:43:06]
CMP: I have 5 minutes and 15 seconds since we started. Attitude is holding very well.

[04:03:43:21]
LMP: Roger, Mike. Just hold it a little bit longer.

[04:03:43:25]
CMP: No sweat, I can hold it all day. Take your sweet time. How's the Czar over there? He's so quiet.

[04:03:43:45]
CDR: Just hanging on - and punching.

[04:03:43:49]
CMP: I didn't know ... radio. ... I've ever seen a radio. All I can say is, "Beware the revolution."

[04:03:46:21]
CMP: You cats take it easy on the lunar surface; if I hear you huffing and puffing, I'm going to start bitching at you.

[04:03:46:28]
LMP: Okay, Mike.

[04:03:46:37]
CDR: I just pressurized the DPS. ... looks okay, Mike.

[04:03:46:40]
CMP: Roger that.

[04:03:49:19]
LMP: Hey, Mike, can you see where our radar's pointing now?

[04:03:49:29]
CMP: Well, it looks like it's pointed right at my head; that's hard south; so's your radio beacon.

[04:03:49:34]
LMP: Okay. It should really - it should be pointing from the - you know, our forward axis? It should be pointing up at 40 degrees and, you know -

[04:03:49:48]
CMP: Okay. We've wandered back over the bellyband now - let me assure that AGS CAL.

[04:03:49:54]
LMP: ...

[04:03:50:19]
CMP: How'd the AGS CAL work out?

[04:03:50:23]
LMP: Oh, it danced around a little bit, but seemed to go right back to the original numbers.
_page : 157

[04:03:50:33]
CMP: Okay. I'm going to start a maneuver now to our undocking attitude.

[04:03:51:21]
CMP: Now the undock attitude and the SEP attitude ought to be the same, so I'm going to go to what they gave me for the updated separation-burn attitude. That's just about 7 degrees off, but it's in your flight plan for the undock attitude.

[04:03:51:38]
LMP: Okay.

[04:03:53:12]
CMP: When your rendezvous radar self-test is complete, let me know and I'll check out my transponder.

[04:03:53:30]
LMP: Excuse me, Mike, what did you say?

[04:03:53:33]
CMP: I say, when your rendezvous radar self-test is complete, let me know and I'll check out my transponder.

[04:03:53:38]
LMP: Yes, we're through with that now.

[04:03:53:41]
CMP: Thank you. I'm maneuvering the ...

[04:03:58:44]
CMP: That transponder checked out. I hope they've got a nice, big, strong ... for you.

[04:03:58:49]
LMP: Very good.

[04:03:59:56]
LMP: Hey, Mike, what would you recommend as a good setting on the 16 millimeter?

[04:04:00:02]
CMP: Well, what they recommend for you is f:8 at 1/250th and put it not on infinity, but on 7 feet, which covers all the way from infinity down to a very short distance to keep it in focus, and 6 frames per second, I guess.

[04:04:00:25]
LMP: Yes, what you say, f:8 at 1/250th?

[04:04:00:28]
CMP: Yes, f:8 at 1/250th. And after you get it all set up, check that f-stop again because it slides and slips off with very little twist.

[04:04:03:53]
CMP: How about using, as an undocking time, 100 hours and 12 minutes? That suit your fancy?
_page : 158

[04:04:03:59]
CDR: That'll be fine.

[04:04:04:05]
CMP: Okay.

[04:04:04:11]
CDR: What have you got for AOS, Mike?

[04:04:04:14]
CMP: I have 100 hours and 16 minutes.

[04:04:04:20]
CDR: Okay.

[04:04:10:44]
CMP: We got just about a minute to go; you guys all set?

[04:04:10:48]
CDR: Yes, I think we're about ready.

[04:04:11:47]
CDR: We're all set when you are, Mike.

[04:04:11:51]
CMP: 15 seconds.

[04:04:12:03]
CMP: Okay, there you go. Beautiful!

[04:04:12:06]
CDR: ...

[04:04:12:10]
LMP: Looks like a good SEP.

[04:04:12:19]
CMP: Looks good to me.

[04:04:12:59]
CDR: Okay. I've killed my rate, Mike, so you drift out to the distance you like and then stop your rate.

[04:04:13:13]
CDR: Starting my yaw.

[04:04:13:30]
CDR: There's sure a better visual in the simulator.

[04:04:13:38]
CMP: Okay. I picked up a little roll; I'm going to get rid of it.

[04:04:14:22]
CDR: Okay with you if I start my pitch, or you think you're not far enough away yet, Mike?

[04:04:14:31]
CMP: I'd prefer you stand by just a couple of seconds, Neil.

[04:04:14:34]
CDR: Okay. I'll wait for when you're ready – when you think you've got your rates killed perfectly.
_page : 159

[04:04:14:39]
CMP: Okay. I'm still holding ...

[04:04:14:41]
CDR: ...

[04:04:15:26]
CMP: Okay, looks pretty good to me now.

[04:04:15:30]
CDR: Okay.

[04:04:16:34]
CMP: Just like in the simulator, you're drifting off to one side and down below a little bit.

[04:04:16:39]
CDR: Yes.

[04:04:17:06]
CMP: The gear are looking good; I've seen three of them.

[04:04:17:11]
CDR: The MESA is not down, right?

[04:04:17:14]
CMP: Say again.

[04:04:17:15]
CDR: The MESA's still up?

[04:04:17:19]
CMP: Yes,

[04:04:17:20]
CDR: Good.

[04:04:17:49]
CMP: Now, you're looking good.

[04:04:17:59]
LMP: Roger. Eagle's undocked. The Eagle has wings. Looking good.

[04:04:18:18]
CMP: Okay. You've got it, P00 and DATA.

[04:04:18:39]
CDR: You check our tracking light, Mike?

[04:04:18:44]
CMP: It came on.

[04:04:18:56]
CMP: Camera's working beautifully.

[04:04:19:00]
CDR: Track off?

[04:04:19:04]
CMP: It's off.

[04:04:19:05]
CDR: I'm ready to start my yaw maneuver if it suits you, Mike.
_page : 160

[04:04:20:04]
CDR: Does it look like you're going to be able to do this without firing any thrusters, Mike?

[04:04:20:11]
CMP: I'd have to fire laterally once or twice.

[04:04:20:22]
CMP: Very small.

[04:04:20:26]
LMP: Go ahead, Houston. Eagle is ready to copy.

[04:04:21:49]
LMP: Go ahead.

[04:04:21:59]
LMP: That's affirmative. Go ahead with the PDI.

[04:04:24:46]
LMP: Roger. Back to BLOCK and DOI: 101:36:14.07; minus 0075.8, plus all zeros, plus 0009.8; 0057.2, plus 0008.5, 0076.4, 0:3O; 000, 293; minus 0075.9, plus all zeros, plus 0009.0; NA. Over.

[04:04:29:00]
CMP: Neil, I'm maneuvering in roll.

[04:04:29:03]
CDR: Roger. I see.

[04:04:29:08]
LMP: Houston, Eagle. Are you copying the fairly large numbers for range and range rate in - VERB 83? And did you - you just give us a state vector that changed one of the two vehicles? Over.

[04:04:29:38]
LMP: Okay. That explains the difference.

[04:04:31:03]
CDR: You want him to go to HIGH GAIN, YAW, zero or - say again the numbers.

[04:04:31:17]
CDR: Okay. YAW, zero; PITCH, minus 20, on the HIGH GAIN. Columbia.

[04:04:31:24]
CMP: Yes, I copy that, and I'll do it just as soon as I get to it.
_page : 161

[04:04:31:27]
CDR: Okay, he says he'll do that as soon as he gets around there.

[04:04:31:38]
CMP: Okay, Neil, I'm all set for the SEP burn, and we're looking good on this phasing.

[04:04:31:42]
CDR: Okay.

[04:04:32:38]
CMP: Columbia, read you loud and clear. Houston, how me?

[04:05:26:54]
LMP: Burn time, 30 seconds.

[04:05:28:44]
LMP: Okay, state vector looks relatively good. ...

[04:05:29:01]
CDR: Mike, how do you read?

[04:05:29:10]
LMP: Columbia, Eagle. How do you read?

[04:05:29:12]
CMP: Very good. How do you read me?

[04:05:29:13]
LMP: Very good. If you are ready, give the mark and we'll go to B DATA. Over.

[04:05:29:19]
CMP: Stand by 1. I'm ...

[04:05:29:22]
LMP: Are you ...?

[04:05:37:47]
CDR: Mike, the burn's complete; it was on time - residuals are nulled, and AGS's free.

[04:05:43:08]
LMP: Roger. Let's go now to VHF RANGING.

[04:05:43:11]
CMP: Over and out.

[04:05:43:20]
CMP: Okay.

[04:05:43:24]
LMP: And you got VERB 76 in?

[04:05:43:27]

[04:05:43:47]

[04:05:44:23]
LMP: Can't beat that. Okay, through with that?

[04:05:45:52]
LMP: Right.

[04:05:45:54]
CDR: Okay. I'm going to start pitching down to 125.

[04:05:46:15]
LMP: No PDI plus 12.

[04:05:46:34]
CMP: I have you right down ... 65 feet per second.

[04:05:46:38]
CDR: Sounds good.

[04:05:47:03]
LMP: Okay, the camera is set. And ought to be ready to do the P52.

[04:05:47:13]
CDR: Yes.

[04:05:47:15]
LMP: Not going to be much of a drift check.

[04:05:47:23]
CDR: It - it torques them late enough to ensure that - ... the drift check.

[04:05:47:32]
LMP: Sure seems like we're going the wrong way.

[04:05:47:42]
LMP: How much do we got to go to pick it up?

[04:05:47:46]
CDR: Got to go - oh, half the moon to go, I guess.

[04:05:48:05]
CDR: Coming down already.

LMP: Now we can let us take - let it take us there.

[04:05:49:03]
CDR: No, wait; don't do that.

[04:05:49:05]
LMP: Why not?

[04:05:49:06]

[04:05:57:33]
CDR: Hmm.

[04:05:57:40]
CDR: How are you doing - you going to be about ready to mark?

[04:05:57:46]
LMP: Yes.

LMP: Say, how about you remembering the number that I read to you; don't have to write it down. Roll right just a little.

[04:05:58:08]

[04:05:58:10]

[04:05:58:12]

[04:06:01:47]
CDR: Okay. We'll ...

[04:06:02:11]
CDR: Cottonpicker just won't stay - try it!

[04:06:02:16]
LMP: Well, wait until we lose that descent stage, man.

[04:06:02:19]
CDR: We'd better take - a - piece of tape; hold that down.

[04:06:02:25]
LMP: How about if you get the bottom in the – get the bottom underneath this cover? That help?
_page : 168

[04:06:02:34]
CDR: Well, it - it's still not; I've had it in there real good couple of times.

[04:06:02:42]
LMP: Your - hoses were tearing hell out of my board.

[04:06:02:47]
CDR: Sorry.

[04:06:02:50]
LMP: You got INVERTER 1 circuit breaker in, right?

[04:06:02:53]
CDR: Checked in.

[04:06:02:54]
LMP: Okay. I'm going to check INVERTER 1. INVERTER 2 is good; and INVERTER 1 is good, and we're on INVERTER.

[04:06:03:05]
CDR: ... look good.

[04:06:03:16]
LMP: Okay, get your AELD circuit breaker in and ABORT STAGE circuit breaker in.

[04:06:03:19]
CDR: AELD is in; ABORT STAGE is in.

[04:06:03:24]
LMP: Cycle the CWEA? No, we must have lost one.

[04:06:03:28]
CDR: Yes. That cottonpicker may be trouble.

[04:06:03:35]
LMP: Well, we'll have to tell them about that. I don't know when it - when it went out, because we didn't get any light that I saw, did you?

[04:06:03:45]
CDR: I think it's just a switch. I ... if it doesn't trigger a light -

[04:06:03:50]
LMP: Something - -

[04:06:03:51]
CDR: Oh, we're in PULSE, and we're not commanding any firing - -

[04:06:03:55]
LMP: I don't know; that could have come under DOI, but I doubt it.

[04:06:04:02]
CDR: I just think that's one of those sticky flags. ... got a good engine.

[04:06:04:11]
LMP: Alright, let's see.

[04:06:04:12]
CDR: ...
_page : 169

[04:06:04:18]
LMP: ENGINE STOP button was reset?

[04:06:04:24]
CDR: ENGINE STOP button is START, but it is going to be now.

[04:06:04:31]
LMP: Alright. Window bars; THROTTLE CONTROL to AUTO.

[04:06:04:39]
CDR: Okay. THROTTLE CONTROL to AUTO.

[04:06:04:42]
LMP: Alright, TTCA - -

[04:06:04:44]
CDR: THROTTLE on MINIMUM.

[04:06:04:45]
LMP: - - ENABLE - ENABLE - THROTTLE in MINIMUM. Okay, in 35 minutes, we'll get the BAT feeds ON and - -

[04:06:04:56]
CDR: That's the wrong time, right?

[04:06:04:57]
LMP: No, no, no.

[04:06:04:59]
CDR: ...? PDI?

[04:06:05:00]
LMP: It's - oh - about - probably maybe a second, right here, ... 32. Okay?

[04:06:05:09]
CDR: Yes, it's about a second off.

[04:06:05:13]
LMP: If it's fast, I'll stop it; if it isn't, why, forget it.

[04:06:05:50]
LMP: You want this one over there?

[04:06:05:51]
CDR: I need this out. Burn in 46 minutes.

[04:06:05:57]
LMP: You want this one?

[04:06:06:00]
CDR: Yes. I don't - think - it'll be helpful, but I'll stick it here and pull it out if I need it.

[04:06:06:20]
LMP: Let's see; we haven't got P20 going yet, have we?

[04:06:06:23]
CDR: No.

[04:06:06:24]
LMP: Let's do that. Let's get the RENDEZVOUS RADAR circuit breaker in.
_page : 170

[04:06:06:27]
CDR: Okay.

[04:06:06:34]
LMP: IN. Might look at the DPS.

[04:06:06:51]
CDR: What do you hear?

[04:06:07:00]
LMP: ... glycol pumps.

[04:06:07:03]
CDR: Alright.

[04:06:07:10]
CDR: Look at that. Oh, that must have been - ...

[04:06:07:20]
LMP: Okay, ascent - tank pressure - temperature's up, changed to - I don't know.

[04:06:07:28]
CDR: DPS's good -

[04:06:07:30]
LMP: Look at all that RCS we got.

[04:06:07:35]
CDR: That's more than we've ever had in the simulator, isn't it?

[04:06:07:38]
LMP: Yes.

[04:06:07:51]
CDR: Got your camera rigged?

[04:06:07:54]
LMP: The other circuit breaker? Camera's all set to go. I hope the others just don't fall out. Got them both in?

[04:06:08:01]
CDR: Yes.

[04:06:08:17]
LMP: Well, let's hope he's in mode 2.

[04:06:08:33]
LMP: Okay, I'm going to get the ASCENT BATS, ON. BATTERY 5, ON; looks good. BATTERY 6, ON; that's good.

[04:06:09:08]
CDR: Yes, we've lost it.

[04:06:09:14]
LMP: Well, did it go to mode 2? That's where I want it to go.

[04:06:09:22]
CDR: No - I can't tell.

[04:06:09:26]
LMP: Yes, it's going to mode 2. Hasn't it?
_page : 171

[04:06:09:33]
CDR: Yes.

[04:06:09:34]
LMP: Yes. There we are. Beautiful.

[04:06:09:38]
CDR: Go to AUTO TRACK?

[04:06:09:39]
LMP: No, not yet - wait until the light goes out. Did that thing want to - Hey, I didn't know that could do that. You don't hear that, huh? (Laughter)

[04:06:10:01]
LMP: Hear that, too, huh?

[04:06:10:06]
CDR: Sounds like wind whipping around the trees.

[04:06:10:16]
LMP: Okay, AUTO TRACK.

[04:06:10:32]
LMP: Okay, we ready to go to P63?

[04:06:10:36]

[04:06:11:07]
LMP: Okay, get a - get a - Need to compare a TIG time. 09:50. That's right.

[04:06:11:25]
CDR: See that Big Dipper there?

[04:06:11:27]
LMP: That's a big out of plane, but I don't know which way it is.

[04:06:11:33]
CDR: I believe minus - but they were expecting it.

[04:06:11:36]
LMP: Okay, four -

[04:06:11:38]
CDR: That's within 7 ... seconds. Okay?

[04:06:11:53]
LMP: Okay. These should not be in AUTO, right?

[04:06:11:57]
CDR: Yes. Remember that one.

[04:06:12:13]
LMP: 180, 287, 0. Here goes.

[04:06:12:46]
CMP: Give me - -

[04:06:12:47]
CDR: You'll get them before we will.

[04:06:12:50]

[04:06:12:54]
LMP: Well, I hope it's on the right page.

[04:06:13:24]
LMP: Okay, I'm going to get DESCENT QUANTITY, ON, ... ON.

[04:06:14:19]
CDR: Okay, you want to give it - Okay, we've lost it. In AUTO now.

[04:06:14:42]
LMP: ... RANGE RATE.

[04:06:14:59]
CDR: How about that?

[04:06:30:47]
CDR: VERB 77 and a VERB 62.

[04:06:31:04]
LMP: Okay, sequence camera coming on.

[04:06:31:22]
CDR: Should be a little ...

[04:06:31:43]
LMP: Roger. I think I've got you on high gain now.

[04:06:31:47]
CDR: Okay. Hear anything about that?

[04:06:32:02]
CDR: Say again the angles, though.

[04:06:32:04]
LMP: I'll set them in to use them before we yaw around.

[04:06:32:15]
LMP: Copy.

[04:06:32:19]
CDR: Okay. What else is left to do here?

[04:06:32:22]
LMP: ENGINE ARM, DESCENT. 40 seconds.

[04:06:32:30]
CDR: Is your camera running?

[04:06:32:31]
LMP: Camera's running.

[04:06:32:42]
LMP: Okay, ...

[04:06:32:46]

[04:06:33:07]
CDR: IGNITION. 10 percent.

[04:06:33:14]
LMP: Just about on time.

[04:06:33:18]
CDR: You got the OVERRIDES ON?

[04:06:33:21]
LMP: OVERRIDE is ON. 24. FLASH. THROTTLE, up.

[04:06:33:34]
CDR: Good. Okay.

[04:06:33:42]
LMP: PGNS holding.

[04:06:33:59]
LMP: Okay, we're reading your relay to us, Mike? I'll leave it in SLEW. Relay it to us. See if they got me now; I got good signal strength on SLEW.

[04:06:34:21]
LMP: Okay, rate of descent looks good.

[04:06:34:27]
LMP: Roger. Copy.

[04:06:34:44]
LMP: Copy.

[04:06:34:49]
CDR: Okay. Coming up on 2 minutes; going good. AGS's good?

[04:06:34:57]
LMP: AGS and PGNS agree very closely.

[04:06:34:59]
CDR: RCS is good; no flag. DPS pressure is good. 1 minute.

[04:06:35:11]
LMP: 30 feet per second. Light's on. Altitude's a little high.

[04:06:35:21]

[04:06:35:32]
LMP: SLEW.

[04:06:35:43]
LMP: Houston, I'm getting a little fluctuation in the - AC voltage now. Just the meter, maybe, huh?

[04:06:36:03]
CDR: Okay, we went by the 3-minute point early. A little off.
_page : 174

[04:06:36:11]
LMP: Rate of descent looks real good. Altitude – right about on.

[04:06:36:16]
CDR: Our position checks downrange show us to be a little off. AGS - AGS is showing about 2-feet-per-second greater rate of descent.

[04:06:36:34]
CDR: MARK.

[04:06:36:35]
CDR: Show us to be about - Stand by. Maybe have to stop that.

[04:06:36:41]
LMP: Altitude rate looks right down the groove.

[04:06:36:44]
CDR: Roger. About 2 seconds off - rolling over.

[04:06:36:54]
CDR: Okay, now watch that signal strength because -

[04:06:36:58]
LMP: Yes, I think it's going to drop.

[04:06:37:01]
CDR: Boy, I tell you, this is much harder to do than it was -

[04:06:37:09]
LMP: Keep it going.

[04:06:37:16]
LMP: Houston, before we leave you, the ED BATS are GO at 4 minutes.

[04:06:37:28]
LMP: Roger.

[04:06:37:44]
CDR: How you look over there? Okay?

[04:06:38:02]
LMP: Okay. You got good lockon.

[04:06:38:05]
CDR: We got a lockon?

[04:06:38:06]
LMP: Yes. Altitude light's out.

[04:06:38:08]
CDR: Okay.

[04:06:38:12]
LMP: DELTA-H is minus 2900. We got the earth right out our front window.

[04:06:38:20]
CDR: Sure enough.
_page : 175

[04:06:38:22]
LMP: Houston, you're looking at our DELTA-H. Program alarm.

CDR: 1202; 1202.

[04:06:38:40]
CDR: What is it?

[04:06:38:42]
LMP: That's in core ...

[04:06:38:46]
CDR: Give us a reading on the 1202 program alarm.

[04:06:38:57]
LMP: Roger. 330. Okay, looks like about 820. Roger. Copy. 6 foot ...

[04:06:39:12]
LMP: Same alarm and it appears to come up when we have a 16 68 up.

[04:06:39:19]
CDR: Were we - were - was it coming down?

[04:06:39:22]
LMP: Yes, it's coming down beautifully.

[04:06:39:26]
CDR: Roger; it looks good now.

[04:06:39:32]
LMP: THROTTLE, DOWN.

[04:06:39:33]
CDR: THROTTLE, DOWN, on time.

[04:06:39:35]
LMP: You can feel it in here when the throttle's down; better than the simulator.

[04:06:39:46]
LMP: AGS and PGNS look real close.

[04:06:39:48]
CDR: Okay. No flags. RCS is GO; DPS is GO; pressure is - okay.

[04:06:40:11]
LMP: Okay, I'm still on SLEW, so we may tend to lose as we gradually pitch over; let me try AUTO again now, and see what happens. Okay, looks like it's holding.

[04:06:40:25]
CDR: Okay. 07:30 coming up. Should be ...

[04:06:40:36]
LMP: ...

CDR: Houston - Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.

[04:06:46:14]
CDR: Thank you.

[04:06:46:17]
CDR: Okay. Let's go on. Okay, we're going to be busy for a minute.

[04:06:46:23]
LMP: Alright, MASTER ARM, ON. Take care of the descent vent.

[04:06:46:25]
CDR: MASTER ARM coming OFF.

[04:06:46:27]
LMP: I'll get the pressure vent.

[04:06:46:28]
CDR: Okay.

[04:06:46:36]
LMP: Very smooth touchdown.

[04:06:46:49]
CDR: I didn't hear that vent going - -

[04:06:46:51]
LMP: ... oxidizer.
_page : 179

[04:06:46:55]
CDR: ... vent.

[04:06:48:12]
CMP: Houston, how do you reed Columbia on the high gain?

[04:08:32:56]
LMP: Okay, Houston. On DESCENT 1, the fuel and oxidizer are reading 10 psi; on DESCENT 2, fuel is reading 10 psi; oxidizer, 11 psi.

[04:08:34:02]
CDR: Okay, going back to OFF.

[04:08:34:40]
CDR: ... is OPEN. Yes, ...

[04:08:34:46]
LMP: Alright, we need the -

[04:08:34:52]
LMP: Houston, Tranquility Base is ready to go through the powerdown and terminate the simulated countdown.

[04:08:35:08]
CDR: Hope he is, too.

[04:08:35:10]
LMP: OPEN.

[04:08:35:13]
CDR: Okay, the operations HEATER circuit breaker is OPEN.

[04:08:35:21]
LMP: Roger. It's in progress. Anytime, take your helmet off.

[04:08:35:45]
LMP: Roger. Couldn't have had better treatment from all of you back there.

[04:08:40:55]
CMP: Houston, Columbia. Copy NOUN 49?

[04:08:41:02]
CMP: Roger.

[04:08:41:44]
CMP: Yes, stand by 1, Charlie, for the next ...

[04:08:41:56]
CMP: Well, the area looks smooth, but I was unable to see them. I just picked out a distinguishable crater nearby and marked on it.

[04:08:42:12]
CMP: It looks like a nice area, though.

[04:08:42:46]
CMP: Houston, Columbia. I say again: I did not see them. AUTO optics pointed at a spot very close to the coordinates which you gave me, so I picked out a tiny crater in that area and marked on it, so that I'll be able to have repeatable data, but I was still unable to see them.

_page : 180

[04:10:36:14]
CMP: Houston, Columbia. I'm coming up on my time for the first pass when I may be able to see the LM. Do you have any topographical cue that might help me out here on - AUTO optics is tracking between two craters. One of them, as the LM sees it, would be long at 11 o'clock; the other would be short and behind him at 5 o'clock. They're great big old craters - depressions.

[04:10:38:40]
CMP: Roger, Houston. Columbia ... up. I kept my eyes glued to the sextant that time, hoping I'd get a flash of reflected light off the LM, but I wasn't able to see any of my scan areas that you suggested.

[04:10:39:17]
CMP: It's going past now, Bruce, but I scanned that area that you are talking about very closely, and no, I did not see them.

[04:10:40:26]
CMP: Go ahead.

[04:10:40:57]
CMP: Stand by 1.

CMP: Roger; Columbia OMNI Charlie. How do you read?

[04:16:06:34]
CMP: Hallelujah.

[04:16:06:57]
CMP: Roger, understand. You want a option 1 - P52, option 1?

[04:16:09:09]

[04:16:18:07]
CMP: Negative, Bruce. Just give me your latitude - longitude over 2, altitude, and the grid squares. Never mind the other; you're broken up.

[04:16:18:28]
CMP: Well, that is, if you have the new information; otherwise, I'll just use the old numbers.

[04:16:18:37]
CMP: Okay.

[04:16:22:17]
CMP: Houston, Columbia. You got the new coordinates?

[04:16:22:31]

[04:16:23:13]
CMP: Roger. Thank you.

[04:16:23:43]
CMP: Okay.

[04:16:23:56]
CMP: Okay. I read back plus 00692, plus 11713, and minus 00144. And you have a grid square for me?

[04:16:24:36]
CMP: Kilo 0.9 and 6.3. Thank you. One of these grid squares is about as much as you can scan on a single pass.

CMP: Roger. ...

[04:16:34:43]
CMP: Roger. I need a very precise position because I can only do a decent Job of scanning maybe one of those grid squares at a time. The area that we've been sweeping covers 10's and 20's and 30's of them.

[04:16:35:10]

CDR: Looks good, Mike.

[05:07:59:35]
LMP: Okay, they're pulled.

[05:07:59:39]
CDR: Pull it out.

[05:07:59:40]
LMP: Okay. Circuit breakers - -

[05:09:04:08]
LMP: Now, here are a couple of bags - and I think it's self-explanatory what goes in them.

[05:09:04:14]
CDR: Yes.

[05:09:04:18]
LMP: ... water.

[05:09:04:41]
LMP: Now, where are those things?

[05:09:04:44]
CDR: They're at the over ...

[05:09:04:55]
LMP: Maybe I could slide out of here ...

[05:09:05:20]
LMP: Hey, Michael, you all tied up there?

[05:09:05:25]
CMP: ...

[05:09:05:27]
LMP: Get ready for those million-dollar boxes. Got a lot of weight; now, watch it.

[05:09:05:52]

[05:09:05:57]

LMP: Okay.

[05:09:06:32]
LMP: Use what?

[05:09:06:34]
CDR: Use lithium hydroxide.

[05:09:07:06]
CDR: That thing still doesn't fit. No, they didn't fix it.

[05:09:07:10]
LMP: Huh?

[05:09:07:11]
CDR: They didn't fix it. I had thought somebody had mentioned it, at least.

[05:09:07:19]
LMP: ...

[05:09:07:20]
CDR: What?

[05:09:07:21]
LMP: ...

[05:09:07:26]
LMP: Yes.

LMP: Well, that's ...

[05:09:09:22]
CDR: Oh, the tape, I guess.

[05:09:09:25]
LMP: Want tape?

CDR: Yes, please.

[05:09:09:27]
LMP: Here you are.

[05:09:10:56]
LMP: I hope I took the thing apart correctly.

LMP: Say, you did get a couple of hard ones in there, didn't you?

[05:09:11:46]
CDR: Yes.

[05:09:12:15]
LMP: I guess we leave this here or do you want to take it up?

[05:09:12:19]
CDR: I'd leave that here.

[05:09:12:22]
LMP: That might be a little hard to explain.

[05:09:14:03]
LMP: It's back yonder.

[05:09:14:05]
CDR: What?

[05:09:14:07]
LMP: It's behind the hatch.

[05:09:14:20]
CDR: Contingency sample.

[05:09:14:23]
CMP: Rock?

[05:09:14:25]
CDR: Yes, there's some rocks in it, too. You can feel them, but you can't see them; they're covered with that - graphite.

[05:09:14:39]
CMP: ... compared to -

[05:09:14:45]
CDR: Looks like powdered graphite to me.

CMP: Yes.

[05:09:14:50]
LMP: Yes?

[05:09:14:51]
CMP: Yes, I guess I have; just a second.

[05:09:14:53]
CDR: You know, that - that one's just a bunch of trash that we want to take back – LM parts, odds and ends, and it won't stay closed by itself; we'll have to figure something out for it.

[05:09:15:16]
LMP: Ouch! Alright, here's your checklist.

[05:09:16:36]
LMP: You vacuum all this stuff?

LMP: Gloves, lunar stuff?

[05:09:16:46]
CDR: ...
_page : 211

[05:09:17:05]
LMP: Okay. It looks to me like - what we're going to do is vacuum you out and get you out of here. I'll - throw the switches down there.

[05:09:17:16]
CDR: How about the data bag?

[05:09:17:18]
LMP: No, I need this bag.

[05:09:17:20]
CDR: Well, I've got one here. I'll go try to get some more - when I go over. Okay?

[05:09:17:26]
LMP: Okay. Give me the vacuum tube.

[05:09:17:38]
CDR: Let me get my back to you first.

[05:09:19:02]
LMP: Need a PPK.

[05:09:19:05]
CDR: Huh? I guess they're in here. PPK's?

[05:09:19:20]
LMP: I guess they're over here.

[05:09:19:51]
CDR: ..., you know? (Laughter)

[05:09:19:54]
LMP: Get your circuit breakers pushed, AUDIO control circuit breakers?

[05:09:20:06]
CMP: ...

[05:09:21:13]
CMP: How are you doing?

[05:09:21:16]
LMP: It's filthy.

[05:09:21:18]
CMP: Does all this stuff come in here?

[05:09:22:09]
CDR: Well, I guess that ought to do it.

[05:09:22:20]
LMP: Okay.

[05:09:26:13]
CDR: ...

[05:09:26:14]
LMP: Yes.

LMP: Say, I need some of those data books.

LMP: Where did you put the book? Where did you put the first one? In here? Okay.

[05:09:28:28]
CDR: ...

[05:09:28:33]
LMP: No, we can leave those two here. No, I don't want either of those two. No, I think the others might be -

[05:09:28:55]
CDR: ... we leave these bags here.

[05:09:28:59]
LMP: Okay.

[05:09:29:18]
LMP: Hey, have you been over it, Mike?

[05:09:29:21]
CMP: ... really ...

[05:09:29:31]
LMP: How about calling them and asking them for – if those angles are still good? Right at lock-lock with them?

[05:09:29:43]
CMP: ... last time ...

[05:09:29:47]
LMP: Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

[05:11:00:26]

[05:11:00:34]
LMP: It's not, but I'll get it off.

[05:11:00:36]
CDR: Okay.

[05:11:00:41]
CC: Roger. We were seeing - believe it or not, we were seeing some funnies on the Eagle's rendezvous radar - -

[05:11:00:48]
LMP: What do you do with it?

[05:11:00:49]
CC: - - and that was the only theory that we had - it looked like it was a good one.

[05:11:00:52]
LMP: Hey - what do you do with it?

[05:11:00:54]
CMP: Just turn it down to off.

[05:11:00:56]
LMP: This goes off - -

[05:11:00:57]
CMP: No, no, no, no, that's not the one - it's this switch right next to that IMU - -

[05:11:01:00]
LMP: Oh.

[05:11:01:01]
CMP: - - Buzz. Okay, that one, just turn it to – turn it to position 1 - extreme left; that one. There you go. Thank you.

[05:11:01:18]
LMP: I thought you were going to be doing VHF RANGING on the darn thing because we had it set up for - VHF ...

[05:11:01:24]
CMP: I don't know where ... other than that.

[05:11:01:31]
LMP: That was to - -

[05:11:01:35]
CMP: You ought to check the flight plan, it doesn't mention the (laughter) probe or the drogue. It says I remove my hatch, and then I notify you that you're clear to open your hatch.

[05:11:01:49]
CMP: Huh?

[05:11:01:58]
LMP: Oh, no.

[05:11:01:59]
CMP: So, that's just the contingency.

[05:11:02:04]
LMP: No, negative.

[05:11:02:06]
CMP: That's the contingency.

[05:11:02:08]
LMP: We move the drogue there. ...

[05:11:02:11]
CMP: We've got to reach down and grab that extension handle and all that good stuff.

[05:11:02:26]
LMP: That was alright, we understand.

[05:11:02:47]
CDR: Yes.

[05:11:03:09]

[05:11:03:38]
CMP: ...

[05:11:03:39]
CDR: How about during lift-off?

[05:11:03:41]
CMP: ...

[05:11:03:46]
CMP: How was lift-off? How did lift-off feel?

[05:11:03:48]
LMP: Well, there was a little - little blast – then we started moving; then we could see all those - -

[05:11:03:56]
CMP: ... were you very stable; I mean, you just sort of floated up or was there a bunch of rattling around?

[05:11:04:01]
LMP: - - The floor came up to meet you. I think it multiplied g by ... - it was about - at lift-off - maybe - half a g or two-thirds of a g.

[05:11:04:25]
CMP: Well, you know, - well, just looking at that one sample, it was - I'm surprised you didn't have a lot more dust. Now you saw dust during descent, I think, around 40 feet, something like that, 30 feet maybe.

[05:11:04:38]
LMP: Yes it was - -

[05:11:04:43]
CMP: But it's pattern is such that it sprays out horizontally, and it doesn't really come up and engulf you, huh?

[05:11:04:48]
LMP: All the stuff looks like very light tan and gray, you know, that's - that's the color of it. When you get right up there to it, when you see it, why that isn't the color at all.

[05:11:05:01]
CMP: Dark - battleship gray, isn't it?

[05:11:05:05]
LMP: Maybe not - I don't know - -

CMP: Well, what kind of - -

LMP: - - what stuck to the spacecraft, I think you can see afterwards - -

[05:11:05:12]
CMP: What do you think it is from the - geology standpoint, is it basalt dust?

[05:11:05:19]
CDR: ...

[05:11:05:21]
CMP: Well, do the rocks - do the rocks all look the same? They're different - good, great; I'm glad to hear it.

[05:11:05:28]
LMP: There's really a tremendous -

[05:11:05:42]

[05:11:06:08]
LMP: We were kind of rushed, if that's what you mean.

[05:11:06:25]

[05:11:07:07]

[05:11:08:05]
CDR: Yaw left 13 degrees.

[05:11:08:08]
CMP: Ah so, ah so.

[05:11:08:32]
CDR: I guess the main thing on this stowage is to make sure it's reasonable for the g's we'll get during TEI and sometime on the way home we can get everything all squared away for ...

[05:11:08:46]
CMP: No, I'm in no rush. Go ahead - go ahead and get everything all packed away; I hate to have – a couple of suits out. If you want to air it for a while, go ahead and get the hose to it, and - I'm in no rush. I'll take this thing off after you guys are done there.

[05:11:09:20]
CDR: ...

[05:11:09:30]
CMP: Yes. Is that right?

[05:11:09:44]

[05:11:09:50]
LMP: ...

[05:11:09:53]
CMP: Yes, yes.

LMP: - - ...

[05:11:10:41]
CMP: Well, did - when you look - when you're walking around or just looking out the window of the LM, did it appear very homogeneous? Everything sort of the same color and all, or did it look ...?

[05:11:10:56]
LMP: ...

[05:11:10:58]

LMP: When you looked down sun, it's very tan, very tan.

[05:11:11:03]

[05:11:12:14]

[05:11:12:20]
CMP: It's the lower valve on the lower panel – lower left; that guy right there. Yes, that guy right there; put him down to DUMP. Dump's easy, fine; set the clock.

[05:11:13:08]
CDR: ...

[05:11:13:10]

[05:11:15:10]

[05:11:16:14]
LMP: Okay.

[05:11:16:15]
CMP: Yes. Maybe it - maybe it would make more sense to put the couch up now. Why don't you let me wrestle with the couch before we do anything more to this damn poor L-shaped bag?

[05:11:42:05]
CMP: Yes, here it is.

[05:11:42:06]
CDR: Let me put it down here. Bring it on down. Over here. Put them all in one place.

[05:11:42:30]

[05:11:43:10]
CMP: Somehow we'll figure a way to ...

[05:11:45:22]
CDR: 2 feet per second.

[05:11:45:46]
LMP: You didn't maintain that 3-1/2 feet per second down there.

[05:11:45:51]
CDR: (Laughing)

[05:11:45:56]
LMP: Well, I hope - I hope they have the data that shows just what we did have at contact when they can get photographs ... all the film we got.

[05:11:46:14]
CDR: Yes.

[05:11:46:19]
LMP: Well, I really couldn't put the ... no place, not that I'm sure of it, but my light came on, why, ... hit.

[05:11:47:18]
CDR: Yes, that's sure - the way that thing was working - the way that thing was working and stayed locked on all the way down - Gees, it was a beautiful thing.

[05:11:47:44]
CDR: You mean you didn't ...?

[05:11:47:53]
LMP: Getting all the damn alarms.

[05:11:48:06]
LMP: Boy, I thought for a while there that some of those might get a little ... - ... I'd reset the program alarm in time for a ... out of there.

[05:12:59:10]
CMP: Will that one do? ...

[05:12:59:48]
LMP: Are you staying in this inertial attitude? Let's just leave it in REACQ then; it works just like a charm.

[05:12:59:55]
CMP: Yes, that's right.

[05:13:00:09]
CDR: How about that?

[05:13:00:59]

[05:13:01:02]
LMP: 403 I think we ...

CDR: This is not dumping.

[05:13:03:19]
CMP: I figured that.

[05:13:03:25]
CDR: Did you try the other line?

[05:13:03:26]
CMP: Well - no, I haven't tried a whole number of alternatives. In fact, number 1 is not dumping. My guess would be that it's something to do with this connection in the UCD or something like that. When you try to dump your ... regular urine bag, ... It's so goddam smelly, I hate to grab it and dick around with it, but I guess I got to.

[05:13:03:47]
CDR: Not entirely. I think I'd rather stick around ...

[05:13:04:40]

[05:13:05:36]
LMP: How long does it take to warm up this thing? 3 hours?

[05:13:05:38]

[05:13:05:54]

[05:13:10:11]
CDR: Well, when it gets to be light, we got to ...

[05:13:10:19]

LMP: Yes.

[05:13:13:03]

[05:13:13:08]
CDR: Isn't it in its place? Closet?

[05:13:13:10]
CMP: No, no, it's not in there. It doesn't have that closet anymore. The last I saw it, it was up on the MDC. I gave it - I handed it to one of you guys to -

[05:13:13:17]
LMP: Yes, I stuck it someplace.

[05:13:13:25]
CMP: Let's invent a new home for it because that old home is full of that smelly old urine bag.

[05:13:13:34]
CDR: The floodlight isn't - hasn't even made the bottom of the package warm yet, fellows.

[05:13:13:39]
LMP: Well, when it goes up there, we'll have to put it up here.

[05:13:17:10]
CMP: I got the tape - right underneath your couch. Okay?

[05:13:17:19]
LMP: Alright.

[05:13:17:25]
CMP: Okay, we need a new home for the tape. Anybody got any good suggestions?

[05:13:17:36]
CMP: Okay?

[05:13:17:39]
LMP: Alright.

[05:13:20:05]
LMP: Go ahead.

[05:13:21:25]

[05:13:23:05]
CMP: No, don't do it.

[05:13:23:06]

[05:13:23:07]
CMP: Don't do it.

[05:13:23:13]
LMP: Couldn't get it in, huh?

[05:13:23:15]

[05:13:23:51]
CMP: ..., Buzz?

[05:13:23:59]
LMP: ... some of that.

[05:13:24:59]

[05:13:26:45]

[05:13:26:51]
CDR: ...

[05:13:27:05]

CMP: Son-of-a-bitching - -

[05:13:33:43]
LMP: You did a pretty good ...

[05:13:33:49]
CMP: If I'd known how it was going to develop, I wouldn't have gone as far with the bottle as I did. I was in the habit of it, you know, as soon as contact is made, I look at it. It looks okay, I fire the bottle right away.

[05:13:33:56]

[05:13:33:57]

LMP: ...

[05:13:34:32]
CDR: No - they're way down so, I don't know - just ...

[05:13:34:34]

[05:13:35:10]

[05:13:38:55]
LMP: ... you guys. ... love them ...

[05:13:39:51]
CMP: All that probe and drogue and claptrap works; all that EVA transfer, you can forget about that and all those crazy procedures for taking that probe apart.

[05:13:40:12]
LMP: At least, we can forget them until the debriefing.

[05:13:45:38]
CMP: Yes. Yes, sir. Purring across the deep. Okay. Look at that.

[05:14:58:07]

[05:14:58:09]
CDR: No.

[05:14:58:11]
CMP: I'll take care of it for you.

[05:14:58:13]

[05:15:00:00]

[05:15:00:05]
CMP: 2 minutes prior, 100-degree line,

[05:15:00:18]
CDR: You got double lines?

[05:15:00:19]
CMP: Yes, I got double line on the 30, so I can use that as a head position ... look down between them.

[05:15:00:25]
CDR: They're not - they're not parallel? Can you see in the one-eye position?
_page : 228

[05:15:00:30]
CMP: What I'm saying is, on the 30 degree, I have both panes of glass - -

[05:15:00:34]
LMP: Yes.

[05:15:00:36]
CMP: - - and if you line those up then, then is your eye in the right position for all the others?

[05:15:00:39]
LMP: Yes.

[05:15:02:16]

[05:15:02:24]
CDR: Hey, you got - 1, 0.1, point 1 you mean?

[05:15:02:29]
CMP: Yes.

[05:15:02:44]
CMP: You know, if you hit this hand controller like you do in the simulator, MINIMUM IMPULSE, just bang it, it'll bang over and bang back, and it'll fire two opposing pulses, and you get nothing. You know that?
_page : 229

[05:15:02:53]

[05:15:05:18]
CMP: Oh, shit. ... yaw out 14 degrees. Why in the hell didn't I do that? Read that number wrong.

[05:15:05:29]
CDR: Yes, it should have been 1.4 degrees yaw.

[05:15:05:37]
LMP: That "1" gets moved over so far.

[05:15:05:40]
CMP: Yes, the goddam "1" in this computer, you know - trunnion angle, it's there; DELTA-V, it's there; angles, it's there. It's probably over here for something although I can't think for what, but there, there, there, and there, of course – there is four places.

[05:15:05:55]
LMP: Okay, we're there, Neil; by the time you can get down there and get your eyeball out the window - -

[05:15:06:01]
CMP: Oh, we'll crank them in the computer.

[05:15:06:03]

[05:15:07:26]

[05:15:12:29]
LMP: You going to pitch up after the burn?

[05:15:12:33]

[05:15:14:50]
LMP: Shades of Gemini retrofire, are you sure we're - (laughter) - No, let 's see - the motors point this way and the gases escape that way, therefore imparting a thrust that-a-way.
