P6: Okay. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

[00:05:22:37]
P6: MARK.

[00:05:22:38]
P6: 3 minutes.

[00:05:22:39]
C7: Roger. Made it.

[00:05:22:40]
C?: Okay. We're in sync.

[00:05:22:41]
P6: Okay. Our data look good. Yes, we're in a little
     close, Wally.

[00:05:22:42]
P6: ...

[00:05:22:44]
C6: Close?

[00:05:22:45]
P6: Yes, I mean we transferred a little late because ...
     we played conservative.

[00:05:22:47]
C6: Roger.

[00:05:22:48]
P6: How's our range rate doing?

[00:05:22:49]
C6: Okay. You want some of that? That's about 105.
     No, 155.

[00:05:22:54]
P6: That's good.

[00:05:22:55]
P6: Nominal's 165.

[00:05:22:58]
C6: I've got a real dim light out there.

[00:05:23:04]
C6: No. That's not it.

[00:05:23:22]
P6: A real dim light up there ...

[00:05:23:25]
P6: We'll blink it a couple times.

[00:05:23:36]
C6: ...

[00:05:23:37]
C6: Okay. That was it.

[00:05:23:39]
C7: It's off now.

[00:05:23:41]
_page : 63
P6: Okay ...

[00:05:23:43]
C7: It's coming on now.

[00:05:23:45]
P6: Roger ...

[00:05:23:49]
C7: And we don't have any ACQ lights ... zero.

[00:05:23:53]
C6: Yes. That's what I see. (First night sighting.)

[00:05:24:03]
P6: I don't want to blind you, Wally, on this thing.

[00:05:24:08]
C6: Good. I'll go ahead Frank.

[00:05:24:18]
P6: We've about 35 to go.

[00:05:24:20]
C6: About 35 degrees.

[00:05:24:21]
P7: Roger.

[00:05:24:24]
C6: Got the dock light on?

[00:05:24:29]
P6: ...

[00:05:24:34]
P6: The lights are on.

[00:05:24:36]
P6: ... turning dock light off.

[00:05:24:37]
C7: ... yet.

[00:05:24:38]
P6: ...

[00:05:24:39]
C6: Hurry up a bit so I can aline the platform.

[00:05:24:40]
P6: I have to get data.

[00:05:24:41]
P6: Hey, hold it right there! Stay where you are!

[00:05:24:42]
C6: ...

[00:05:24:43]
C7: You want me to do that or do you want me to stay
     where I am? I better stay where I am, I guess.

[00:05:24:44]
P6: 21.84.

[00:05:24:46]
P6: ...

[00:05:24:54]
_page : 64
P6: 38.3. Okay, you got her.

[00:05:24:56]
C6: Going down. (To aline platform.)

[00:05:25:00]
P6: Four.

[00:05:25:02]
C6: Three.

[00:05:25:54]
P6: Right on the line.

[00:05:26:03]
C6: Where's our plot?

[00:05:26:05]
P6: Right there.

[00:05:26:06]
C6: Start getting the point. You can talk to them about
     that.

[00:05:26:08]
P6: Yes.

[00:05:26:12]
P6: Gemini VII, VI. From our plot on the data point,
     looks like we're right on the line. The last data
     point was 38 degrees at about 22 miles.

[00:05:27:02]
C6: Pitching up at 10 minutes.

[00:05:27:04]
C6: Yes.

[00:05:27:08]
C6: Okay. I'll pitch up and look at you again, Frank.

[00:05:27:24]
C6: Pitch angle ... I better stay locked on.

[00:05:27:27]
P6: I got him.

[00:05:27:28]
C6: Blinking?

[00:05:27:29]
P6: You're blinking.

[00:05:27:30]
P6: Looks like you're blinking, Frank.

[00:05:27:34]
C6: Okay, that was him.

[00:05:27:46]
P6: A little to the right.

[00:05:27:52]
P6: About 50 degrees.

[00:05:27:54]
C6: About 50 degrees, Frank.

[00:05:28:00]
_page : 65
P6: Okay, let's get that data point.

[00:05:28:10]
C6: Right on.

[00:05:28:13]
P6: What do you get, Wally?

[00:05:28:14]
C6: It's 7 forward, 5 left, 7 up.

[00:05:28:19]
P6: 5 left and 7 up. Go get him!

[00:05:28:23]
C6: Up first?

[00:05:28:24]
P6: Yes. You can get thrust orthogonally if you want to.

[00:05:28:26]
C6: And forward last.

[00:05:28:27]
P6: Yes. Up and left.

[00:05:28:28]
C6: Yes.

[00:05:28:53]
P6: Okay. We have to track 15 to 17.

[00:05:28:57]
P6: About 55 degrees, Frank.

[00:05:29:04]
C6: Affirmative. Affirmative.

[00:05:29:05]
C6: He wants ... you to ...

[00:05:29:06]
P6: Yes. We need a tad up.

[00:05:29:07]
C6: Good.

[00:05:29:08]
P6: A little below. I'll take it off the ball.

[00:05:29:11]
P6: Wally, range rate, if you get a chance.

[00:05:29:12]
C6: Okay. About 105 to 110.

[00:05:29:15]
P6: Okay.

[00:05:29:16]
P6: Good show.

[00:05:29:17]
C6: Recording.

[00:05:29:19]
P6: Range-rate reading 110. The attitude is approximately
     55 off the ball. The range is 13.06.

[00:05:29:23]
C6: Good.

[00:05:29:51]
_page : 66
C6: Roger. About 62 degrees.

[00:05:29:55]
C6: Very good.

[00:05:33:09]
P6: Wally, how did it seem to track him with respect to
     stars on that reticle? This is just an evaluation.

[00:05:33:15]
P6: My stars look pretty bleak out there.

[00:05:33:56]
C6: I don't have any. There's the dock light.

[00:05:34:05]
C6: You're right on it now, Frank.

[00:05:34:14]
C6: Very good.

[00:05:34:15]
P6: Okay. Coming up to 15 minutes.

[00:05:34:21]
C6: Pretty good track. Dock light is bright as the
     Agena.

[00:05:34:39]
P6: If you get a chance, you can get me some range-rate
     readings.

[00:05:34:44]
C6: Less than 100. About 90 now.

[00:05:34:56]
P6: Good show!

[00:05:35:15]
P6: It's really bright now, isn't it? (Dock light.)

[00:05:35:16]
C6: Yes.

[00:05:35:32]
P6: 16 minutes.

[00:05:35:39]
C6: Sneaking up to meet you, Frank. Directly abeam and
     to the left are two stars called Castor and Pollux.

[00:05:35:57]
C6: Pitch.

[00:05:36:00]
P6: Ballpark pitch is about 70 degrees.

[00:05:36:15]
P6: The idea is we go ...

[00:05:36:16]
C6: Yes.

[00:05:36:21]
P6: Boy, the dock light knocks out the ACQ lights, doesn't
     it?

[00:05:36:24]
_page : 67
C6: Yes. Why don't you tell him? I'm too busy.

[00:05:36:25]
P6: Frank, you're just what we thought before. Your
     dock light completely wipes out the ACQ lights.

[00:05:36:32]
C6: Oh no, no, no! (Don't turn dock light off.)

[00:05:36:44]
P6: 7.77 (Range.)

[00:05:36:53]
P6: Okay. Zero addresses 25, 26 and 27. That's better.

[00:05:37:10]
P6: 74.2. Okay. 25.

[00:05:37:12]
C6: There are some stars out there. Good!

[00:05:37:36]
C6: You got 19 minutes?

[00:05:37:41]
P6: Coming up on 19.

[00:05:37:44]
P6: Sure do. I'd get the data otherwise.

[00:05:37:46]
C6: 27 ...

[00:05:37:49]
P6: Okay. Good show, Wally!

[00:05:38:24]
C6: Do you see Castor and Pollux?

[00:05:38:25]
P6: Oh, yes, I sure do.

[00:05:38:27]
C6: We're going to perform the backup check.

[00:05:38:29]
P6: Yes. Okay. Stand by ... Okay, you've got 3 seconds
     to go, Wally. 2, 1. MARK.

[00:05:38:38]
C6: Got it.

[00:05:38:44]
P6: We're about 10 degrees ahead of schedule but that
     isn't too bad. We transferred a little late ...
     with no sweat, Wally.

[00:05:38:53]
C6: Yes.

[00:05:38:54]
P6: Okay. Next data point will be at 22 minutes.

[00:05:38:58]
C6: Right.

[00:05:39:20]
P6: Okay. The next correction will probably be - may
     be a little bit up. Here it is; I have it for you
     on the plot. We're right there.

[00:05:39:23]
_page : 68
C6: Oh, yes.

[00:05:39:29]
P6: Here's where we transmit. We're coming right up
     to it.

[00:05:39:42]
P6: ... there are 20 minutes to go.

[00:05:39:44]
P6: 22 is 94.3. And that is 14.3. The total.

[00:05:39:54]
C6: ...

[00:05:40:00]
P6: I'm going to say 60 percent up.

[00:05:40:03]
C6: That's it, right?

[00:05:42:04]
P6: I can't get a photo.

[00:05:42:06]
C6: Oh, yes.

P6: Okay.

[00:05:45:45]
C6: This swung us in. Good going.

[00:05:45:51]

[00:05:45:59]
C6: R-dot is about 45 ... Good.

[00:05:46:00]

     pitch angle here, will you?

[00:05:46:05]
P6: Okay.

[00:05:46:12]
P6: 115 degrees on pitch. That ball ... pitch ...
     That's about right.

[00:05:46:17]
C6: Yes.

[00:05:46:22]

[00:05:46:44]
P6: 2 miles. 100 - 206. May be going up a little bit
     on you.

[00:05:47:07]
C6: No. It looks pretty good. We wish we had a
     parallel course.

[00:05:47:10]
_page : 71
C6: Yes. Pretty hard to argue. Good stars there.

[00:05:47:17]

[00:05:47:19]
C6: Yes.

[00:05:47:22]

[00:05:47:32]

[00:05:47:41]
C6: Coming right up.

[00:05:47:46]
C6: It's not going up nor down? Or right?

[00:05:47:51]
C6: Or right.

[00:05:47:59]
P6: How's the range rate?

[00:05:48:02]

C6: Okay.

[00:05:48:11]

[00:05:48:14]
P6: Okay. Go ahead and stop it.

[00:05:48:15]
C6: Yes.

[00:05:48:16]
C6: Distance now.

[00:05:48:19]
P6: Okay. 22 - -

[00:05:48:21]
C6: Very good.

[00:05:48:22]
P6: 125 degrees - 125 degrees at 1.2 miles.

[00:05:48:39]
P6: Yes, you better not let it go down now. I'll try
     to get another scale.

_page : 72
C6: Yes.

[00:05:49:05]
C6: Roger.

[00:05:49:12]
P6: One mile, Wally.

C6: Roger.

[00:05:49:24]

[00:05:49:30]
C6: That's right. Holding steady on the ball.

[00:05:49:38]
P6: Looks good.

[00:05:49:39]
C6: Yes.

[00:05:49:41]
C6: We're getting their light.

[00:05:49:43]

     waiting.

[00:05:49:46]

[00:05:49:47]
C6: Yes.

C6: Go ahead, Frank.

[00:05:57:50]
C7: I'm going to go ahead and put it on Inertial neutral

C6: Great ...

[00:05:57:57]
C7: Say again.

     those wires hanging there.

[00:05:59:45]
C7: Stop ... it on me.

[00:05:59:48]
C7: Where are they hanging from?

[00:05:59:51]
C6: Well, Frank, it looks like it comes out at the separation
     between - it might be the Fiberglas. It's
     approximately - oh - 10 to 15 feet long.

[00:06:00:00]
C7: The separation plane from the booster, right?

[00:06:00:02]
C6: Affirmative.

[00:06:00:03]
C7: That's exactly where you have one, too. It really
     belted around there when you were firing your
     thrusters.

[00:06:00:10]
C6: Looks like about 8 or 9 feet long and double wire.

[00:06:00:13]
C7: Right.

CC: VI and VII, Hawaii. We'll be standing by if you
     have anything for us.

[00:06:03:39]

     that's all.

[00:06:03:42]
CC: Call a policeman.

[00:06:03:46]
P6: It was pretty trying during the terminal run. As
     we looked out, we could see the two Gemini stars
     casting off to the right of Gemini VI - correction -
     VII. They were all in a line.

[00:06:03:59]
CC: Roger.

[00:06:06:24]
C7: We've lost you, VI.

[00:06:06:27]
C6: You've lost sight of me, sir?

[00:06:06:28]
C7: Roger.

[00:06:06:32]
C6: I must affirm a few little things.

[00:06:06:34]
C7: Okay.

[00:06:06:41]
C6: Keep to your left now.

[00:06:06:42]
C6: This is the night light, is it?

[00:06:06:45]
C7: Say again.

[00:06:06:46]
C6: This doesn't act like a night light, or is that an
     experiment light?

[00:06:06:49]
C7: No. They should both be off.

[00:06:07:09]
CC: VI, what's your range?

[00:06:07:13]
C6: 20 feet.

[00:06:07:16]
CC: Roger.

[00:06:08:21]
P7: The flag or the letters are ... Looks like they're
     seared as much at launch as they are when you come
     back from reentry.

[00:06:08:29]
_page : 81
P6: Jim, noticed your blue field is practically burned
     off.

[00:06:08:33]
P7: Right.

[00:06:08:39]
CC: Gemini VI, Houston.

[00:06:08:41]
C6: Go ahead, Elliot.

[00:06:08:43]
CC: Do you have an estimate of your TPI fuel and braking
     fuel?

[00:06:08:48]
C6: Roger. Stand by.

[00:06:09:25]
CC: Gemini VI, we're interested in Delta-V's on the
     terminal phase initiation and the braking, and also
     several million people are interested in a little
     more description of the braking and your stationkeeping.

[00:06:09:38]
P6: Roger, Elliot. Gemini VI. We've initiated with
     a Delta-V that was 031 forward. It started initially
     at 007 up and decreased to 004 up at initiation
     and right 001. At the completion of TPI
     we had 62 percent fuel remaining.

[00:06:10:07]
CC: Roger.

[00:06:10:08]
P6: And now for the big questions.

[00:06:10:12]
C6: We have about 49 now, Elliot.

[00:06:10:15]
CC: Roger. 49 percent now.

[00:06:10:18]
P6: That's affirmative. Our first stick course was
     007 forward, 005 left, and 007 up. The final mid-course
     was 004 forward, 06 right, and 003 up. This
     pretty much conforms with the plot. We're a little
     bit below the nominal line there - of the plot at
     that time. In the braking, we knocked up 27 feet
     per second Delta-V with our brakings. There's 27
     feet per second aft - a total of about 14 left.

[00:06:11:00]
CC: Roger. 27 feet per second aft and about 14 left.

[00:06:11:05]
P6: Roger. 14 left was the final one.

[00:06:11:09]
_page : 82
CC: Roger.

[00:06:11:10]
P6: And we will hit position at 120 feet per. We have
     indicating 50 percent fuel.

[00:06:11:18]
CC: Roger. Copy.

[00:06:11:19]
P6: R-dots, all the way through, looked fairly nominal
     and the one backup solution that I did get for the
     mid-course reads very close with the closed loop.

[00:06:11:30]
CC: Roger, Tom.

[00:06:11:31]
P6: Right now, we are SEF VII and BEF and we're - oh,
     I'd say what - 10 feet apart.

[00:06:11:37]
C6: Roger. About that.

[00:06:11:38]
P6: Yes.

[00:06:11:46]
CC: Say again, your range, VI.

CC: Gemini VII and VI, would you continue with the description
     of your stationkeeping?

[00:06:13:41]
C7: Right now, VI is about 10 feet above and to the
     left of VII. We're just flying nose to nose, approximately
     15 feet apart.

[00:06:13:51]
CC: Roger.

[00:06:13:53]
P7: We can very clearly see the horizon scanners up ...

[00:06:15:18]
P7: Wally, I can see your lateral thrusters are firing
     out about 40 feet from what we - visual, from what
     we can see.

[00:06:15:26]
_page : 83
C6: How are they doing?

[00:06:15:28]
P7: We can't tell now. We're in too close. But when
     you were doing your Braking Maneuver we could see
     them ... quite a bit out.

[00:06:15:47]
P7: I'll come back in, so we can get nose-to-nose a
     little bit.

[00:06:16:03]
P6: Looks like those wires guillotined off the booster
     and not at the spacecraft ...

[00:06:16:09]
C7: Yes, you have the same thing, only it's in back of
     yours.

[00:06:16:12]
C6: The wire bundles, of course.

[00:06:16:31]
CC: Gemini VI, did I understand you to report that
     thruster plumes were seen 40 feet out?

[00:06:16:40]
C6: That was Gemini VII, and I'm sure they saw them
     that far. We could see them; looks like within
     a ... down with them.

     thrusters fire quite a ways out.

P6: Did you wipe your mouth, Jim, after you ate?

[00:06:55:30]
P6: You must have just wiped your mouth, Jim. Did you?

P6: How's the visibility through these windows? They're
     pretty bad from this side.

CC: Gemini VI, Houston. We'd like a report on whether
     you have done a Fly-Around yet on the day side.

C6: The forest fires really kick them out, don't they,
     Jim?

[00:06:57:10]
P7: Right. They've been there all the time, Wally.

[00:06:57:12]
C6: Yes. That fire down there to your left is an oil
     fire, I think.

[00:06:57:18]
P7: Oh, you see one there from the air?

[00:06:57:21]
P6: Right. Maybe that was down to your left. It's

     see the fire way out to about 40 feet.

     like you to do prior to making the burn. We'd
     like you to move 5 to 10 feet north of Spacecraft

     making the burn. Now the reason for this is to
     keep the Spacecraft VII D-4/D-7 instrument away
     from the sun.

CC: Roger, Gemini VI. Can you tell me if the Spacecraft
     VII is above your altitude or below your altitude?

[00:22:32:48]
P6: He is above our altitude.

[00:22:32:51]
CC: He was above you when you got those readings?

[00:22:32:53]
P6: That is affirmative, and I have him in sight with
     reflected lights here.

[00:22:33:35]
CC: Gemini VI, Houston. Understand. Will you have any
     non-nominal stowage?

[00:22:33:41]
C6: We're considering leaving the water bags in the
     right aft box and not changing them to the left-hand
     box; otherwise, they will be identical.

[00:22:33:51]
CC: Roger. Water bags in the right aft as opposed to
     the left aft box.

[00:22:33:58]
C6: That is correct. They will be where they were
     for launch.

[00:22:34:02]
CC: Roger. Same place that they were in launch. And
     I'd like to reverify that, at the time these readings
     were taken, Gemini VII was above you.
