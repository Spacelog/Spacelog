This was the first of ten crewed Project Gemini missions which were designed to develop the spaceflight capabilities that would be required to go to the moon.\n\nThis site allows you to explore transcripts of radio communications between the Mercury 3 crew and the NASA personnel back at Cape Canaveral. Included with the transcripts are photographs, as well as other information about the mission.",
