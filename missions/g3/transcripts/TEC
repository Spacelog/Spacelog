CC: Very good.  We don't have any communications with the Cape at this time, but they have requested for me to run down your flight control problem a little bit.  The first thing I'd like to know is what kind of rates are you getting if you just let it yaw?

[00:02:23:57]
C: They are very slow, Pete. Probably on the order of a quarter of a degree per second.

CC: Okay and you are in a horizon scan mode, is that correct?

[00:02:24:13]
C: At the present time I'm in Pulse and alining the platform.

CC: Okay.  You're in pulse alining the platform.  Are your [glossary:ACME] logic yaw rate gryos and attitude drivers and all that stuff still primary?

[00:02:24:29]
_extra : CRO-2
C: Affirmative.

CC: Okay, strike all that other stuff. It sounds to me like you've got a mechanical problem in the valve. Is that what you figured?

[00:02:24:36]
_page : 58
C: Roger, it must be very, very slight. We can't see the pressure go down.

[00:02:24:40]
CC: Okay, and you have turned off 3, 4, 7 and 8 yaw circuit breakers and put them on again, and that didn't have any effect?

[00:02:24:46]
C: Yes, we've gone through everything, Pete.

[00:02:24:48]
CC: Okay, and no cross-coupling.

[00:02:24:50]
C: Negative.

CC: Okay. That should keep them happy back there. We are not going to send you a load. Your T<sub>R</sub> is good. I don't have your clock counting down with mine. I guess you have a different one in. We got your blood pressure and your clocks are on as far as SET goes.

[00:02:24:54]
C: That's — Pete.

[00:02:25:16]
C: Roger.

CC: And I have a question for John. I would like to know how his waste evaluation is doing.

[00:02:25:23]
P: In process. Tell him.

[00:02:25:26]
C: In process.

[00:02:25:27]
CC: In process. Roger. Roger.

[00:02:25:32]
CC: You have a GO down here from everybody, and do you have suit temps for me, please?

[00:02:25:42]
C: Yes, suit temp is running 58°, Pete. We are okay.

[00:02:25:45]
CC: Righto.

CC: Would you turn your real-time telemetry off after [glossary:LOS] from Carnarvon, please?

[00:02:26:31]
C: Roger, real-time off after Carnarvon.

[00:02:26:34]
CC: Yes. We didn't get a T<sub>X</sub> up to you.

[00:02:26:36]
C: Roger.

[00:02:27:02]
C: You're going to make these Horizon Scan Checks after a little bit?

[00:02:27:09]
P: Yes. You do it, because I'm busy here.

[00:02:27:14]
CC: [glossary:Molly Brown], this is Carnarvon. How do you read?

[00:02:27:18]
C: Still read you loud and clear.

[00:02:27:19]
CC: Okay, you'll probably go over the hill, Gus. You look good here on the ground. We'll see you on your next go.

[00:02:27:25]
C: Roger, thank you, Pete.

[00:02:28:24]
P: Be sure I don't throw any switches over there while I'm moving around.

[00:02:28:27]
C: No, I'll keep a check on you. I don't believe that scanner's doing the right thing by us at all. If it is, the ball isn't.

[00:02:31:25]
C: Want this bag for anything?

[00:02:31:27]
P: Yes, I put the paper towels back in it.

[00:02:31:29]
C: Okay, I can thrust now?

[00:02:31:31]
P: Wait till I get my suit zipped up.

C: Better get that sight out for me.

[00:02:32:11]
P: Huh?

[00:02:32:12]
C: Should get that sight out before long, too.

[00:02:32:13]
P: Okay.

[00:02:32:46]
C: I can't get the auxiliary light off there.

[00:02:33:29]
C: It's really black out there.

[00:02:33:31]
P: Yep.

[00:02:33:46]
C: I've got a scanner ignore light. Shoot, that ball must be way off.

[00:02:33:59]
P: Okay.

[00:02:34:01]
C: Oh, man! It's hot.

[00:02:34:03]
P: What's the matter, Gus?

[00:02:34:04]
C: Oh, there it is. I was losing the horizon. Don't tell me our secondary scanners are out now. That isn't right. Let's see what happens. This ball is way off. Good night! Our ball has drifted way off. Let's just go into daylight and aline the thing.

[00:02:34:50]
P: You've got the answer.

[00:02:34:58]
C: Pulse. Going to use those stars. There's zero roll all right.

[00:02:35:30]
P: Well, that's great! I can't bust up the bag. Sure like to get that smell out of here and the only way I can do it is to bust that bag.

[00:02:35:41]
C: What bag?

[00:02:35:42]
P: It won't break.

[00:02:35:43]
C: What do you mean?

[00:02:35:44]
P: I mean this bacteriacide bag.

[00:02:35:59]
_page : 61
P: Got it — a little.

[00:02:36:25]
P: There we go.

[00:02:36:48]
C: We're coming into daylight again.

[00:02:37:08]
C: Does that look roll-level to you?

[00:02:37:10]
P: Looks what?

[00:02:37:11]
C: Is that level to you? Looking out the window.

[00:02:37:20]
P: Yes.

[00:02:37:22]
C: What about yaw? I can't really tell yaw, can you?

[00:02:37:26]
P: No.

[00:02:37:28]
P: Have you got that —

[00:02:37:30]
C: What?

[00:02:37:43]
C: Let's see. You don't see the moon any place, do you?

[00:02:37:46]
P: No.

[00:02:37:49]
C: It'll be coming up over my — on my right here pretty soon.

[00:02:37:59]
P: Boy, I tell you I really dig this zero g. This is the finest way to go I ever saw.

[00:02:39:26]
C: That looks about right in pitch. Roll is off.

[00:02:39:31]
P: Can you stick this on your side?

[00:02:39:34]
C: That mess? Doesn't that go in your food box?

[00:02:39:40]
P: Would if there was any room in it.

[00:02:39:43]
C: I don't have any room.

[00:02:39:45]
P: I don't either.

[00:02:39:46]
C: Drop it back behind the seat, I guess.

[00:02:39:51]
_page : 62
P: I'll try to stick it in the food box.

[00:02:40:30]
P: Okay, what does the flight plan say about here, Gus?

[00:02:40:33]
C: I'm supposed to be doing the Horizon Scanner Check, but I don't have time to do it.

[00:02:40:41]
P: Oh, okay. Well thanks, I'm done. I'm supposed to be doing that O<sub>2</sub> High Rate Check. Is it at 2:40 in the flight plan?

[00:02:40:49]
C: Yes. 2:40 right now.

[00:02:40:53]
P: Okay, we'll got to O<sub>2</sub> High Rate. I've —

[00:02:40:56]
C: Man! The primary scanners are working! How about that!

[00:02:40:59]
P: I got to have some light here to look at the oxygen gages. Is that all right?

[00:02:41:02]
C: Yeah, I just can't figure out —

[00:02:41:06]
P: Okay, I'll go to O<sub>2</sub> High Rate. O<sub>2</sub> High Rate isn't the way to go.

[00:02:41:28]
P: Okay, MARK. O<sub>2</sub> High Rate.

[00:02:41:29]
C: I'm sure uncomfortable.

[00:02:41:30]
P: Yes, it's bad.

[00:02:41:31]
C: Let's leave the heater switch off and let the oxygen pressure come down a bit.

[00:02:41:33]
P: It will come down, and I mean it will come down!

[00:02:41:36]
C: You got the batteries on?

[00:02:41:37]
P: And at the start of the O<sub>2</sub> High Rate Check, O<sub>2</sub> quantity was reading 65 percent. Cabin pressure was 5.1. Cabin pressure is building slowly.

[00:02:42:17]
P: Look at that suit inlet temperature go up.

[00:02:42:23]
_page : 63
C: Is that moon coming up at about the right spot for you for zero yaw?

[00:02:42:26]
P: I don't see it over here, Gus.

[00:02:42:29]
C: Almost dead ahead. Maybe it's daylight. Maybe it's the sunrise.

[00:02:42:44]
C: Thruster sounds are about like the trainer, aren't they?

[00:02:42:49]
P: Yeah, not bad, is it? See, the O<sub>2</sub> pressure is coming down now. Okay, the mains coming on the line, in case we need the heaters.

[00:02:42:59]
C: Got the scanners again, I guess. That's what I got the last time.

[00:02:43:04]
P: Yeah. Okay, the O<sub>2</sub> pressure is now down to 925 and we have been on O<sub>2</sub> High Rate two minutes. Coming up on two minutes.

[00:02:43:13]
C: What was that?

[00:02:43:14]
P: Cabin pressure relief valve. Cabin pressure relief valve relieves with a loud shhh!

[00:02:43:21]
C: Still don't have that scanner light out. There it goes. That's what caused that thing to go out the last time—when you turned those mains on.

[00:02:43:28]
P: The horizon scanner?

[00:02:43:30]
C: Yes, but it came back on again, though.

[00:02:43:34]
P: That son-of-a-gun is relieving at 5.8, isn't it?

[00:02:43:43]
P: Okay, 2 minutes and 30 seconds O<sub>2</sub> High Rate.

[00:02:43:59]
P: And the Greenwich mean time is 1707.

[00:02:44:07]
C: Hey, give me that sight down there.

[00:02:44:10]
P: Okay.

[00:02:44:11]
_page : 64
C: I'll miss my tracking task.

[00:02:44:16]
P: You know what they did, they turned the sight around.

[00:02:44:19]
C: Really?

P: Yes.

[00:02:44:23]
P: Okay, that's three minutes and ten seconds of O<sub>2</sub> High Rate. Don't want to stay on it five minutes. I think that is more than a guy can stand. The suit inlet temperature is up to 64 and pressure is down to 825. We will shoot it a shot of manual heaters here when it gets to 800.

[00:02:45:15]
P: Okay, MARK. Four minutes on the O<sub>2</sub> High Rate Check. Now we will go to the first shot of manual heaters.

[00:02:45:29]
C: Man! It's almost impossible to see out with the sight in front of you.

[00:02:45:36]
P: Pressure is still dropping. Now it's coming up. Okay.

[00:02:45:59]
C: When you get that scanner light it pitches you right down.

[00:02:46:01]
P: Yeah. That's what they said it'd do, didn't they? Okay, 10 seconds to go, and been holding the manual heater switch in for the last minute. It's keeping the pressure up to 825.

[00:02:46:10]
C: Oh, man! That ball is staying way off —

[00:02:46:13]
P: Okay, MARK. O<sub>2</sub> High Rate recocked.

[00:02:46:15]
C: Give me the mark when you think I've got zero yaw.

[00:02:46:18]
P: Okay.

[00:02:46:24]
C: Oh, man! I don't know about this.

[00:02:46:27]
P: Turning the auto heater off.

[00:02:46:34]
_page : 65
P: Can't see a thing, Gus. The quantity at the end of the O<sub>2</sub> High Rate Check was down to 62 percent. Started at 66 and ended 62. I can't see a thing out the window, Gus, because of the sun.

[00:02:46:58]
C: This is about zero yaw.

[00:02:47:01]
P: Go a little bit left.

[00:02:47:07]
P: That looks pretty good, although —

[00:02:47:09]
C: That's about what we had in pitch attitude for zero before, wasn't it?

[00:02:47:12]
P: Yes.

[00:02:47:14]
P: Okay. At 2:40 in the flight plan —

[00:02:47:22]
C: That shows 30° off on the ball.

[00:02:47:31]
P: Started out at 66 and ended at 62, at 2:40.

P: We come across the coast at 3:04. What time is it?

[00:02:47:44]
C: That's too much pitch-up for zero attitude, don't you think?

[00:02:47:48]

C: Coming up?

[00:02:48:10]
P: Yes. Well, I'm going to turn them off now and see what happens. Okay. The mains are off. Been on seven minutes while we were on O<sub>2</sub> High Rate. Okay, we are down to 62 percent at three hours. We are two percent under what we should be. That ought to be good enough for a couple of orbits.

[00:02:48:41]
C: I really can't tell whether I have zero yaw or not. What do you think?

[00:02:48:46]
P: Get off some and then I can tell.

[00:02:48:49]
C: I'll take this sight down out of here a second.

[00:02:48:58]

[00:04:08:35]
P: Okay.

[00:04:12:35]
P: And that old suit temp down there at 55°, S-band-CONTINUOUS, C-band-CONTINUOUS, [glossary:T/M] in REAL-TIME and ACQ.

[00:04:12:44]
P: Main batteries - we tested them. They checked good. C is way up there at 29, S2 —

[00:04:12:53]
C: Man! With that sun shining on the nose, I can't see anything now.

[00:04:12:57]

P: Every time you fire those [glossary:RCS] thrusters S1 and S2 drop voltage. Well, that's not unusual.

[00:04:13:00]

[00:04:13:03]

[00:04:13:07]

[00:04:13:12]
C: Man! I hope the 8-ball is right, because there's no horizon.

[00:04:13:24]
P: Okay. Now 4:06 after retrofire is 400K, and 11 minutes after retrofire is reverse.

[00:04:13:33]

C: 4:06

[00:04:13:51]
C: And what is reverse?

[00:04:13:52]
P: Eleven minutes flat. That sounds about right, because it was 10 minutes and 51 seconds from our nominal data.

[00:04:14:00]
C: There is still no horizon.

[00:04:14:03]
P: Okay. Give me a mark, and let me check T<sub>R</sub> one more time.

[00:04:14:09]

[00:04:14:12]
P: Okay.

[00:04:14:14]
