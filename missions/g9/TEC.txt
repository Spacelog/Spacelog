         00:36:36 C   Houston, Gemini IX ...
         00:36:40 CC  We're reading you a little bit garbled, Tom.
                      That was check your Tape Recorder Power circuit
                      breaker?
         00:36:47 C   Roger.
         00:49:04 P   I felt that one! I felt that one, Tom!
         00:49:09 P   I sure felt that.
         00:49:23 C   Go.
         00:49:25 P   Okay. The burn time is 1:40 so we should read -
                      5043 at the completion time. Right?
         00:49:30 C   Right.
         00:49:39 P   We still have about 40 - 50 percent yet to go.
         00:49:59 P   Feels like I urinated out in my pants.
         00:50:01 P   Oop! That went in the report.
         00:50:04 C   That's all right. ... still burning?
         00:50:08 P   Yes.
         00:50:11 C   Okay.
         00:50:16 P   The quantity is 5043 on the counter and I get to
                      go on 80.
         00:50:28 P   Okay. I have about 13 to go. I'm 80.
         00:50:32 P   Going over 82. Got about 10 seconds to burn.
         00:50:40 C   Okay. Hit it.
         00:50:42 P   Okay. There's 82. 82 is good.
         00:50:47 P   All zeros. 81 plus 2. That's good enough.
	Page 18

              00:50:59  P    Okay.
              00:51:04  P    He wants - -
              00:51:05  C    Hit it again ... two tenths is good enough.
              00:51:11  P    One tenth.
              00:51:12  C    One tenth plus - -
              00:51:18  P    Plus one tenth on 80, plus two tenths on 81 and

              00:51:24  CC   Go ahead, Gemini IX.
              00:51:25  C    Roger. Completed our purge right on time; residuals
                             were for ... We're standing by for the
                             Accelerometer Bias Check. We'll give you a call
                             as soon as we have all addresses to zero.
              00:51:41  CC   Roger. Would you give us that residual again,
                             please?
              00:51:45  P    Roger. Address 80, plus one tenth; 81, plus two
                             tenths; 82, was zero.
              00:51:55  CC   Roger. Now we'll give you a GO on the radiator.
                             You can place the Evaporator switch to NORMAL.
              00:52:01  C    Roger. NORMAL.
              00:52:07  C    We're showing all zeros for 25:67 ... Ready to
                             START COMP.
              00:52:12  CC   Stand by one, Gemini IX.
              00:52:42  CC   IX, Carnarvon.

	Page 19

        00:52:44 CC  Carnarvon's having some telemetry problems.
                     I'll give you a call as soon as we're set up
                     here.
        00:52:47 C   Okay.

        00:53:10 C   Gemini IX. Go.
        00:53:12 CC  Roger. Will you cycle back to PRELAUNCH and
                     then back to CATCH-UP, please?
        00:53:15 C   Roger. How about going to RENDEZVOUS position?
        00:53:17 CC  Okay.
        00:53:22 CC  Roger. We'll start the Accelerometer Bias
                     Check.
        00:53:25 C   Roger. START COMP this ...
        00:53:30 C   Do you have us GO for 16-1?
        00:53:34 CC  Roger. You're GO for 16-1.
        00:55:24 CC  Gemini IX, Carnarvon. Would you place the
                     Quantity Read switch to ECS O<sub>2</sub>?
        00:55:29 C   Come to ECS O<sub>2</sub>.
        00:55:50 CC  FUEL CELL O<sub>2</sub>.
        00:55:53 C   Roger. FUEL CELL O<sub>2</sub>.

        00:56:24 C   H<sub>2</sub>.
        00:56:40 CC  The Quantity Read is OFF.
        00:56:45 C   Roger. It's OFF.
        00:56:46 CC  Would you give us an OAMS Quantity readout,
                     please?
        00:56:55 C   OAMS Quantity reads 82 percent.
	Page 20

          00:56:58 CC  Roger.
          00:57:40 CC  Gemini IX, Carnarvon. We've completed our
                       accelerometer bias summaries.
          00:57:45 C   Fine.
                             CANTON
           01:10:07 CC  Gemini IX, Houston standing by.
           01:10:11 C   Roger, Houston.
           01:12:23 CC  Gemini IX, Houston. Can you tell us whether
                        you saw any drift on your IVI during your
                        Accelerometer Bias Checks?
           01:12:30 C   Roger. Just did now....we saw the UP go to
                        a 1 ... UP to 1, very small.
           01:12:43 CC  Roger. UP went to 1 and LEFT-RIGHT went to 1.
                         Is that right?
           01:12:47 C   That's right.
           01:12:49 CC   Okay.
           01:12:50 C   Want another one?
           01:12:52 CC   Stand by. I don't think it's required.
           01:12:55 C    Roger.
           01:12:56 CC   We will update your Accelerometer Bias over the
                         States.
           01:13:03 C    Houston, say again.
           01:13:04 CC   We will update your Accelerometer Bias over the
                         States.

         01:17:39 C   Hawaii, Gemini IX.
         01:17:41 CC  Roger. You look real good here on the ground.
                      We have a 250-nautical-mile-range update for
                      you.
         01:17:48 P   Roger. Stand by.
         01:17:52 C   Go ahead, Hawaii.
         01:17:54 CC  Roger. GET: 0l:40:00.
         O1:18:02 P   Roger. 01:40:00.
         01:18:05 CC  We also have a Flight Plan update for you.
         01:18:08 C   Roger. Go ahead.
         01:18:11 CC  Node: 01:13:39; Rev 1, 172.6 degrees west;
                      right ascension, 20:09.
         01:18:34 C   Roger. Node: 01:13:39; Rev 1, 172.6 degrees
                      west; right ascension, 20:09.
         01:18:46 CC  Roger. We have turned the L-Band ON on the
                      ATDA and it looks good.
         01:18:50 C   Real fine.
         01:21:12 CC  Gemini IX, Hawaii. We're at LOS minus 1 and
                      all systems look good.
         01:21:17 P   Gemini IX. Roger.
                           CALIFORNIA
         01:28:08 CC  Gemini IX, Houston.
         01:28:13 C   Houston, IX here. Go.
         01:28:16 CC  Roger. Your 180-nautical-mile time is 1 plus 56.
	Page 22

            01:28:22 C    Roger. 1 plus 56.
            01:28:24 CC   And 1OO nautical miles will be 2 plus 39.
            01:28:29 C    Roger.
            01:28:33 CC   Okay. This current maneuver plan that we're
                          working on, Tom, has a Delta-H at 12 nautical
                          miles and a TPI at 4 minutes before sunset.
            01:28:42 C    Roger. Delta-H, 12 miles; TPI at 4 minutes
                          before sunset. Sounds real good.
            01:28:48 CC   Roger. There will be no stars for either burn.
            01:28:52 C    Say again.
            01:28:53 CC   You won't have any stars for either burn. One's
                          in daylight and one's pointed down.
            01:28:58 C    I've come to the decision that it's real hard
                          to see stars.

            01:29:38 CC   Houston, Tom.
            01:29:39 C    Roger, Neil. My Left Auxiliary Receptacle -
                          evidently the total unit over there is inoperative,
                          so we're going to make a little makeshift
                          here, and use a cord stretched across the
                          cockpit to the Receptacle Right Auxiliary.
            01:29:53 CC   Roger. Understand. You're - I guess both sides
                          are on that same breaker, right?
            01:30:00 P    Right.
            01:30:01 C    It's definitely in the connector and the connector
                          is loose on the receptacle. There,
                          we've got it.
            01:30:06 CC   I'm with you.

        01:30:07 C   Squared away.
        01:30:23 CC  Okay. You want to go to PRELAUNCH now, Tom,
                     for the Accelerometer Bias change.
        01:30:28 C   Going to PRELAUNCH.
        01:30:32 C   PRELAUNCH.
         01:30:35 CC  Okay.
        01:31:02 CC  Okay. Your bias is being changed now, IX.
        01:31:07 C   ...
         01:31:16 CC  We didn't read you that time. Understand you
                      did get a light.
         01:31:21 C   Roger. That's affirmative. Now we're going to
                      take some pictures. How do you read me on the
                      UHF?
         01:31:28 CC  We're reading you loud with a little bit of
                      garble, Tom.
         01:31:32 C   Roger.
         01:31:33 CC  Can you change that receptacle cord from one
                      side to the other for later in the flight?
         01:31:41 C   It's the receptacle itself, Neil. We're going
                      to still make the effort to complete the rendezvous
                      and check it out.
         01:31:48 CC  Okay.
         01:32:17 CC  Advise your bias looks good now, Gemini IX.

	Page 25

        01:45:30 CC  Gemini IX, Houston. We're about half a
                     minute from LOS. You still have a very small
                     bias in the accelerometer. Looks like, for
                     worse case TPI, we will be off about a couple-of-tenths
                     of a foot per second. You might have
                     a look at it.
        01:45:48 C   Roger, Houston. Sure will.
        01:54:20 C   Recording for MCC. The burn is 1 plus 55 plus
                     17.
        01:54:31 P   Okay. There's ten.
        01:54:54 P   Go to RATE COMMAND - there's 13.
        01:55:04 C   RATE COMMAND.
        01:55:06 P   14, 15, 16, -

        01:55:22 C   Burning.
        01:55:25 P   Okay. I've got your timing. Should be a 19-second
                     burn.
        01:55:39 C   MARK.
        01:55:42 P   That was the 10-second burn right on the money.
        01:55:44 C   Okay. 82 is zero.
        01:55:47 P   82 is zero. 81.
        01:55:54 C   Two tenths.
        01:55:55 P   Minus two.
        01:55:56 C   81. Do you want to ...

                         Let it go.
           01:56:12 P    Skip it.
           01:56:13 P    Okay.
           01:56:27 C    There we go. There we go. Call in the residuals
                         to him.
           01:56:31 P   Who's that, Houston or Canaries?
           01:56:32 C    Houston.
           01:56:34 P   Houston, Gemini IX. Burn was on time. All residuals
                        are zero. 80, 81 and 82 all zeros.
           01:56:41 CC  Very good.
           01:56:46 P   Okay. Back to PULSE.
           01:5S:49 C   Good show. Back to PULSE.
           01:56:51 C   Going to RENDEZVOUS.
           01:56:53 C   Back to CATCH-UP.
           01:56:59 C   Plat to ...
           01:57:01 C   Okay. You can put 81 percent after that, if you
                        want to. 81 percent limit.
           01:57:06 P   Houston, Gemini IX. Fuel Quantity is 81 percent.
           01:57:09 C   ... 81 percent.
           01:57:13 CC  You're 81 percent.
           01:57:22 CC  Houston is one minute from LOS.
           01:57:25 C   Roger. Read you loud and clear.
           01:57:26 C   Whew! I'm awful glad at this IGS support.
           01:57:28 P   Yes, so am I.
	Page 27

        01:57:37 P   Boy, you sure sit on top of the cockpit, don't
                     you?
        01:57:41 C   Yes. You feel like you're bent over, head down.
        01:57:56 P   I lost a pencil somewhere.
        01:57:57 C   Sure, we'll find it. We'll find it on the ship.
        01:58:05 P   Well.
        01:58:08 P   Yes, but in case I break this one, I'll need one
                     in a hurry.
        01:58:10 C   I've got plenty. I've got two over here - and
                     we're back Alining the Platform.
        01:58:20 P   Okay.
        01:58:21 C   ... to CATCH-UP.
        01:58:25 CC  Houston is one minute from LOS.
        01:58:27 C   Roger. We're Realining the Platform.
        01:58:44 P   Okay, Tom, she's all set in. This one is going
                     to be Posigrade Down and north. It's going to be
                     3 degrees left and 41 degrees down.
        01:58:48 C    3 degrees left.
        01:58:49 P    And 41 degrees down.
        01:58:50 C    I hope.
        01:59:01 P    Boy, RATE COMMAND is a heck of a lot tighter
                     than simulation.
        01:59:06 C    It's really tight.
        01:59:10 P   Boy! 41 degrees down. That's a big one!
        01:59:18 P   Do you want to get that center box and stow it,
                     Tom?
        01:59:20 C   When's the next burn we'll be running?
	Page 28

           01:59:22 P    Next burn is at 02:24:51.
           01:59:27 C    02:24:51. Okay.
           01:59:32 C    02:24:51. Good.
           01:59:35 C    Go ahead and start ... start working on it.
           01:59:39 P    This cord is a pain in the neck.
           01:59:44 P    Let's go to Record, OFF.

           02:10:10 CC   Roger. We're reading you now. Give you a time
                         hack here. It will be 2 hours, 10 minutes and
                         20 seconds.
           02:10:20 CC   MARK.
           02:10:22 C    Roger. We're right on.
           02:10:25 CC   Okay. And 4 minutes after N<sub>SR</sub> your pointing will
                         be 5.5 degrees above horizontal; azimuth, 0; and
                         your range, 109 miles with a Range-Rate of 126
                         feet per second.
           02:10:45 C    Roger. Understand 109 miles and 126 feet per
                         second.
           02:10:49 CC  Roger. 5.5 degrees above horizontal.
           02:11:06 C   Houston ... Say again.
           02:11:11 CC  That elevation was 5.5 degrees.

        02:11:14 C   Roger. 5.5.
        02:11:17 CC  Roger.
        02:11:59 C   Houston, this is Gemini IX. Were you trying to
                     call?
        02:12:03 CC  No we weren't, Tom. Advise you are about 150
                     nautical miles. Have you had any ACQ - radar
                     acquisition blinking yet?
        02:12:15 C    Not yet, but we'll give you a call when we have
                      it.
        02:12:17 CC   Roger.
        02:13:22 C    Houston, Gemini IX.
        02:13:24 CC   This is Houston. Go ahead.
        02:13:25 C    Roger. There appears to be a radar lock-on.
        02:13:28 CC   Roger. Can you read out the range, please?
        02:13:35 C    We are 129.45 miles and we'll get you a Range-
                      Rate shortly.
        02:13:40 CC   Roger.
        02:13:49 C    And we've lost radar lock. I just lost it
                      completely.
        02:13:52 CC   Roger. Understand you've lost it.
        02:13:54 C    Came back in again, and out.
        02:14:02 C   Houston, Gemini IX. We did get a Range-Rate of
                     201 feet per second. I don't know how good that
                     is.
        02:14:08 CC  Roger. 201.
        02:14:38 C   Houston, Gemini IX. We are at 127 and a half
                     miles; Range-Rate, 190.
        02:14:44 CC  Houston. Roger.

           02:15:17 CC  Houston. Roger. And we're about 1 minute from
                        LOS.
           02:15:23 C   Roger. The radar keeps breaking lock just as
                        predicted.
           02:15:28 CC  I understand.
           02:23:41 P   Okay. We're coming up for N<sub>SR</sub> burn at 02:24:51.
                        We've got about a minute to go.
           02:23:43 C   Let's recycle again back in the ...
           02:23:46 P   54 feet per second.
           02:23:52 C   Okay. Put back to CATCH-UP.
           02:23:58 C   The needles aren't coming in.
           02:24:03 P   No.
           02:24:05 C   Try again. We should have left it then. There
                        we go. Okay. Just leave it there.
           02:24:10 P   Okay. We're losing the radar lock-on, but that's
                        expected.
           02:24:13 C   ...
           02:24:17 P   24:51, Tom. We've got 30 seconds.
           02:24:19 C   Okay.

        02:24:51 P    Okay. It is 47.
        02:24:52 P    8, 9, 50, BURN.
        02:24:53 C    MARK.
        02:24:54 C    BURN.
        02:24:55 P   We're burning, Carnarvon.
        02:24:58 CC  Roger.
        02:25:25 P    Our radar lock's holding pretty good, isn't it?
        02:25:34 P  The needle isn't moving each time. I wonder
                     why?
        02:25:41 C    I don't know.
        02:25:49 P   Got about 10 seconds to burn.
        02:25:53 C   Okay.
        02:26:01 C   Okay. Hit it!
        02:26:08 P   Okay. 80 - let's see, 80, 81 and 82. You've
                     got to go down just a little.
        02:26:20 P   Let me hit it again. Okay. Stand by.
        02:26:25 C   That's good. 82 is one.
        02:26:27 P   Yes.
	Page 32

           02:26:34 C   81 is 1.
           02:26:43 C   It's coming in, too.
           02:26:51 P   Yes.
           02:26:52 C    Six tenths.
           02:26:56 P   One squeeze.
           02:26:57 C    Hit it!
           02:26:58 P    I don't believe that. Why would - -
           02:27:01 C    Okay. Just let it go.
           02:27:04 C    Zero, zero. Make it a zero, okay?
           02:27:08 P    Carnarvon, this is Gemini IX. Burn is complete.
                         The residuals: 80 is 0; 81 is 1; 82 is 1.
           02:27:17 CC   Roger. Standing by for your fuel cell purge.
           02:27:20 P   Roger. Coming up on the purge.
           02:27:27 C    Did you get the time up there?
           02:27:28 P    For what?
           02:27:31 C    Did you start ... ?
           02:27:35 P    Did I get the time ... ?
           02:28:53 C   Carnarvon, Gemini IX. Purged hydrogen Sections
                         1 and 2, got a Delta-P light. Presently purging
                        oxygen Section 1.
           02:29:01 CC  Roger.
           02:32:25 CC  Gemini IX, we're 30 seconds to LOS.
           02:32:29 C    ... Roger. We got about 20 seconds on the Section
                        2 O<sub>2</sub> purge and I did not get any lights.
           02:32:36 CC  Roger. Would it be possible for me to get an
                       OAMS Quantity readout from you before LOS here?
	Page 33

       02:32:40 P   Roger. Reading 73 percent.
       02:32:42 CC  Roger.
       02:32:47 C   Carnarvon, we also need a Bravo.
       02:32:49 CC  Roger.
       02:32:50 CC  Gemini.
       02:32:51 C   Gemini IX, fuel cell purge is complete. Everything
                    looks good.
       02:32:53 CC  Roger.
                         HAWAII
       02:50:28 C   Hello, Hawaii. Gemini IX.
       02:50:30 CC  Gemini IX, Hawaii.
       02:50:32 C   Roger. We've had a computer malfunction. Want
                    to clue you in on it.
       02:50:39 CC  Roger. Go ahead.
       02:50:42 C   Okay. We noticed this after the N<sub>SR</sub> burn. Every
                    time we would go from RENDEZVOUS back to CATCH-UP,
                    the COMP light would come on without starting and
                    the IVIs would display. This showed we were getting
                    some signal in that would start the computation
                    cycle. Okay, went to RENDEZVOUS and after
                    the total data points, we got the first solution
                    displayed. The START COMP light then came on and
                    it cranked up the solution for this range, and it
                    would not give a second data point. We went over
                    to CATCH-UP and it had the same values in CATCH-UP
                    that we had in RENDEZVOUS and, naturally, the
                    light was on, which shows that we are holding it
                    in the register. It appears that after every
                    eighth data point all we'll get is that solution
                    and nothing more. Our Delta-Delta-R shows that
                    we are about 2-1/2 miles high for 15 which is 12.5
                    and the list isn't too bad and the radar is doing
                    beautifully. You want to relay that on to Houston?

	Page 34

          02:51:49 CC  Roger. Will do.
          02:51:55 CC  Everything is looking real good here on the
                       ground. We still read you've got solid lock.
          02:52:00 C   Roger. We do have solid locking. Occasionally
                       it will break and the needles act too wild.
          02:52:05 CC  Roger.
          02:53:21 C   Hawaii, Gemini IX. We're back in Rendezvous Mode
                       to try to stay Closed Loop. We are getting good
                       Delta-R's out of our computation. We will let
                       you know when we get our next solution.
          02:53:32 CC  Roger. Will do. And Houston says they'll talk
                       to you about the problem over the States.
          02:53:36 C   Roger. It's just the same as if we START COMP
                       every time we turn to the Catch-up and Rendezvous
                       Modes.
          02:53:42 CC  Roger. Understand.
          02:53:50 CC  Gemini IX, Hawaii. Houston says they confirm
                       the Delta-H.
          02:53:55 C   Roger.
          02:54:56 CC  Gemini IX, Hawaii.
          02:54:57 C   Hawaii. Go.
          02:54:59 CC  The ATDA has been configured for Rendezvous and
                       all lights are ON at this time.
          02:55:03 C   Roger. Real fine.
          02:55:17 P   Hawaii, this is Gemini IX. We're presently 8
                       degrees and 76.67 miles; Range-Rate, 126.
         02:55:24  CC  Roger. Copy.
         02:56:17  C   Hawaii. Gemini IX is 8.6 degrees; 74.58 miles;

                          HOUSTON
        02:59:52 C    Hello, Hawaii. Gemini IX.
        03:00:01 CC   Hello, Gemini IX. Houston here.
        03:00:03 C    Roger. Houston, Gemini IX. We've just gone
                     through another cycle on the computer in the
                     Rendezvous Mode. It brings up the first solution
                     and then immediately goes down to give us the
                     same as if we had pushed START COMP, Neil.
        03:00:15 CC   Roger. And understand it does that at the eighth
                     data point. Is that correct?
        03:00:18 C    Yes. We're coming up to 9 degrees and going down
                     to Aline the Platform.
        03:00:22 CC   Roger. Understand you are going to Aline now.
                    We're going to try to work out the best time we
                     can for you to cycle into Rendezvous Mode so that
                     you get a correct solution at the proper time.
        03:00:36 C   Okay. We already thought about this one up here.
        03:00:40 CC   I'm sure you did.
        03:02:09 C   Hello, Houston. IX here.
        03:02:10 CC  Go ahead, IX.
        03:02:13 C   Okay. We just thought of another thing up here,
                     Neil. If we get that solution right at that
                     point, and it's bad, and we have to go to CATCH-UP
                     to make the burns, we will have to treat the
                     IVIs to do it.
        03:02:27 CC  Roger.
                           GUAYMAS
        03:02:52 C   Our analysis on-board, Houston, is that something
                    is initiating the START COMP cycle. We noticed

	Page 36

                        this just as we finished the N<sub>SR</sub> burn.
           03:03:04 CC  Roger. We're with you. Just to advise you here,
                        you've got less than 1 mile relative ellipticity,
                        so it's going to be reasonably easy to predict
                        the proper TPI.
            03:03:17 C   Roger. Our Delta-Delta-R shows we're in pretty
                         good shape, too, up here.
            03:03:21 CC  Roger.
            03:06:39 P   Houston, Gemini IX. 9.6 degrees; range, 61.67;

            03:10:20 C   Hello, Houston. Gemini IX.
            03:10:22 CC  Go ahead.
            03:10:24 C   Roger. We're still Alining the Platform here,
                         Neil.

                         Platform Alinement. We're pitching up to the
                         target.
            03:13:50 CC  IX. Houston has turned TPI up when you are ready
                         to copy.
            03:13:54 C   Roger. Ready to copy.

               03:15:56       CC      Roger. It's 03:35:35.
               03:15:59       P       That's 03:35:35. Thank you.
               03:16:01       C       And we've had another COMP cycle and it's done
                                      exactly the same as the previous cycles. As
                                      soon as the first solution was displayed it went
                                      to the total vector to RENDEZVOUS at that point.
               03:16:15       CC      That's correct. Understand.
               03:19:28       CC      Gemini IX, Houston.
               03:19:32       C       Houston, IX. Go.
               03:19:33       CC      Roger, Tom. I'm sure you've been looking at this.
                                      Our estimate for the time to switch into Rendezvous
                                      Mode is at 15.3 degrees for 3 hours, 20
                                      minutes, 05 seconds.
               03:19:49       C       Roger. Checks pretty close to what we've come
                                      up with. However, we're going to have to put
                                      some addresses in the computer and check them
                                      now.
               03:19:59       CC      Roger. Your darkness time is - your TPI is cur-
                                      rently 5 minutes, about 5-1/2 minutes before sunset.
	Page 38

         03:20:06 C   5-1/2 before sunset.
         03:20:20 CC  Roger. Did you switch into RENDEZVOUS now?
         03:20:25 C   Roger. We switched to the RENDEZVOUS.
         03:20:26 CC  Okay.
         03:21:22 C   Hello, Houston. Gemini IX.
         03:21:27 CC  Roger.
         03:21:30 C   I've got a real faint light out there by the
                      reticles. Too early to tell.
         03:21:35 CC  Good show! Can you tell us what time you went
                      into Rendezvous Mode?
         03:21:37 C   I've got it. I've got it in reflected sunlight
                      now as about a 6-magnitude star.
         03:21:42 CC  Roger. Good.
         03:21:54 C   Houston, Gemini IX. The boresights between the
                      optics and the radar look very good.
         03:22:01 CC  Very good. We're approaching LOS.

         03:27:51 CC  Okay. Tom, it won't hurt you to go ahead and
                      press START COMP after you get your solution.

        03:31:14 CC  Houston. You're a bit garbled, Gene.
        03:31:19 P   7:20; 22 degrees. Okay. The time that I want,
                     Tom, is going to be 9 minutes. Don't let me
                     miss it.
        03:31:24 C   9 minutes. Okay. It's 8:17.
        03:32:10 C   8:55, 6, 7, 8, 9 minutes. Right on the dude.
        03:32:19 P   26, that's Point C. There's Point C and there's
                     our solution. 26 forward, 4 right and 9 up.
        03:32:24 C   Okay. And at least we finished.
        03:32:29 P   What is it?
        03:32:31 C   26 forward, 4 right and 9 up.
        03:32:39 P   26 forward - -
        03:32:43 C   4 right and 9 up.
        03:32:47 P   - - 4 right and 9 up.They gave us 26.7 and a
                     1.3 up. Go - go ahead, push START COMP. That
                     was Point C.
        03:32:53 C   I can't get a light.
        03:32:57 P   Go ahead....we broke ...
        03:33:00 P   Okay. I need a good point at 10:40, Tom.
        03:33:07 C   Houston, Gemini IX. We've got the solution
                     worked out real good with Point C, but when I
                     pushed START COMP no light comes on. We'll
                     stand by for the light and see if we get it.

                        The Closed Loop is 26 forward, 3 right and 8 up.
           03:33:24 P   Okay. At 10:40 I need a big point, Tom.
           03:33:26 C   10:40. Okay.I'll be right on it.
           03:33:31 P   Did you push START COMP?
           03:33:32 C   Yes. Pushing - -
           03:33:36 CC  Houston. Copy 26 forward, 3 right and 8 up.
           03:33:39 C   - - Roger.
           03:33:46 C   You want 10:40, right?
           03:33:49 P   Yes.
           03:33:51 C   All right.
           03:33:53 P   We there?
           03:33:56 P   Mark it right there and we're on it! Point D.
           03:34:00 P   25.2, 27.96. Okay. 115, 28, 24 forward, 24
                        forward and - -
           03:34:03 CC  ...
           03:34:48 P   - - 0 up/down.
           03:34:53 P   Okay. You get 8 there and the Ground gave us
                        1.3 up and I get 0.
           03:34:54 C   Give them our backup real quick.
           03:34:55 P   Houston, Gemini IX. Point D is elevation 25.2,
                        range 27.96, 115 Range-Rate. Backup solution
                        gives 24 forward, O up/down.
           03:35:00 CC  Roger.
           03:35:13 P   Okay. Do you want to go to - go with the - -
           03:35:17 C   Let's go with yours.
           03:35:18 P   - - 24 forward, 0 up/down.
	Page 41

        03:35:25 P    The Ground gets 1.3 up and Closed Loop goes 8 up.
        03:35:31 C    Let's take the 1 up. Okay? Let's take 27 forward.
                      Okay?
        03:35:33 P    That's - that's backup?
        03:35:34 C    Yes. 27 forward and 1 up. Okay?
        03:35:39 P    Okay.
        03:35:43 P    Just in case you can't crank that in, there's - -
        03:35:44 C    How much right?
        03:35:46 P    They said 2.2.
        03:35:48 C    Right?
        03:35:50 P    Yes.
        03:35:52 C    START COMP. We're burning.
        03:35:54 P   What time is it? 12 - -
        03:35:56 C    12:50. Is that on time?
        03:35:57 P    Exactly on time.
        03:36:00 C   We're burning. Gemini IX's burning.
        03:36:04 P    Closed Loop may be - you went 27 forward, 1 up
                     and how many right?
        03:36:10 C    2 right.
        03:36:14 P    2 right. You're burning it, right?
        03:36:16 C   One.
        03:36:39 C   MARK.
        03:36:43 P   Okay. We'll get our clocks started at 13:30.
                     Looks like you initiated fairly well on the
                     angle, Tom.
	Page 42

           03:36:46 C   Okay.
           03:36:51 P   Here, let me get 25, 6 and 7 in 0 if I can. That
                        right here?
           03:36:58 C   No, not yet. Not yet. Don't do anything with
                        it.
           03:37:00 P   Okay.You can set your clock to 1 minute.
           03:37:03 C   Okay. It's coming down to 1 minute.
           03:37:08 C    ... functions ...
           03:37:10 P   27 forward, 1 up and 1 right. Affirm?
           03:37:13 C   Yes.
           03:37:15 C   1 minute. Now if we can see in this thing we
                        can only get 1 minute.
           03:37:22 P   Okay. 15 seconds. Hey! see it.
           03:37:24 C   Oh yes! It's out there, man. It's really out
                        there!
           03:37:25 P   Boy, I hope that's not the shroud ...
           03:37:26 P   Okay. Coming up on 1 minute. Ready? Start your
                        clock.
           03:37:27 P   Mark it.
           03:37:33 C   Marked it.
           03:37:43 C   Did you time my burn by any chance?
           03:37:55 P   No, Tom, I didn't. I was starting to and we hit
                        it so fast then.
           03:38:05 P   Houston, Gemini IX. Is that 29.9, 23.31 miles?
                        Range-Rate is 142.
           03:38:46 C  There! It's working.
           03:38:51 P   What is?

	Page 43

        03:38:54 C   Closed Loop. It snapped off.
        03:38:58 P   Okay. Let's go to - I want an angle and a Range-Rate
                     of 225.
        03:38:59 C   It's still in my reflected sunlight.
        03:39:01 P   Ready.
        03:39:03 P   Mark it.
        03:39:04 C   Stand by.
        03:39:05 P   We've got it right on.
        03:39:22 P   We may have to go up on this one, Tom.
        03:39:29 C   This Closed Loop has been pretty good.
        03:40:49 P   Loop is cranking.
        03:40:53 C   Yes, you can see it out there. We're getting
                     dark. It's still in reflected sunlight. It's
                     going to disappear shortly. It's getting dim.
                     It's getting very dim. And I have the flashing
                     lights.
        03:41:15 P    You have them?
        03:41:17 C    Houston, Gemini IX. I've got the ACQ lights.
        03:41:22 P    I've got them too. I see them. Oh great, Tom!
                      4.9. We're going to have a little UP correction
                      on this one, but --
        03:41:24 C    Ail right. We're in business.
        03:41:27 P    And we're cranking, by the way.
        03:41:31  P   Let's see, 4.9 - 4.9 and 35.
        03:41:36 C    I don't have them.
        03:41:39  P   I had them though.
        03:41:41  C   Yes, I did earlier.

	Page 44

         03:41:42 P   ...
         03:41:43 C   The ACQ lights have disappeared again.
         03:41:47 P   Three of them.
         03:41:55 C   Three of them, right?
         03:42:00 P   Three or four of them.
         03:42:05 C   Well, I've lost them. Still tracking the radar.
         03:42:10 P   2 aft and 3 up. Okay?
         03:42:14 C   Yes! Now I've completely lost them, Gene.
         03:42:19 P   Maybe roll a little bit. They were on though,
                      Tom, I saw them.
         03:42:21 C   Yes.
         03:42:23 P   Saw them blinking.
         03:42:24 C   There they are!
         03:42:26 P   Yes, there they are.
         03:42:27 C   There they are again!
         03:42:28 P   Okay. 7 minutes. We're going to have a slight
                      UP correction, Tom.
         03:42:30 C   Good?
         03:42:34 P   What time do you have?
         03:42:36 C   Okay. 5:56.
         03:42:39 P   Okay. We've got another minute to go ...
         03:42:41 C   ... just a faint little ...
         03:42:44 P   34.8 ... 34.8

        03:42:48 C   Hello, RKV, Gemini IX.
        03:44:20 CC  Gemini IX. Houston standing by.
        03:44:38 CC  Gemini IX. Houston standing by.
        03:44:42 P   Roger. This is Gemini IX at 7 minutes, elevation,
                     5.69.
        03:50:14 P   Elevation, 54.3; range, 9.35; Range-Rate, 89 feet
                     per second.
        03:50:21 CC  Roger. We're less than a minute from LOS.
        03:53:34 C   Okay. The burn is at 16:40 after transfer 5
                     degrees right in the reticle and still see the
                     flashing light.
        03:53:50 C   1 up, 1 aft, 20. Okay. 7 miles and 63.3.
        03:53:53 P   19 minutes, Tom.
        03:54:12 P   Okay. Here's our plot coming right in here.
                     Okay? Okay. What are we coming up on now,
                     anything much?
        03:54:24 C   17:40.
        03:54:25 P   Okay.
        03:54:29 P   Boy, I feel bent over like a pretzel!
        03:54:34 C   There are no stars out there either.
        03:54:38 P   No, that moon is just blinding. You don't have
                    any of them (stars) period!
       03:54:41 P   Sure glad there are flashing lights.
       03:54:43 C   I've got some running lights on him.
       03:54:47 P   I've lost him entirely now.
       03:54:53 C   What's that?
	Page 46

           03:54:55 P    Hey, that is Scorpio. The head of Scorpio behind
                         the moon.
           03:54:59 C    Yes.
           03:55:02 P    And Antares.
           03:55:05 P    I've never seen anything so bright as that moon.
           03:55:07 C    Yes, it's blinding me.
           03:55:13 P   I don't have him at all now.
           03:55:16 C    I don't either. I'm tracking him on radar. The
                         needles are - -
           03:55:19 P   Okay. 19 minutes. Radar looks pretty good.
           03:55:24 C   - - Sure does. Lots better than what we've
                        been getting.
           03:55:34 P   What did we do with the ... by the way?
           03:55:36 C   I've got it.
           03:55:37 P   Okay.
           03:55:38 P   Okay. Ready?
           03:55:40 P   Mark it.
           03:55:42 C   I've got him again.
           03:55:43 P   How's the angle?
           03:55:44 C   Now. I hit it. I'm right on him.
           03:55:48 P   7 seconds late, but we'll take it.
           03:55:50 C   7 seconds late only.
           03:55:53 P   7 seconds. 72.5, 5.13 miles, Range-Rate is 55
                        feet per second. Looks fairly good, Tom. Matter
                        fact, this is looking real good. 72.5, 5.13.
                        Coming right in here.
	Page 47

        03:56:38 C   Good show. We have to get in there somehow,
                     Gene.
        03:56:41 P   How about a planet, or can you tell it?
        03:56:43 C   I can't really tell it yet, little bit of bias -
                     maybe when I rolled to the right I goofed this
                     up, but I think the Closed Loop will probably
                     take us back in.
        03:56:46 P   I didn't like the Closed Loop transfer, but the
                     correction seemed to be all right.
        03:56:53 C    Yes.
        03:56:55 P    Look at those needles!
        03:57:00 C    ... I don't have any flashing lights either,
                      Gene.
        03:57:04 P    Yes. Just do the best you can and I'll take a
                     reading.
        03:57:08 C    Hit it.
        03:57:10 P    MARK.
        03:57:14 C    Can't tell ...
        03:57:26 P    77.1 degrees, 4.4O miles and 53 feet per second.
        03:57:33 C    I've lost my place.
        03:57:42 P   Okay. I need a critical angle at 22 minutes.
        03:57:53 C   There he is. I can see the red light on him
                     now. The moon is giving him reflected moonlight.
        03:58:00 P   Yes, reflected moonlight is right. It sure is.
                     You can almost see him tumble.
        03:58:01 C   Yes.
        03:58:02 P   Watch the ACQ light go around now.
	Page 48

           03:58:03 C    Yes.
           03:58:05 P   Okay. At 22 minutes I need a 4:40:76.
           03:58:07 C    This is Gemini IX transmitting in the blind. We
                         have him in reflected moonlight at approximately
                         4 miles.
           03:58:17 P   Am I right - I don't expect this correction to
                        be little or nothing, Tom. Okay.
           03:58:19 C   Oh, look at that moonlight!
           03:58:24 P   Reflected moonlight! I can almost see an ACQ
                        light, I think.
           03:58:31 P   Sure can. I see something red. Okay, Tom.
                        Here we go. 19:07. That's all right, 22:07.
                        You ready?
           03:58:43 P   Mark it.
           03:59:00 C   Who have we got this going away to.
           03:59:05 P   The Out-of-Plane that's looking around ...
           03:59:07 C   A little left.
           03:59:10 P   10.8 in 83.
           03:59:14 C   10.8.
           03:59:19 P   See, the trouble is you give me one radar angle
                        and one visual angle and that's what hurts.
           03:59:21 C   Yes.
           03:59:22 P   This says about 3 down.
           03:59:33 C   Well, if we'd have applied that number we'd have
                        really gone down.

                          CARNARVON
        03:59:34 CC  Gemini IX, Carnarvon CAP COM. We're standing by.
        03:59:38 C   Roger. Carnarvon. We've got the ATDA in reflected
                     moonlight at about 3 1/2 miles and it looks like
                     we've got the Out-of-Plane wired and we're coming
                     up the pipe.
        03:59:43 CC  Good show!
        03:59:50 P   04 on aft and 3 down, but I - I'd buy 3 down. One's
                     a radar angle and one's a visual angle.
        03:59:58 C   I think our Out-of-Plane is just about 0.
       04:00:00 P   83. Okay.I'm going to take an angle and give it
                    to them right now.
       04:00:02 P   You on?
       04:00:08 C   Yes. 23, 25. Coming up with the solution.
       04:00:12 P   That burn is going to play heck with us.
       04:00:22 P   Carnarvon, we're at 88.2 degrees and 3 miles.
       04:00:24 C   3 forward and 2 down.
       04:00:25 CC  Roger.
       04:00:26 C   3 forward and 2 down?
       04:00:27 P   Right.
       04:00:28 C   Okay.
       04:00:31 C   MARK.
       04:00:36 P   You don't even need the forward. What'd you put,
                    2 forward or 3?
       04:00:38 C   3. It's right in there, Gene. PULSE okay. Go
                    ahead.
       04:00:42 P   Okay. Let's see if we can zero 25, 6 and 7.
	Page 50

           04:00:44 C   Okay. Going to CATCH-UP.
           04:00:48 P   Carnarvon. We just applied the Closed-Loop solution
                        of 3 forward and 2 down.
           04:00:58 C    Okay. Go ahead now that we're in CATCH-UP, Gene.
                         Hey, the thing isn't.
           04:01:04 P    No it isn't.
           04:01:05 C    Holding steady at 45 feet per second.
           04:01:17 P    Okay. Looks good.
           04:01:22 P    Okay.
           04:01:24 C    Lean it forward just a bit.
           04:01:27 P    I can see the red ACQ lights all right. Okay, Tom,
                         what time do you have? 25?
           04:01:28 C    Yes.
           04:01:31 P    Going to get an angle?
           04:01:33 C    Yes.
           04:01:35 P    Okay. Now get it.
           04:01:43 C    Got it.
           04:01:46 P    Oh!
           04:01:48 C    Carnarvon, Gemini IX. We have the red running
                         lights at this time, 2-1/2 miles.
           04:01:53 CC   Roger.
           04:01:57 C    Oh, we're going to brake right into the moon, Gene.
           04:01:59 P    Yes.
           04:02:05 C    Carnarvon, Gemini IX. It looks like we're going to
                         be braking directly into the moon and it should be
                         an interesting problem.
           04:02:06 CC   Roger.

       04:02:12 P   Gemini IX. Elevation 94.9, range 2.37 miles, 39
                    feet per second.
       04:02:22 P   Coming up right under, Tom. Here's your last
                    point.
       04:02:25 C   Good show, Gene.
       04:02:29 P   Okay. I want to get on LOS here, Tom, at about
                    5 minutes after - 5 seconds after.
       04:02:36 P   Don't use the moon for inertial reference.
       04:02:41 C   (Laughter) Okay.
       04:02:43 P   Okay. You ready?
       04:02:44 P   Mark it.
       04:02:51 C   Go, Gene.
       04:02:58 P   Too fast. Way too fast, Tom. 2 miles.
       04:03:02 P   Carnarvon, Gemini IX. Elevation 99.0 degrees, 2
                    miles, 37 feet per second.
       04:03:10 P   Okay, Tom. Let me take another one on this, but
                    that was 4 - no, that's about right, I'm sorry,
                    that's exactly right. 4.1 degrees in a minute.
                    Let's try it again.
       04:03:20 C   I'm right on it. Now you can see it tumble.
       04:03:22 P   Right here. Here we go. You can see it tumble
                    because of the ACQ light.
       04:03:23 C   The two red ones.
       04:03:24 P   Okay. At 5 seconds aft, I want to see 103 degrees.
       04:03:27 C   Okay. Are you ready?
       04:03:28 P   Mark it.
       04:03:32 C   Got it. I might have been off a tenth.
       04:03:53 P   1.67 miles.
	Page 52

          04:04:02 P   This is Gemini IX. Elevation 102.7, 1.67 miles,
                       and 34 feet per second and we can actually determine
                       that it is tumbling because of the ACQ light
                       and the running light variations.
          04:04:21 CC  Roger.
          04:04:23 P   Okay, Tom. Let's see if we can get another one
                       here at - I want to see about 106.7 to 107. You
                       ready?
          04:04:29 C   Yes.
          04:04:30 P   There goes your radar. Okay?
          04:04:31 C   It's coming in and out.
          04:04:32 P   Stand by.
          04:04:33 P   Mark it.
          04:04:37 P   That's all right. 106.8, Tom. We're null inertially.
          04:04:40 C   Good show, Gene.
          04:04:41 P   Gemini IX is 106.8 degrees, 1.32 miles and 34 feet
                       per second.
          04:05:01 P   Okay, again. I'll take it, Tom, at - Boy, no stars!
          04:05:03 C   No stars at all!
          04:05:36 P   Okay. Let's try and get this one.
          04:05:38 C   I've got one, but - -
          04:05:40 P   Get inertial.
          04:05:42 CC  Gemini IX, Carnarvon. We're 30 seconds to LOS.
          04:05:43 C   Roger. And we've got it wired inertial.
          04:05:47 C   This is Gemini IX at 1 mile. We can determine
                       distance between the running lights.
          04:05:50 CC  Roger.
	Page 53

       04:05:55 P   Point 98.
       04:05:59 C   Should we burn to brake it down some?
       04:06:00 P   Yes, let's go to push START COMP.
       04:06:02 C   I've got a START COMP. Brake her down.
       04:06:04 P   32 feet per second, Tom. You might just as well
                    take it down to 20.
       04:06:10 C   Okay. Stand by. RATE COMMAND to burn.
       04:06:14 P   Houston. Gemini IX at 110.1 degrees; 1 mile; 32
                    feet per second, and we're braking off to 20 feet
                    per second at this time.
       04:06:29 C   Okay. There's 11-back to PULSE.
       04:06:48 P   Okay.  Let's get some LOS, Tom, anytime you can
                    again.
       04:06:49 C   Okay.
       04:06:52 P   Now you have a little star out there on that rascal.
                    Look at him.
       04:06:54 C   Got a little star for you.
       04:06:56 P   Okay. If you've got a little star, I'll give you
                    the ranges here.
       04:06:59 P   Inertially we look pretty good but is anything,
                    maybe we were just - -
       04:07:02 C   I can see the red and green lights now on the ATDA.
       04:07:04 P   - - just a little and we want to keep going down.
       04:07:05 C   Going down.
       04:07:07 P   Go down; I agree.
       04:07:10 P   Go down for 5 seconds.
       04:07:13 P   Stand by. Okay. You got that star behind him?

	Page 54

          04:07:19 C   Yes. I have just one little star.
          04:07:21 P   .64 miles. And you've got about - you should have
                       about 20 feet per second.
          04:07:26 C   I'll look at that.
          04:07:27 P   There's 19 feet per second, Tom.
          04:07:28 C   That's good, Gene.
          04:07:29 C   Okay. Now ... you back, push START COMP.
          04:07:30 C   MARK.
          04:07:31 C   Go.
          04:07:32 P   Okay. You're coming in on half a mile with 19 feet
                       per second. You're still going down a little.
                       Still going down a little. Out-of-Plane looks good.
          04:07:44 C   Maybe a little more to the left.
          04:07:46 P   A little left, maybe. Coming up on a half mile.
                       Just hold your 19 feet per second, Tom. Down and
                       left a little. See, we're following that moon all
                       the way up. That's why it's so bright. Okay.
                       You're at a half mile right now at 19 feet per
                       second.
          04:08:04 C   Up or down ...
          04:08:07 P   You're at 22 feet per second. Look, it's still
                       going down a bit, Tom. It's not tumbling much now.
                       Okay, there's - coming up on 2600 feet. There's
                       2400 feet and 22 feet per second. 2200 feet and
                       22 feet per second. Tom, you might want to take
                       off - -
          04:08:38 C   Let's take off some more.
          04:08:40 P   - - Okay. Push -
          04:08:41 P   Okay. You're good. Press START COMP.
          04:08:42 P   You're coming in at 1800 feet, 22 feet per second.
                       Are you in RATE COMMAND? Okay. 1800 feet. She's
	Page 55

                     still going down, Tom. I think you have it now.
                     Inside 1800 feet.
        04:09:05 C    What have we got?
        04:09:06 P    You've got about 13 - you have 12 feet per second.
                      You've got 11 feet per second and you're at 1500,
                      1400 feet. Okay. You only have 7 feet per second
                      now, Tom, so hold it. You've only got 7 feet per
                      second. And you're at 12 - 1300 feet.
        04:09:28 C    Man, it looks like a Christmas tree out there.
        04:09:33 P    You only have 7 feet per second and you're at -
                      computer's working okay. You're about 1000 feet
                     right now. I wonder if I should try to get any
                     pictures of this.
        04:09:44 C   Yes. Go ahead and try one final sequence.
        04:09:50 P   You're at 1200 feet ...
        04:10:03 C   I think we have the In-Plane, Out-of-Plane wired.
        04:10:04 P   Okay. You're at 7 feet per second ...
        04:10:07 C   ...
        04:10:09 C   Oh, there he is! The whole thing! The whole moose!
                     Look at that, man!
        04:10:10 P   He's not moving either.
        04:10:11 C   He isn't moving at all.
        04:10:12 P   Okay. Tom, you're at 7 feet per second and you're
                     at ... a thousand feet.
        04:10:19 C   Well, maybe I'll knock it down a little more.
        04:10:21 P   7 feet per second right now. You're at 900 feet.
        04:10:25 C   I've got 5 feet per second on the gage.
       04:l0:27  P   Okay.
       04:10:29  P   Coming in at 800 feet. Still at 900 feet right now.

	Page 56

          04:10:34 C   That's a weird looking machine, isn't it?
          04:10:36 P   Doesn't look like it's tumbling. It may be rolling,
                       but - it sure is.
          04:10:42 C   Would you believe that there's a nose cone on that
                       rascal?
          04:10:44 P   I don't know.
          04:10:53 P   I don't know, Tom. The back of the TDA is painted;
                       there can't be a nose cone on it, can there?
          04:10:57 C   I can't tell.
          04:10:59 P   Okay. Come on baby, you're 5 feet per second and
                       you're at 780 feet. Want me to turn the ACQ lights
                       off? Any time you do, let me know.
          04:11:09 C   No, no, let's leave them on.
          04:11:14 C   We still have 60 percent fuel remaining.
          04:11:16 P   Okay. Tom, you're at 660 feet.
          04:11:21 C   Roger. 660 feet.
          04:11:24 P   We're right In-Plane at 2 feet per second on this
                       thing.
          04:11:27 C   I've got about 5.
          04:11:28 P   Okay.
          04:11:34 P   Okay. Your angle is about 130 degrees now, so it's
                       looking good. You're at 600 feet right now. 540
                       feet. Boy, it's going to be nice to see that in
                       daylight - we're looking at the TDA!
          04:11:49 C   Hey, we've got it!
          04:11:50 P   We're looking at the TDA! Sec, - -
          04:11:52 C   Look at that moose!
          04:11:54 P   ... in it.

	Page 57

         04:11:55 C    Look at that moose!
         04:11:56 C    I'm going to knock it down some - -
         04:11:57 P    It's upside down, but we're looking at it!
         04:12:01 P    Back up a few seconds; tape recorder just went out.
         04:12:04 P    Half a "Sec". Will the lights stay on?
         04:12:08 P    Boy, I wish we had a - this was daylight, we could
                       see this thing better, Tom. You're coming in on
                       it. What's your Range-Rate? You're at 360 feet.
         04:12:16 C    Okay. I'll brake it down.
         04:12:19 P    360 feet right now.
         04:12:22 C    Think I've got to stop ...
         04:12:25 P    Can't see which way I'm looking.
         04:12:27 P    We're looking at the bottom because it's not
                       tumbling very fast.
         04:12:35 C    I can't really tell.
         04:12:37 P    You're at 300 feet.
         04:12:40 C    The shroud is half open. The shroud is half open
                       on that thing!
         04:12:43 P    Is it?
         04:12:44 C    It's half open!
         04:12:46 P    It sure is!
         04:12:49 C    The back pin didn't fire.
         04:12:51 P    It's there but it's half open all right - -

	Page 58

          04:12:52 C    - - It didn't fire.
          04:12:54 P    It's like a clamshell. It's like a clamshell, Tom.
          04:13:01 P    Okay. You're 240 feet. Like a clamshell.
          04:13:04 C    Turn on the Dock light. Let's give it a try.
          04:13:09 P    There's the shroud looking right at us.
          04:13:11 C    Hello, Houston. Gemini IX.
          04:13:16 P    Half open. It's half off too, Tom, because the
                        aft lights are visible - well, they didn't come
                        out, but they are both working. Half open, Tom.
                        Look at that thing! You could almost knock it
                        off! I feel certain you could. The band didn't
                        break, I don't think.
          04:13:37 C    What's the range?
          04:13:38 P    Okay. Range is 120 feet right now.
          04:13:42 C    Looks like those have extended.
          04:13:44 P    Look at that thing! Darn it! What a mess! What's
                        hanging from it, too. Okay. It's rolling our way,
                        Tom; there's the dipole extended.
                               HAWAII
          04:25:18 C    Hello, Houston. Gemini IX.
          04:25:20 CC   Gemini IX, Hawaii.
          04:25:21 C    How are you? I've got a weird looking machine
                        here.
          04:25:25 CC   What does it look like?

	Page 59

         04:25:26 C    Okay. Both the clamshells of the nose cones are
                       still on, but they are open wide. The front release
                       has let go, the back closing bolts attached
                       to the ATDA have both fired and it appears that
                       one of the bolts from the band has fired. What's
                       keeping it together is the slip disconnect for a
                       small electrical connector that fires the bolt on
                       the band.
         04:25:54 CC   Roger. Understand.
         04:25:55 C    So the jaws are like an alligator jaw that's open
                       at 25 to 30 degrees. Both the piston springs look
                       like they are fully extended.
         04:26:06 CC   Roger.
         04:26:11 C    Both of the back parts of the nose cone have separated
                       from the ATDA and it looks like it's just held
                       on by some inconceivable force there. Everything
                       looks good.
         04:26:26 CC   Roger. Understand. What types of rates have you
                       got? How bad is it tumbling?
         04:26:33 C    Okay. It's about 3 to 4 degrees per second.
         04:27:37 C    58 percent fuel remaining. We're stationkeeping
                       to keep it out here between 10 and 30 feet from
                       it.
         04:27:38 CC   Roger. Copy.
         04:27:51 C    All the ...
         04:27:54  C   ... here.
         04:27:58  CC  Say again, Gemini IX.
         04:27:59  C   Roger. It appears that the basic rate is in roll.
                       The body axis right now is merely horizontal. Very
                       slight bit of yaw technically inconceivable and the
                       big rates are in roll.
         04:28:11  CC  Roger. Understand. Do you think there's any possibility
                       of breaking the cone or shaking it loose by
                       going through a few Unrigidizing-to-Rigidizing Sequences?
	Page 60

          04:28:21 C   Well, I might give it a try.
          04:28:25 CC  Roger.
          04:28:38 C   Again, did you copy the information that it appears
                       that the back explosive bolts connected to the ATDA
                       have fired? Also, it is very evident that one of
                       the strap bolts has fired, but also there is a
                       small quick-disconnect from the pyros that fired
                       the bolts from the strap. Those are still attached.
          04:28:56 C   And the ATDA is basically open. So the cone is
                       open 3 to 4 inches at the back on both sides. It's
                       gone out in a 30-degree angle and the strap is around
                       it.
          04:29:09 CC  Roger. Understand. Are you in such a position
                       where you could watch the Unrigidizing-to-Rigidizing?
          04:29:15 C   Stand by one.
          04:29:47 CC  Gemini IX, Hawaii.
          04:29:48 C   Hawaii, Gemini IX. I can also see the back two
                       springs, the back small spring, the little 30-pound
                       springs. We're up to about 5 to 10 feet and
                       jockeying it into position here. And the back bolt
                       is definitely fired. I can see the spring. It's
                       got the two shells apart about 2 inches. The two
                       halves are 2 inches - you can see that the ...
                       and the pyros - the cables on the pyros - the front
                       clamshell against the strap has fired. You can see
                       the black smudge marks on it. I'm now about 3 feet
                       from it and those electrical connectors - the quick-disconnect
                       did not connect on either one of them.
          04:30:40 CC  They did not disconnect? Is that right?
          04:30:42 C   - - the band is holding the whole mass together.
                       Stand by one and let me give you a distance on
                       this other one.
          04:30:55 C   Yes, I'm trying to find the cable disconnect. I
                       can't see the cable disconnect. Of course, it
                       would be taut. Okay, the other one. The spring
                       is gone from the back of the other half one and -

	Page 61

                      no, pardon me, it's still there. It's separated
                      from - the back is completely separated 3 to 4
                      inches and I'll give you another good check. Oh,
                      wait. What's holding the whole mass on there is
                      the band. And half the time these pyro disconnects
                      will work.
        04:31:24 CC   Roger. Understand.
        04:31:26 CC   We've got about 3 minutes here until our LOS. We'd
                      like to go through one Rigidizing and Unrigidizing
                      Sequence and have you watch it, if you'll get into
                      position where you could watch it for them.
        04:31:35 C    Stand by one. I don't want to be too close when
                      those things cut loose.
        04:31:40 CC   Roger. Understand.
        04:31:41 C    Okay. Now on the other side, both explosive bolts
                      on the band have fired; the band is held intact by
                      all four of those electrical pyros that fired the
                      bolts. Looks like somebody did not hook up a disconnect
                      cable.
        04:31:54 CC   Roger. Understand.
        04:31:56 C    The disconnects did not disconnect. That's the
                      only thing that's holding the whole mass intact.
        04:32:01 CC   Roger.
        04:32:04 C    Don't Unrigidize here. Could we hack it over the
                      States?
        04:32:07 CC   Roger. I was just going to suggest it. I'm
                      getting too close to LOS.
        04:32:10 C    Yes, and I'm too close to the nose cone, too.
        04:32:12 CC   Roger.
        04:32:18 C    Pass that word on to Houston that all four explosive
                      bolts have fired and it is basically free from the
                      ATDA but just barely held on by those four little
                      pyro wires there.
	Page 62

            04:32:28 CC   Roger.
            04:32:29 C    Those little wires on the strap of the disconnector.
            04:32:34 CC   Roger. Understand.
            04:32:35 C    And we have 58 percent OAMS fuel remaining.
            04:32:37 CC   Roger.
            04:32:42 C    It looks like an angry alligator out here rotating
                          around.
            04:32:46 CC   I can imagine.
            04:32:57 C    Pass the word on to Houston we can stationkeep here
                          quite awhile, and also have a suggestion that we
                          might put out our docking bar and go tap it.
            04:33:01 CC   Roger. Stand by.
            04:33:03 C    Roger.
            04:33:18 CC   Gemini IX, Hawaii.
            04:33:20 C    Go, Hawaii.
            04:33:22 CC   Houston wants to wait and take a look at it and
                          start cycling the Adapter over the States.
            04:33:27 C    We'll get back in the same position. Again pass
                          on to them that all four explosive bolts have
                          fired and it's basically the three of the ...
                          resting on it. ATDA adapter - four little pyro
                          wires on the adapter that are holding the whole
                          thing.
            04:33:42 CC   Okay. We're having LOS.
            04:33:44 C    The springs have just about extended full force.
                                 TEXAS
            04:35:53 CC   Gemini IX, Houston.
            04:35:55 C    Hello, Houston. Gemini IX.
	Page 63

        04:35:57  CC   Reading you loud and clear.
        04:35:59  C    Roger. I'm out here about 20 feet from it and I
                       guess you got the word that all four explosive
                       bolts did fire.The back separation devices have
                       separated from the ATDA, just hanging loosely on
                       it. It's the four small pyro wires that go to the
                       strap bolts that are holding it together. The two -
                       the strap bolts have fired.
        04:36:21  CC   Roger. Understand, and the wire bundle disconnects -
                       can you see anything about those?
        04:36:32  C    No. They're buried in there too much, Nell.I
                       can't see it.
        04:36:36  CC   Roger. Understand.
        04:36:37  C    The clamshells at the adapter are between 4 to 5
                       inches apart. Those little coil springs, one of
                       them is kind of deployed; the other one is still
                       attached. The basic nose cone has detached from
                      the ATDA ring. The only thing holding it together
                       are those four wires that go - that went to the
                      initiation on the explosive bolts of the strap.
        04:36:57  CC  Understand. Can you - you cannot tell whether the
                      disconnects have pulled? Is that correct? The
                      wire bundle disconnects?
        04:37:08  C   That's affirmative. What's holding it together are
                      the four small plugs that should have quick-
                      disconnects on the pyros on the strap. The whole
                      thing is just loosely hanging on there. We're
                      standing by for an Unrigidized Sequencing. If you
                      can give it right now, it would be great.
        04:37:26  CC  Roger. We'll have to wait until we get over Texas.
        04:37:30  C   Okay.
        04:37:33  CC  Oh, wait a minute! It will be about 6 minutes from
                      now when we're over - when we get in Canaveral
                      acquisition.
        04:37:40  C   Okay. We're standing by to get movies when you
                      Unrigidize.
	Page 64

            04:37:49 CC   Okay. I've got a maneuver message for you for a
                          Radial Sep when you're ready to copy.
            04:37:54 C    Roger. Radial Sep. Do you want us to stand by
                          here and talk this thing over for a minute and see
                          if we can't possibly - I'd like to look at the idea
                          of possibly extending the docking bar and going up
                          and tapping it and maybe the whole thing may fall
                          apart.
            04:38:10 CC   Okay. We've got about 23 minutes left to Radial
                          Sep. I'd like to give you that dope first.
            04:38:20 P    Go. Go ahead, Neil.
            04:38:22 CC   Okay. GET B is 04:01:00: Delta-V, 20.0; burn time,
                          35 seconds; pitch it 90 down; Address 25, zeros;
                          Address 26, 90200; 27, zero; forward thrusters; Up
                          Maneuver.
            04:38:55 P    This is Gemini IX. Say Delta-V - and Addresses
                          25, 6 and 7 again, please.
            04:39:03 CC   Roger. 25 is all zeros; 26, 90200; and 27, zero.
                          That Delta-V is 20 feet per second.
            04:39:18 P    Roger. We got it. GET B is 05:01:00: Delta-V,
                          20; 25-second burn time; 25, all zeros; 26 is
                          90200; 27 is zero and forward thrusters, Up.
            04:39:34 CC   Roger ....that perhaps the cables hadn't pulled
                          the disconnects to the wire bundles, in which case
                          we would definitely have to wait until - with the
                          Contingency Plan B - wait until later to look at
                          that. We will go ahead and exercise that ATDA as
                          soon as we get acquisition at the Cape. Your
                          Platform Alinement prior to this SEP will be here
                          about 5 minutes from now, so you've got that much
                          time to see what you like.
            04:40:07 C    Okay. Okay, Neil.From here it looks like it's
                          possible that the wire bundles could have separated
                          but it's real hard to see. Again, has everybody
                          squared away what's holding the thing together?
            04:40:24 CC   Well, I think everybody down here is pretty well
                          convinced by your description of the situation.

	Page 65

         04:40:31 C    Okay. I can't really tell whether - whether this -
                       we have two big umbilicals that go to the ATDA. I
                       can't tell whether those are still attached or not,
                       but it's the four little wires that go into each
                       end of the explosive bolts on the strap that's
                       supposed to have a disconnect on it, and those are
                       all intact. All four explosive bolts are fired
                       so it's just the little disconnect umbilicals on
                       the strap that have not pulled. All four of them
                       are still intact. And all four should have pulled.
         04:41:02 CC   Roger. We're with you, Tom.
         04:41:39 P    Houston, Gemini IX.
         04:41:41 CC   Go ahead.
         04:41:43 CC   This is Houston. Go ahead.
         04:41:45 P    Roger. On the Rendezvous - we initiated with 27
                       forward, 1 up - which was not quite Closed-Loop.
                       The computer then, however, did function properly
                       to give us our proper corrections and it appears
                       that it is working all right on all modes at the
                       present time.
         04:42:08 CC   All right. Houston copied.
         04:42:15 CC   Did you send the L-Band Command, Gene?
         04:42:40 CC   Gemini IX, Houston.
         04:42:44 P    Go ahead, Houston.
         04:42:46 CC   Did you send that L-Band Command?
         04:42:49 P    We did send an L-Band Command. The ACQ lights
                       are off.
         04:42:52  CC  Roger. Understand. And can you tell us the status
                       of your START COMP light when you're in CATCH-UP?
         04:43:07  P   START COMP light is working fine.Everything
                       appears to be normal.
         04:43:16  P   It was just a little anxious to Rendezvous I
                       guess. After we once accepted its solution, things
                       went real well.

	Page 66

            04:43:22 CC   Okay.
            04:43:25 C    And we still have about 57 percent fuel.
            04:43:28 CC   Good.
            04:43:40 C    We'll stay here and get in a good position anytime
                          that - -
            04:43:45 CC   Okay. And then - how long will it take you to get
                          in a position for Platform Aline as soon as this
                          is over?
            04:43:51  C   Not too long.
            04:43:54  CC  Okay. We're going to be running out of - of alinement
                          time here.
            04:44:12  CC  Your ... will probably be in about 5 minutes or so,
                          so we'll have probably a little shorter alinement
                          time. We'll be okay.
            04:44:22  C   Okay. I'm getting into position now.
            04:44:24  CC  Roger.
            04:44:37  C   Neil, have you gotten any reading on my suggestion
                          about extending the docking bar and giving it a
                          tap?
            04:44:43  CC  Well, we're pretty convinced, due to telemetry
                          signals from the cables, that they are still
                          plugged in.
            04:44:51  C   Okay. Well, it's barely - it looks like it's
                          barely - that's right, the big cables may still
                          be there, but once that strap goes, the whole thing
                          should deploy.
            04:45:03  CC  Right. Are you ready to watch for - we're ready
                          to send the commands now.
            04:45:07  C   Okay. Stand by.
            04:45:09  CC  Let us know as soon as you're ready.
            04:45:l0  C   Okay.

	Page 67

        04:45:21  C    Okay.We're right behind it, Neil. Send the
                       command.
        04:45:24  CC   Roger.
        04:45:47  CC   Okay. Rigidizing now.
        04:45:50  C    It's moving - it's moving all around.
        04:45:55  P    When you Rigidized the clamshell, the alligator
                       jaws came closed slightly.
        04:45:59  CC   Roger.
        04:46:32  CC   Okay. Unrigidizing.
        04:46:34  C    The whole mess rotates about 15 degrees on it.
        04:46:36  CC   Okay. That's a pretty good signal then. We'll
                       plan to go ahead with Separation Burn at this
                       point.
        04:46:42  C    Okay, Neil.
        04:46:44  C    I'm in position to start the Aline.
        04:47:04  CC  Okay. You've got about 14 minutes until Separation
                      Burn so - guide your Platform Aline in positioning
                      accordingly.
        04:47:11  C   Roger.
        04:50:03  CC  Gemini IX, Houston. We're going to be evaluating
                      the shroud situation during the EVA preparation
                      period. How does it look as far as being able to
                      make that Separation time?
        04:50:13  C   We're working on it. I think we'll hack it, Neil.
        04:50:16  CC  Okay. Let us know.
        04:50:37  C   Houston, Gemini IX. We've finished Alining the
                      Platform and we're moving around in position.
        04:52:21  C   Hello, Houston. Gemini IX.
        04:52:23  CC  Houston here.
	Page 68

           04:52:25 C   Roger. We're now directly above the ATDA and I'm
                        getting into position for the burn.
           04:52:34 CC  Okay. How did you think your Alinement went?
           04:52:37 C   The needles came out pretty smooth.
           04:52:40 CC  Okay.
                             ROSE KNOT VICTOR
           05:00:15 CC  Gemini IX, RKV CAP COM. We're standing by for
                        your maneuver in approximately 1 minute.
           05:00:22 C   Roger. We're in position.
           05:00:24 CC  Roger.
           05:00:40 P   RKV, Gemini IX. Stand by for a Mark. Commence
                        with the burn.
           05:00:45 CC  Roger.
           05:01:00 P   MARK. The burn.
           05:01:01 CC  Roger.
           05:01:07 CC  You're right on.
           05:01:37 CC  End the burn.
           05:01:45 CC  Gemini IX, RKV.
           05:01:47 C   Stand by.
           05:02:10 C   RKV. Let's make sure we don't have flashing
                        lights now and the L-Band on.
           05:02:15 CC  Say again.
           05:02:23 CC  Gemini IX, RKV. Would you say again, please?
           05:02:25 C   Would you make sure that the ACQ lights are
                        commanded ON?
           05:02:28 CC  Roger. We just turned them ON.
           05:02:43 P   RKV, Gemini IX. All residuals are zero.
           05:02:47 CC  Roger. Very good.
           05:02:49 C   And the fuel remaining is 50 percent.
           05:02:52 CC  Roger.

	Page 69

        05:02:56 CC   This is the Cape. Could you give us an evaluation
                     of the range in which you can see the ACQ
                     lights when you were making initial Rendezvous,
                     and also how effective you thought the ACQ lights
                     were?
        05:03:09 C    Roger. We saw them for the first time right after
                     docking for quite a time. Then we lost them in
                     the sunlight. It was for about 30 miles. It might
                     have been closer. As soon as we went in the darkness
                     we saw them and then we lost them occasionally.
        05:03:27 CC   Okay.
        05:03:29 C    And we saw the cabin-reflected burn light at about
                      5 or 6 miles, and we saw the RED running light at
                      a good 4 to 5 miles.
        05:03:39 CC   Roger.
        05:05:08 C    RKV, Gemini IX. I now have the ACQ lights on the
                      Gemini to outline the history of duration of roll.
        05:05:15 CC   Roger. Very good.
        05:05:17 C    Distance is now about 1 mile.
        05:05:21 CC   Roger.
        05:05:38 CC   Gemini IX, RKV. We'll have LOS in about a minute
                      here.
        05:05:43 C    Roger. RKV.
                          TANANARIVE
        05:20:21 C    Houston, Gemini IX.
        05:20:26 C    Hello, Canary. Gemini IX.
        05:20:31 CC   Gemini IX. Houston is standing by for Tananarive.
        05:20:35 C    Roger, Houston. Gemini IX. We're now about 5
                      miles from Separation and the RED running light
                      comes in very distinguished to give us the ground

	Page 70

                        down below.
           05:20:50 CC   Roger. Understand.
           05:21:12 CC   Gene, the Comm Tech says they were waving and
                         smiling the first pass over.
           05:21:16 C    Okay, Flight.
           05:26:50 CC   Gemini IX, Houston's about 1 minute from LOS.
           05:27:00 C    Roger, Gemini IX. Our objective looks nominal on
                         the data plot.
           05:27:09 CC   Very good.
           05:30:12 C    ... equal period.
           05:30:14 C    RENDEZVOUS now. We can see the RED running lights
                         on the ATDA at 9 miles.
           05:30:21 P    8.55 here, too.
           05:30:23 C    I'd better go up on the line, hadn't I?
           05:30:26 P    No not yet. That's what you're suppose to do.
           05:30:29 P    Oh yes, yes. Wait a minute.
           05:30:33 C    What's up?
           05:30:35 C    30 minutes.
           05:30:40 P    It's 0,0,0 degrees - yes, 30 minutes.
           05:30:45 C    ... the line.
           05:30:50 P    You can go up on the line right now.
           05:30:55 P    Boy. That's visual crossing at 30 minutes, as far
                         as I'm concerned.
           05:30:57 C    Look at that. It just - you could see it cross the
                         horizon. It's just kind of like a gray bulk. See
                         the night airglow?

	Page 71

        05:31:43 C   You want the last one, Gene? You've been working
                     hard.
        05:31:47 P   They're not that good anymore.
        05:31:49 C    (Laughter)
        05:34:09 C   Did you see the monster?
        05:34:11 P   Not yet.
        05:35:02 C   How we doing?
        05:35:07 P    I don't know. We'll have to cross ... reticle in
                     about 45 minutes. We've got to mark it, don't
                     forget.
        05:35:16 C    I'm Just trying to get that 12-degree mark.
        05:35:59 P   The yaw is still stuck.
        05:36:02 C   Okay. Just a minute here.
        05:36:06 C   Well, just a minute, Gene.
        05:36:08 C   Okay. ... left for you.
        05:36:14 C   Do you have that flashing duck out there? I don't
                     have him at all.
        05:36:16 P   Yes, that's enough.
        05:36:20 C   Let me know in a little bit so I can come back and
                     Aline this Platform.
        05:36:35 P    It will be about three or four more minutes. I
                     want to get the 6 and the 12-degree marking and
                     then we want to get their horizons about - that's
                     at 41, and the horizon crosses about 45 on your
                     reticle - zero on your reticle. You've got thunder
                     down there and lightning.
        05:36:50 C   Yes.
        05:37:02 C   The flashing lights just went off.
        05:37:19 P    I wish the flashing light would roll around.

	Page 72

           05:37:35 P   There it is.
           05:37:40 C   Got it?
           05:38:28 C   How are you doing?
           05:38:31 P   Just waiting for 12 degrees to come up.
           05:38:33 P   You probably could - might just as well go ahead
                         and Aline, Tom.
           05:38:36 C    Can you see it?
           05:38:38 P   Yes, I can see it. I don't know - it's pretty
                        tough to see it while you're alining though.
           05:38:44 P    But we're aways yet from it, coming up in about 3
                         or 4 minutes though.
           05:39:14 P    Just like the simulator? Right?
           05:39:20 P    Oh, I Just saw a falling - a star.
           05:39:21 C    Did you?
           05:39:22 P    Yes.
           05:39:26 C    One never knows when you might see a falling star.
           05:39:27 P   We on?
                              COASTAL SENTRY QUEBEC
           05:44:41 CC   Gemini IX, CSQ CAP COM.
           05:44:44 C    CSQ, Gemini IX.
           05:44:46 CC   Roger, Gemini IX. You can start your fuel cell
                         purge at your convenience and advise the next
                         ground station of your results. It does not have
                         to occur over a ground station. Recopy.
           05:45:00 C    Roger, CSQ, on the fuel cell purge. We're just
                         about to the Horizontal-Adjust Maneuver.

	Page 73

            05:45:05    CC      Roger. Understand, and we're standing by.
            05:47:56     C       CSQ, Gemini IX.
            05:47:58     CC      Gemini IX, CSQ CAP COM. GO.
            05:48:01    C       Roger. We have passed the Horizontal-Adjust Maneuver.
                                 We are exactly nominal and our corrections
                                 are zero.
            05:48:09     CC      Roger.

            06:00:27     CC      Gemini IX, Hawaii.
            06:00:28     C       Roger. We're still Alined in our Platform. We're
                                 standing by to roll inverted in approximately  15
                                 minutes.
            06:00:37     CC      Roger. We'll be getting a tape dump from you this
                                 pass.
            06:00:41     C       Say it again.
            06:00:42     CC      We'll be getting a tape dump from you this pass.
            06:00:44    C       Okay.
            06:00:46     C       This one's off the ATDA, isn't it?
            06:00:50     CC      We haven't got any more words on it.
            06:00:53     C       Okay. Well, first we suggest that we give it one
                                 more try to bump it with our docking bar and see
                                 if we can't break it loose.
            06:01:02     CC      Houston has your input.
            06:01:04    P       Okay.
            06:05:45     C       Recording at 1 hour and 4 minutes after separation.

           06:05:49 P   Looking at the target in reflected sunlight. Getting
                       ready for TPI. Setting in 47 degrees on the
                       sextant. The target is in the background of
                        lighted earth and arising clouds and it's almost
                        impossible to keep track of the target. Waiting
                        for the 47 degrees to come up, and the target and
                       horizon are superimposed. You almost have to keep
                       the target in the sky, keep the horizon just above
                        it, and keep inkling up to the angle, but then you
                       have no reading of the angle unless you take the
                        sextant from your eye and actually read it. It's
                        almost impossible to keep track of the target in
                       the background.
           06:06:30 CC  Gemini IX, Hawaii. If you can, I'd like an onboard
                        OAMS Prop Quantity, please.
           06:06:33 P   Roger. Now reading 49 percent.
           06:06:35 CC   Roger.
           06:06:47 P   Tom, I may let you write down some numbers.
           06:06:50 C    Okay. Any time.
           06:06:52 P   Will you be able to?
           06:06:54 C   Sure.
           06:06:57 P    Okay. When I get this sextant, I'm going to - I'm
                        going to - -
           06:07:02 C   Got to be in boresight - -
           06:07:03 P    - - also get - you'll have to boresight - I'll get
                         96, 36 and 35. You can write those down.
           06:07:11 C    Okay. 96 ...
           06:07:44 P    Boy, it's almost impossible to get these, these
                         angles where the horizon - when you've got to get
                        down in the bottom of the Spacecraft, Tom.
           06:07:50 C    Is that right?
           06:07:52 P    Oh, boy! You see the horizon's almost out of view.

	Page 75

                   And I keep floating up to the top of the Spacecraft,
                   I can't stay down here. I've got to stay
                   very low and very close.
       06:08:18 P   Nominally, this 96 should be what? We'll tell how
                    close we are. Here it is right here.
       06:08:26 C   96 should be 31 degrees.
       06:08:35 C   26 - 3.
       06:08:42 P   You see the problem here is I cannot - -
       06:08:45 C   You got ...
       06:08:47 C   Give me a quick 30-eecond fix.
       06:08:49 CC  Gemini IX, Hawaii. We have 30 seconds to LOS.
       06:08:52 C    ...
       06:08:54 P    Is that right - that...
       06:08:56 C    6.32.
       06:08:59 C   You've got 27 degrees, no wonder your Beta isn't ...
       06:09:01 P   Well, the first one we want is - 30.
       06:09:03 C   30 what?
       06:09:06 P    I can't stay down and forward in the Spacecraft
                     and you also can't set in 47 degrees in here very
                     long.
       06:09:38 P    Coming close.
       06:10:14 P    Coming close, Tom.
       06:10:38 P    Atta boy, Tom.
       06:10:39 C    Okay.
       06:10:40 P    Yes. I want you - the main thing is when I say
                     Mark, Mark the time.
       06:10:42 C    Okay.

	Page 76

                  06:10:46     P       Stand by.
                  06:10:48     C       Yes.
                  06:10:49     P       Stand by.
                  06:10:56     P       Mark the time.
                  06:10:57     C       Roger.
                  06:10:58     P       9:55. Write it down.
                  06:11:02     P       Time?
                  06:11:06     C       What is it, 47?
                  06:11:09     P       20.9 degrees.   5.54 miles.
                                                 HOUSTON
                  06:11:13     CC      Gemini IX, Houston standing by.
                  06:11:14     P        Okay.
                  06:11:18     C        Okay.
                  06:11:21     C        Should I write them in the right column here, or...
                  06:11:23     P        That's right.  5.54, 36 feet per second. The main
                                        thing is, did you get the time?
                  06:11:28      C       9:55.
                  06:11:29      P       Okay.  Fine.  And, 26 feet per second on that one.
                  06:11:33      P       Okay.  And on the next one, just write the next
                                        ones in and I'11 make the calculations if I can
                                        see the horizon.
                  06:11:45      P       It's going to be a real touch and go one here because ...
                  06:12:06      C       Shouldn't 30.9 be down at the bottom?   5.45 be here?
                  06:12:19      P       Did I foul up on this?  You still voice setting?
                  06:12:23      C       Yes.
	Page 77

      06:12:25 P   I fouled up, that's all right. I'll get it. I'll
                   make it up. I fouled up. Sorry Tom, I'll get it,
                   I'll get it.
      06:12:33 P   Boresight.
      06:12:35 C   I'm boresighted.
      06:12:37 P   What time is it right now?
      06:12:38 C   11:35.
      06:12:39 P   Okay.
      06:12:40 P   Time?
      06:13:43 CC  Gemini IX, Houston standing by.
      06:13:45 C   Roger. We're approaching terminal phase of this ...
      06:17:36 CC  Gemini IX, if you have time, confirm that you have
                    sent the L-Band Command.
      06:17:44  C   What? That we have sent the L-Band Command, Neil?
      06:17:50 CC  Roger. Confirm.
      06:17:52 C    Roger. Over. We have a solid lock-on here. Neil,
                   we have been in reflected sunlight ever since we
                   turned over upside down starting up. We just completed
                    TPI.
      06:18:04 CC   Roger. We're with you.
      06:18:06 C    Okay. And everything's looking good.
      06:19:06 CC   Good. Houston. We understand that you have turned
                    the ACQ lights OFF. Is that correct?
      06:19:12 C    Negative. We have not turned the ACQ lights OFF.
      06:19:14 CC   Okay. We're running pretty "scotch" on power on
                    this thing, so I'd like to have you turn them off
                   when you can.
      06:19:22 P    Roger. We'll turn them off right now, Neil.

	Page 78

          06:19:25 CC   Okay.
          06:19:29 P    M.A.P. verified.
           06:20:30 CC  Okay.
           06:20:41 P   Houston, Gemini IX. Our pitch angle is now about
                        54 degrees.
           06:20:46 CC  Houston. Roger.
           06:21:06 C   Okay. One hour and 20 minutes from initiation.
                        Pitch angle is about 56 degrees down, taking sextant
                        sighting.
           06:21:18 P   Checking corrections.
           06:21:30 P   I'm going to get an angle to the sun's edges.
           06:21:49 P   Okay. We got it?
           06:21:52 C   Yes. She is boresighted.
           06:22:11 P   27 feet per second. You've got the times? ...
                        zero. 80 degrees, 80 degrees and about 2 minutes.
                         ... might be able to recover, Tom.
           06:22:30 P   55:22.
           06:22:33 C   Oh, look at that ...
           06:22:35 P   Right here. Caught you back on a curve.
           06:22:40 C   Good show!
           06:22:42 P   I hope we're not overshooting it.
           06:22:45 P   Okay, Tom. In about another minute we should be
                        coming up about 64 degrees. I wanted to get a
                        good sextant sighting for Chuck because he wants
                        this badly.
           06:22:59 C   What do you think of the sextant there?
           06:23:03 P   Well, it's all right but you've got such limited
                        space to work with. It's got limitations more at

	Page 79

                   night than it does during the day. If I could
                   just make sure I get the horizon on this next one.
                   You see, I'm forced way down in the corner of this
                   thing and I can barely see the horizon, and like
                   this one - I don't know if we'll get this one or
                   not, Tom.
      06:23:30 P    If we do, it will be by the hair of our chinny
                    chin chin!
      06:23:37 C    Okay. Second correction is two seconds down.
                    Stand by. I'll get it here.
      06:27:00 C    MARK.
      06:27:01 P    Okay. Let's go into LOS real quick.
      06:27:04 C    Going into LOS.
      06:27:06 P    Okay. And we're inside and let me get our - -
      06:27:09 C   We should sit here at zero, you might check that.
      06:27:11 P    - - .91 miles. Okay, and we've got 19 feet per
                    second and we're ready to check LOS at any time.
      06:27:21 C    Okay. I'm on him.
      06:27:22 P    Got him.
      06:27:24 P    Mark it. You're on him. You're accurate enough
                    for LOS?
      06:27:28 C    Yes.
      06:27:29 P    Okay.
      06:27:30 P    67.9.
      06:27:44 P    Okay. You're at 0.8 of a mile and you're about 19
                    feet per second coming up on another LOS.
      06:27:52 P    Are you ready?
      06:27:54 C    Yes.
      06:27:55 P   Mark it.
	Page 80

           06:27:56 C    Yes.
           06:27:59 P    67.9. That means it's zero, Tom. On a zero, that
                         means you want to go up. Let me just check this
                         in 30 seconds. 67.9. That means you're here and
                         you're at 0.7 of a mile. That means you're on and
                         probably want to go up. Okay.
           06:28:18 C    On it.
           06:28:19 P    Stand by in 5 seconds.
           06:28:23 P    Mark it.
           06:28:24 C    Got it.
           06:28:30 P    Okay. Go up the angles - -
           06:28:32 C    Okay. How much?
           06:28:33 P    - - Okay. 7 seconds up.
           06:28:37 C    32 to 39.
           06:28:40 P    Stand by.
           06:28:42 P    Mark it. Okay. Your range - that last lock correction
                         was no good. Bad correction. Okay.
                         Coming in at 1/2 mile, Tom. We've got to check
                         LOS all the way because you have no stars.
           06:28:52 C    Yes. It's really starting to grow out there.
           06:28:57 P    Okay. You're 19 feet per second. How about LOS?
           06:29:01 C    Good enough. Shoot it.
           06:29:03 P    Okay. Right now.
           06:29:07 C    Another half a mile you can really see him go out
                         there to brake it. Optically, you can easily judge
                         the half mile.
           06:29:13 P    3.9 to brake.
           06:29:16 C    Okay. I'd better start knocking it down before
                         too long.
	Page 81

      06:29:19 P    Okay. You're inside a half mile. You've got about
                    19 feet per second, Tom, and thrust up, up, up.
                    Keep going up and let me check range.
      06:29:33 P    Okay. You're inside a half a mile. Better start
                    braking.
      06:29:37 C    Okay. Braking it down.
      06:29:39 P    You thrusted up 10 seconds, that was good. You
                    got 19 feet per second.
      06:29:42 P    And - I'll probably pull off nine of it.
      06:29:49 P    If I keep going around that - -
      06:29:52 C    We're right in-plane.
      06:29:53 P    - - Okay. But you've still got to go up.
      06:29:59 C    I can see the angry claws right now.
      06:30:00 P    You still have to go up.
      06:30:05 P    Okay. You're 2,000 feet. Okay. Hold it Tom.
                    What do you have on there? You've got about 11
                    feet per second.
      06:30:11 C    Okay.
      06:30:13 P    You're at 2,000 feet.
      06:30:18 C    Got to go up.
      06:30:20 P    11 feet per second and 2,000 feet.
      06:30:23 C    You can really ... easy to brake.
      06:30:24 P    Okay.
      06:30:27 C    Right In-Plane.
      06:30:30 P    Okay, but you're 1800 feet. Keep that ball going
                    around and you're at 7 feet per second. Real good
                    shape: 18OO feet, 7 feet per second.
      06:30:44 C    Okay, I'll--
	Page 82

          06:30:46 P    Watch his - watch this ball now.
          06:30:47 P    - - Optically, I can see him grow. There is no
                        trouble about seeing him grow.
          06:30:54 C    I wonder if we knocked that Range-Rate down too
                        low.
          06:30:57 P    7 feet per second.
          06:30:59 P    Okay. Thrust up for 5 seconds, Tom.
          06:31:01 C    Okay. Up. I can see the shroud of the ATDA.
          06:31:04 P    All right.
          06:31:07 P    Mark it.
          06:31:09 C    Okay.
          06:31:13 C    Coming in.
          06:31:17 P    1500 feet.
          06:31:23 C    Oh, look at it! Beautiful!
          06:31:25 P    7 feet per second.
          06:31:29 C    You can tell you're growing. Just no trouble at
                        all telling you're growing.
          06:31:33 P    That last sextant's reading was down in the bottom
                        of the corner; it was almost impossible, and that's
                        what happened on that one. Okay, Tom, you're at -
                        14OO feet. You've got a good Range-Rate, 7 feet
                        per second. You're coming right under him. Your
                        angle's very slowly going up - going - you could
                        probably thrust up for another 2 seconds. Mark it.
                        Stand by.
          06:32:00 P    Mark it.
          06:32:01 C    I don't want to use too much more fuel here.
          06:32:02 P    Okay.
          06:32:07 P    You've got 7 feet per second and you're probably
	Page 83

                   coming in at 1200 feet.
      06:32:13 P   Okay. You're inside of 1200 feet.
      06:32:18 P   Boy. I really screwed up on that one, Tom. I'm
                   sorry.
      06:32:23 P   We had a good transfer through and good second
                    correction. The third correction is what hurt us.
      06:32:30 C    I'd estimate we're about 1000 feet, optically.
      06:32:33 P   Okay. We're 1000 feet exactly.
      06:32:34 C    ...
      06:32:35 P   960 feet.
      06:32:37 C    I can see it in the reticles.
      06:32:38 P   Okay. She's moving around the ball. You're moving
                   in 90 degrees. You're in good shape. You've got
                   7 feet per second, 7 feet per second. Okay. You're
                    at 800 feet.
      06:32:59 P   780 feet, Tom, 7 feet per second.
      06:33:09 C   Okay. Run some off.
      06:33:16 P    660 feet.
      06:33:18 C   Hey, you can see us growing pretty good. There,
                    I'll knock a little bit off.
      06:33:21 P   7 feet per second at 660 feet, and you're going
                    around the ball to 90 degrees.
      06:33:37 P    540 feet.
      06:33:42 P   You've got about 2 to 3-feet-per-second, Tom.
      06:33:47 C   That's just what I want.
      06:33:51 C   Hello, Houston. Gemini IX.
      06:33:54 P   Okay. You're going around to 90 degrees. In real
                   good shape, Tom, and you've got 420 feet.

           06:34:01 C    Hello Houston, Gemini IX.
           06:34:08 C    Oh, look at that son-of-a-gun do it.
           06:34:10 P    Okay. You're coming right up under it at 90 degrees.
                         You've got 5-feet-per-second closing.
           06:34:18 P    You're at 360 feet.
           06:34:24 C    Yes. You can see just the length of it out there -
                         outline of it.
           06:34:29 P    Look at that banana claw there.
                              ROSE KNOT VICTOR
           06:34:36 CC   Gemini IX, RKV CAP COM will be standing by until
                         you stabilize and start stationkeeping.
           06:34:38 C    Roger, RKV.
           06:34:40 P   Check your Range-Rate.
           06:34:43 C    RKV, Gemini IX. We're there.
           06:34:45 P    360 feet.
           06:34:47 C   We broke optically and I'd estimate we're about
                         200 feet just slowly closing in.
           06:34:51 P    2 feet per second. You're in good shape. And,
                        we're coming around. We'll be heads up, we'll keep
                         coming this way, Tom.
           06:35:09 P    Barely closing. Still at 360.
           06:35:10 C    ...
           06:35:14 P    See those claws look at you. Boy, your window is
                         filthy. I can see from here.
           06:35:25 C    Yes.
           06:35:27 P    It's 300 feet, Tom.
	Page 85

      06:35:42 P   2-feet-per-second closing, 300 feet.
      06:35:54 P   240 feet.
      06:36:05 C    I've got 42 percent fuel.
      06:36:10 P   Yes. I should have done better on that one.
      06:36:14 P   If I had ignored that third correction that I used
                   with that last sextant reading, we would have -
                   we would have probably come right on in, - and it's
                   nighttime.
      06:36:27 P   Hello. This is Gemini IX transmitting in the blind.
                  How do you read?
      06:36:30 CC  Gemini IX, this is RKV. Reading you loud and clear.
      06:36:32 C   Okay. We have completed the optical rendezvous and
                   are stationkeeping about 1OO feet from the ATDA and
                   closing in.
      06:36:40 CC Roger.
      06:36:45 C   I have 42 percent fuel remaining.
      06:36:47 CC  Roger. Understand. 42 percent.
      06:36:49 C   Roger.
      06:36:51 CC  Roger. I have some information for you when you're
                   ready to copy.
      06:36:53 C   Wait till we get a fuel cell purge here.
      06:37:03 P   Wow! That sunlight!
      06:37:06 C   Can you see him now?
      06:37:09 P   Yes. He's right in front of me. I can't tell much
                   about him, though.
      06:37:12 C   Okay.
      06:37:13 P   We're drifting up. If you yaw to the right a little
                   bit you'll have him.
	Page 86

           06:37:33 P    This is Gemini IX. Go ahead with your update, RKV.
           06:37:35 CC   Roger. First, I have some information for you.
                         The people at the Cape and Houston do not believe
                         we can get the shroud separated.
           06:37:47 C   Okay.
           06:37:48 CC   - - and so we'll go on with the Sep Maneuver and
                         want to advise you to use minimum OAMS during your
                         stationkeeping period. If you have on-board readings
                         of 40 percent, we'll have enough to - for the
                         rest of the Flight Plan.
           06:38:04 C    Roger. We have ...
           06:38:05 P    ... to the right. Watch it, Tom, I can't see him,
                         he's in the sun.
           06:38:08 CC   Okay. If you're ready to copy I have your Sep
                         Maneuver.
           06:38:10 C    Okay. Watch it.
           06:38:11 P    Stand by one.
           06:38:12 CC   Standing by here.
           06:38:18 P    I can't even tell - see how close we are, Tom.
                         Yaw to the right. I can't see it - oh, I guess
                         we're - -
           06:38:23 C    I've got him. I've got him.
           06:38:24 P    - - I can't even - -
           06:38:29 C    Okay. He's coming over to your side.
           06:38:30 P    - - Okay.
           06:38:33 C    Okay. Go ahead with your message now.
           06:38:34 CC   Roger. This is your Sep Maneuver. GET B: 07:14:58;
                         Delta-V, 3.7; burn time, 6 seconds; yaw 0, pitch 0;
                         Address 25, 90037; Address 26, all zeros; Address
                         27, all zeros; thrusters forward; Maneuver Retrograde.
                         Over.

	Page 87

      06:39:13 P   Remind me of the BEF, too.
      06:39:16 CC  Over.
      06:39:17 P   Roger. Understand. Stand by one.
      06:39:23 C   I've got him.
      06:39:27 P   That's a good boy, Tom.
      06:39:28 P   This is Gemini IX. I am in the process of purging
                   O<sub>2</sub> on Section 2 at this time and the Sep Maneuver
                   is GET B: 07:14:58; Delta-V, 3.7; Delta-2 is 6
                   seconds; yaw 0, pitch 0; 25 is 90037; 26 and 27,
                   all zeros; forward thrusters; Retrograde.
      06:39:55 CC  That's of - Roger.
      06:40:13 C   RKV. We could turn the ACQ off - the running light
                   off, if you want.
      06:40:21 CC  Roger, IX. Want to advise you to start that maneuver
                   behind the ATDA.
      06:40:27 C   Roger. We are in a BEF attitude now. We will
                   Aline BEF.
      06:40:31 CC Roger.
      06:42:28 CC  Gemini IX, RKV. Like to have you turn the L-Band
                   radar off and turn it on prior to the Sep Maneuver.
      06:42:38 C   L-Band coming off.
      06:42:42 CC  Reason for that is it's getting a little bit warm.
                   We've got about 30 seconds till LOS and we'll be
                   standing by.
      06:42:47 C   Roger. We're Alining Platform BEF and we'll make
                   the Retrograde from that one.
      06:42:51 CC Roger.
      06:46:10 C   Okay. To continue on the debriefing on the Optical
                   Rendezvous, it was very easy to see the size of the
                   ATDA, with the nose cone grow at 1 mile. The angle
                   subtended in the optical reticle was very good.

	Page 88

                                               Suggest the most practical way of determining the
                                               pitch angle is to boresight continually and get
                                               pitch off the ball or out of the computer, instead
                                               of using the sextant for the initiation of Q. And
                                               it was very easy to ascertain when approximately
                                               1/2 mile angle. We did not brake until we reached
                                               approximately 2000 feet, at which time we could see
                                               the angle that the ATDA subtended in the reticle.
                      06:47:01        C        It was very easy to see the ATDA grow all the way
                                               through the complete maneuver.

                      06:56:02        CC       Gemini IX, Houston. Standing by for your fuel cell
                                               purge report.
                      06:56:41        CC       Gemini IX, Houston.
                      06:57:23        CC       Gemini IX, Houston.
                      06:57:26        C        Houston, Gemini IX.
                      06:57:28        CC       Roger. How'd the purge go?
                      06:57:31        C        Say again.
                      06:57:32        CC       How'd your fuel cell purge go?
                      06:57:35        C        Real good.
                      06:57:37        CC        Okay. Listen, what's the maximum range you think
                                               you were able to see the ACQ lights at night?
                      06:57:45        C         Right after TPI we saw the ACQ lights.
                      06:57:49        CC        Roger. Right after TPI.
                      06:57:54        C         Roger. Then they faded out as the vehicle rotated.
                      06:58:01        CC        I understand that it faded out. What do you think
                                                the maximum range was there?
                      06:58:12        C         ... estimate it.
	Page 89

      06:58:22 CC   Something like 25 miles, right?
      06:58:35 C   We'll estimate we saw it just as soon it passed ...
                    around 25 miles.
      06:58:41 CC   Roger. I understand.
      06:58:47 CC   How's that alligator?
      07:14:49 C    Okay. Separation burn at 7:14:58. Standing by for
                    3.7-feet-per-second burn.
      07:14:54 P    53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 0, burn.
      07:15:03 C    Counting down 3, 2, 1-
      07:15:04 C    Mark it.
      07:15:10 C    Okay. Hit 82. I'll get the other one.
      07:15:12 P    Yes.
      07:15:15 P    I just want to see because we're looking for 37,
                    actually ...
      07:15:20 C    That's good. 82 is 0, 81 - is 2/10ths of a foot
                    per second.
      07:15:30 P    Okay. I can get it - -
      07:15:32 C    Okay. Give it a blip right.
      07:15:33 P    - - Okay.
      07:15:37 P    Oh, way too much on it.
      07:15:39 C&P  Zero.
      07:15:40 C    80.
      07:15:41 P    About 2.
      07:16:00 C    Go ahead and pull the thing aft.
      07:16:01 P    Proceeding aft.
      07:16:02 C    Hold it. - Okay. That's recycling.

                   07:17:44     C       Yes.  I wonder where we are over the world.
                   07:17:49      P       Yes.  Feel like getting this UCD off before it explodes.
                   07:17:54      C       Yes.  Let's - go at this one at a time.
                   07:17:56      P       Roger.  One at a time.
                   07:17:58      C       Yes.
                   07:17:59      P       ... stand by.

       07:18:59 C   Power Control switches are ON.
       07:19:01 CC  They are ON. Understand.
       07:19:12 C   Okay. I have the ...
       07:19:20 CC  Your CRYO Quantity read ...
       07:19:48 CC  Would you place your CRYO Quantity read to FUEL
                    CELL O<sub>2</sub>?
       07:21:06 C   CSQ, Gemini IX. We would like to power-down ...
                    Platform. We have already got our computer OFF.
       07:21:12 CC  Roger. Stand by one.
       07:21:21 CC  We'd like you to change your radar ... ten minutes
                    after your maneuver, and if you're satisfied, turn
                    your radar off until the next ... and power-down
                    ... before proceeding with your power-down.
       07:21:51 C   Roger. We've already done that.
       07:21:53 CC  Roger. Would you give me an OAMS Prop readout
                    please?
       07:21:56 C   ...
       07:22:03 CC  Roger. Understand.
       07:22:12 CC  We have nothing further for you at this time,
                    Gemini IX. Standing by.
      07:24:26 CC   Gemini IX, CSQ CAP COM.
      07:24:28 C    CSQ, go ahead.
      07:24:30 CC   We have a Flight Plan update for you.
      07:24:32 C    Roger. Stand by.
      07:24:51 C    Gemini IX, go ahead.
      07:24:52 CC   Roger at Hawaii. Time: 07:37:00; crew status
                    report.
	Page 92

            07:25:07 CC  Sleep period from 08:00:00 to 09:00:00. At CSQ:
                         Time, 08:54:00; PLA update; fuel cell purge and
                         CRYO Quantity readout. Sleep period from 09:00:00
                         to 17:00:00. Did you copy?
            07:26:00 C   Roger. We have a crew status report at Hawaii at
                         07:37:00, and a sleep period from 08:00:00 to
                         09:00:00, CSQ, and we'll pick you up at 08:54 to
                          PLA update; fuel cell purge, CRYO Quantity switch
                         readout; sleep period from 09:00:00 to 17:00:00.
            07:26:30 CC  That's affirmative. We have nothing further for
                         you, Gemini IX.
            07:26:34 C   Roger. ...
            07:26:40 CC   And we're showing you GO as you go by.
            07:26:44 C    Roger.
                               HAWAII
            07:38:00 CC   Gemini IX, Hawaii.
            07:38:02 C    Hawaii, IX here.
            07:38:04 CC   Roger. How's it going?
            07:38:06 C    Real good. We're powering-down now and we've
                          completed the Optical Rendezvous real good - right
                          on schedule, and there's no trouble at all braking
                          optically and it fell in sight just like we planned
                          it would. Right now we're powered-down and are
                          getting squared away to start the eat period.
            07:38:27 CC   Roger. Understand. We expected to see a thermometer
                          in somebody's mouth at this time.
            07:38:38 C   We'll give you one.
            07:38:40 CC   Okay. Have you got your Control Power switch OPEN
                          on OAMS?
            07:38:46 C    Control Power is CLOSED. Control Power is OFF.

	Page 93

      07:38:50 CC   Roger. Understand.
      07:38:54 P    If you knew what we were doing you wouldn't have
                    expected to see that thermometer.
      07:38:57 CC   Roger. Understand.
      07:39:28 CC   Gemini IX, Hawaii.
      07:39:29 C    Go ahead, Hawaii.
      07:39:32 CC   During your power-down, did you stay in PRELAUNCH
                    for 18 seconds before you proceeded with the
                    powering-down?
      07:39:40 C    That's affirm. We stayed in PRELAUNCH, got the
                    light, and then powered-down about 15 minutes later.
      07:39:45 CC   Okay. You did get the COMPUTER RUN light?
      07:39:48 C    That's affirm.
      07:39:49 CC   Okay. Have you tried switching the auxiliary
                    receptacle yet?
      07:39:53 C    No. We'll troubleshoot that in a little bit here.
      07:39:56 CC   Okay. Very good.
      07:40:03 CC   Okay. We have a good reading on the Command Pilot
                    on the oral temp.
      07:40:07 C    Okay. Here comes the Pilot.
      07:40:41 CC   Do you happen to have any food or water report to
                    us as yet?
      07:40:53 C    Yes. We completed eating one meal. We're getting
                    ready to start another one and I'll give you a hack
                    on the water in a second.
      07:41:00 CC   Roger.
      07:41:30 C   We've had 40 ounces of water split about equally.
      07:41:37 CC   Roger. Understand. Could you identify that meal
                    for us?
	Page 94

                                                                         93
           07:41:52 C    Roger. Meal C, Day 2. Meal C and we split it.
           07:41:56 CC   Roger. Thank you.
           07:42:34 CC   Gemini IX, Hawaii. We have a valid oral temp on
                         both crew members.
           07:42:47 C    Okay.
           07:42:51 CC   Do you have any comments to make on the thermal
                         condition up there? How does it feel?
           07:42:56 C    Roger. We were warm during both the Rendezvous
                         and now that we've powered-down we're starting to
                         cool off. We're still running Suit Fans 1 and 2.
                         Neither one of us was perspiring at all, though.
           07:43:07 CC   Okay. Very good.

                              ROSE KNOT VICTOR

           08:10:15 CC   Gemini IX, RKV.
           08:10:17 C    Hello, RKV. Gemini IX here.
           08:10:20 CC   Roger. We're showing on the ground that you still
                         have both A pumps on Primary and Secondary Loop.
                         Was that to help to cool down or just what was the
                         reason?
           08:10:31 C    Affirmative. We still feel warm, that's why we
                         are on Pumps 1 and 2. We wanted to leave them on
                         a little while till we got cool.
           08:10:38 CC   Roger. Very good.
           08:10:41 CC   Okay. There's been a slight change on this Re-Rendezvous
                         because of the problem with ATDA ACQ
                         lights. We're considering the Re-Rendezvous with
                         an approach from above in daylight. What do you
                         think about that?
           08:11:01 C    ...
           08:11:04 CC   Say again.
	Page 95

      08:11:06 C    It doesn't make any difference. We can Rendezvous
                    in about any type of situation you can give us.
      08:11:11 CC   Okay. They'd would like to try this type of an
                    approach, daylight from above.
      08:11:27 CC   Okay, Gemini IX. We'd also like to get confirmation
                    that you have the C-Band in the COMMAND position.
      08:11:35 C    We've got the Adapter CONTINUOUS REENTRY ... will
                    go from ADAPTER to COMMAND.
      08:11:42 CC   Roger.
      08:11:52 C    Right now, on Gemini IX, our fuel budget looks
                    pretty good.
      08:11:58 CC   Say again, please.
      08:12:00 C    Roger. Looks like we have enough fuel to hack it.
      08:12:03 CC   Okay. Roger. Very good.
      08:12:48 CC   Okay, Gemini IX. We Just put a T<sub>X</sub> into the Spacecraft
                    to turn T/M off for us after our LOS.
      08:13:55 C    Roger. We saw the light.
      08:13:57 CC   Roger.
      08:17:24 CC   Gemini IX, RKV. We have about one minute to LOS.
      08:17:29 C    Roger.
                         TANANARIVE
      08:31:18 CC   Gemini IX, Houston.
      08:31:29 CC   Gemini IX, Houston.
      08:31:32 C    Go, Houston. Gemini IX here.
      08:31:34 CC   Roger, Tom. I have some questions from the Cape
                    concerning the shroud.

	Page 96

           08:31:41 C    Go ahead. I guess we're the experts.
           08:31:43 CC   I'm sure you are. I understand the shroud gap at
                         the base is about 3 to 4 inches. Is that correct?
           08:31:51 C    Roger. That is affirmative. It's about 3 to 4
                         inches wide down at the base. Both of the explosive
                         bolts at the base of the shroud, where it
                         attaches to the TDA, fired, and you can see the
                         little coiled springs in between. One coil spring
                         was attached sort of between both of them, and the
                         other coil spring wasn't ...
           08:32:16 CC   Roger. Understand. Can you estimate the gap between
                         the shroud at the strap and also at the apex?
                         Over.
           08:32:26 C    Again there are the small wires hooked to a connection
                         ... and bolts.
           08:32:39 CC   IX, Houston.
           08:32:50 CC   Gemini IX, Houston.
           08:33:10 C    ... maximum. When the signal was sent to Unrigidize,
                         the control unit moved back and forth
                         like it was real loose there. I'd say about 15 to
                         20 degrees.
           08:33:23 CC   Roger, Tom. Let me ask you some questions about
                         it. Can you estimate the distance between the
                         shroud at the strap, and also at the apex? Over.
           08:33:32 C    Say again, please.
           08:33:33 CC   Distance between the shroud halves at the strap
                         and at the apex.
           08:33:42 C    Roger. At the strap it's kind of hard to say -
                         we have 6 inches or more.
           08:33:53 CC   Yes.
           08:33:55 C    About 6 inches.
           08:33:57 CC   Okay. What about at the apex of it?

	Page 97

      08:34:00 C    At the top of it?
      08:34:02 CC   Affirm.
      08:34:04 C    2-1/2 feet, maybe 3 feet.
      08:34:07 CC   Okay. Does the strap appear to be tight, or does
                    it appear to be loose on it?
      08:34:12 C    It looks like the shroud has extended out to the
                    length of those two pyro connectors on each bolt
                    and opened the back end about 4 inches. Open it
                    up like a couple of jaws and you'll have the total
                    configuration. The angle between the two halves
                    is a good 20 degrees, maybe in excess of that.
      08:34:28 CC   Okay. Can you tell the length of the spring cartridges?
                    Can you see those well enough to tell me
                    if they look like they're fully extended?
      08:34:39 C    The spring cartridges just about reached their
                    full stroke for the ones we saw at the Cape the
                    other day.
      08:34:46 CC   Okay. Understand. Does it look like you can get
                    to the lanyard on the pyro wire just inside the
                    shroud? Over.
      08:34:56 C    There are four connectors there but from what I
                    can see the biggest question in my mind is whether
                    the lanyards were ever installed.
      08:35:05 CC   Okay. You think the lanyards are not even there,
                    right?
      08:35:08 C    I looked - probably we flew in within a couple of
                    feet. That's about as close as I could get in
                    position. I'd say the closest we got was about
                    2 feet, and I could plainly see the insulation on
                    the wiring. It was frayed. You could see the
                    connectors where they hooked into the bolts and
                    the way it was holding, but I couldn't actually
                    see the lanyards on it.
      08:35:31 CC   Okay. I understand. If that thing is open far
                    enough, do you think you could get in to pull the
                    lanyard on the QD on the umbilical? Over.

	Page 98

           08:35:43 C   Say again.
           08:35:44 CC   Do you think you could pull the lanyard on the
                         quick disconnect inside the shroud?
           08:35:53 C    Well, I'll ask Gene to talk to you on that.
           08:35:55 CC   Understand. One last question on the shroud. Has
                         it moved in relationship to the TDA? Has it
                         shifted fore and aft, or has it rotated any? Over.
           08:36:06 C    Pitched up and down, when it Unrigidized and
                         Rigidized - opened and closed a little bit and it
                         rotated. The total X-Axis of the shroud pitched
                         up and down a little bit, about 15 degrees. The
                         jaws opened a little bit.
           08:36:23 CC   Understand. Did you say it did rotate also?
           08:36:29 C    No, not much rotation ... mostly just the total
                         shroud ... pitched up and down about 15 degrees.
           08:36:37 CC   Okay. I understand. I think we've talked about
                         that shroud long enough. You can ignore this
                         locking on the target again at CSQ. Don't bother
                         doing that. We're satisfied with the Separation
                         ourselves and the S-12 Experimenter wants you to
                         listen for the door opening when you activate that
                         before the sleep period. Over.
           08:36:59 C    Say again, Dick, on the door.
           08:37:02 CC   When you activate S-12, the Experimenter would
                         like to have you listen and see if you can hear
                         the door opening.
           08:37:11 C    Roger. Will do that.
           08:37:16 C    Houston, Gemini IX. What are the latest plans for
                         EVA in the morning? Are we going to do it with the
                         ATDA or without it?
           08:37:25 CC   Tom, we're going to do it with the ATDA and we'll
                         do the EVA preparation right after Re-Rendezvous.
                         Over.
           08:37:34 C    Roger.

      08:37:37 CC   If we do that Re-Rendezvous in daylight, which we
                    would like to do down here, we're going to cut a
                    little bit into your EVA preparation, but it still
                    should give you about 3 hours and 45 minutes. Over.
      08:37:50 C    Okay. We'll probably be there when you get them.
      08:37:54 CC   Well, don't rush it. We think we'll give you
                    plenty of time to do that but it will be after
                    the Re-Rendezvous.
      08:38:03 C    How does the fuel budget look down there? It looks
                    like we have plenty for using the Delta-H of 7
                    miles.
      08:38:09 CC   Yes. We think you're in good shape.
      08:38:11 C    Yes. I think we're in real good shape on the fuel.
                    Okay, we're still keeping both Coolant Pumps A and
                    B on. We're still a little warm in here.
      08:38:25 CC   Okay. You might as well leave them on until you
                    cool down and we'll talk to you about the temperature
                    over CSQ.
      08:38:35 C    Okay. Real fine, Dick.
      08:38:47 CC   IX, Houston. Tom, have you had a chance to look
                    at that auxiliary receptacle yet?
      08:38:53 C    No, we're still busy trying to get some ... squared
                    away. We'll do this in the next hour or so.
      08:38:58 CC   Okay. If you can't get that left one fixed, we've
                    got it planned down here that you can use the right
                    one, but we'll hold up and wait and see what you
                    say about it.
      08:39:08 C    Okay.
      08:39:31 CC   IX, Houston. We've got 15 seconds to Tananarive
                    at LOS. We'll see you later.
      08:39:37 C    Roger.

            08:55:29 C     Gemini IX. Go, CSQ.
            08:55:32 CC    Roger. We show you GO on the ground. We'd like
                           to inform you that we're going to command the L-Band
                           OFF on the ATDA.
            08:55:39 C    Roger.
            08:55:40 CC   Roger. You can start your fuel cell purge any
                          time now.
            08:55:43 C    Okay. I'm at purge.
            08:55:53 CC   And we also have a PLA and a Flight Plan update
                          for you to copy when you're ready.
            08:56:04 C    Roger. Understand. I'll give you a call in a
                          minute.
            08:56:07 CC   Roger.
            08:57:03 P    CSQ, Gemini IX. I'll go ahead and take some of
                          those PLA updates and I'll have to stop you
                          during - I'm still going on with the purge.

      09:00:40 CC   That's affirmative. No Separation Maneuver required.
      09:00:44 P    Roger. We got it, thank you.
      09:00:46 CC   Are you ready for a Flight Plan update?
      09:00:49 P    Stand by one.
      09:01:24 CC   Gemini IX. Be advised we're going to turn the
                    adapter C-Band off on the ATDA.
      09:01:32 P    Roger. Understand, and you can go ahead with the
                    update; our purge is complete.
      09:01:37 CC   Would you switch your Quantity Read switch to ECS
                    O<sub>2</sub>?
      09:01:41 P    ECS O<sub>2</sub>.

      09:12:52 C    Hawaii, IX.
      09:12:54 CC   Roger. Everything is looking good on the ground.
                    We'd like for you to place your Quantity Read
                    switch to FUEL CELL H<sub>2</sub> position, please.
      09:13:00 C    Roger.
	Page 102

           09:13:04 CC   Roger. We're going to get a tape dump on you this
                         pass. We have a Flight Plan update for you if
                         you're ready to copy.
           09:13:22 P    All right, Hawaii. Gemini IX.
           09:13:24 CC   Okay. You probably have part of this. Node:
                         07:13:19; Rev 5, 95.3 east; right ascension, 20
                         hours 01 minute. S-12: 09:00:00; 01 after all
                         overboard dump S-12: 17:00:00; 02. That's all.
           09:14:22 P    Gemini IX. Roger. We have node at 07:13:19;
                         Rev 5, 95.3 east; right ascension, 20 hours 01
                         minute S-12: 09:00; 01 after all overboard dumps
                         S-12: 17:00, 02.
           09:14:43 CC   That's 17:00:00, Sequence Number 2.
           09:14:49 P    I got it. Sequence 1 and Sequence 2.
           09:14:51 CC   Roger. And also there is a tropical storm that
                         will be 77 miles south of your ground track at an
                         elapsed time of 09:21:30, if you happen to be in
                         the right attitude to look at it.
           09:15:12 P    Okay. We'll give it a try.
           09:15:14 CC   Okay. You can place your Quantity Read switch
                         back to the OFF position.
           09:15:25 CC   Have you had time to get around to that auxiliary
                         receptacle yet?
           09:15:31 P    Negative. We haven't.
           09:15:32 CC   Roger.
           09:15:37 P    It operates the camera all right.The problem we
                         had was operating the sight. We've done a little
                         switching around, but we can't - - we haven't
                         really made any good thorough troubleshooting yet.
           09:15:49 CC   Roger. I understand.
           09:16:08 CC   Gemini IX, Hawaii.
           09:16:10 P    Go, Hawaii.
	Page 103

       09:16:12  CC    The camera was what they were really worried about.
       09:16:16  P     Okay. We were pretty worried about the sight
                       there for a while but we rigged it up from the
                       right receptacle and the camera works okay from
                       the left.
       09:16:23  CC    Okay. Very good.
       09:20:30  CC    Gemini IX, Hawaii. We have 30 seconds to LOS and
                       are standing by.
       09:20:35  P     Gemini IX. Roger.
       09:20:39  C     Looks like we are going to miss that storm. We're
                       pointed up and to the northwest right now.

       17:45:09  C     Good morning, Houston. Gemini IX.
       17:45:10  CC    Good morning. How are you doing?
       17:45:11  C     Warmed up. We ran down to 0, 0, 0 degrees.
       17:45:15  CC    You say you do have your - started your power-up?
       17:45:18  C     Roger. Platform is up. Fairly well alined.
       17:45:22  CC    Okay. Is your computer up yet?
       17:45:24  C     No. Get it up in just a second.
       17:45:27  CC    Okay. Like to have you turn it on and tell us
                       whether you get a running light.
       17:45:31  C     Roger.
       17:45:32  CC    In PRELAUNCH.
       17:45:37  C     Computer coming ON.

	Page 104

            17:45:39 CC   And while you're waiting you can turn the S-12
                          collector door CLOSED.
            17:45:45 C    Roger. We've already got the collector door
                          closed.
            17:45:48 CC   Roger.
            17:45:51 CC   And I've got a RT change and some maneuver updates
                          when you're ready to copy.
            17:46:15 C    Houston, Gemini IX. We have a Computer Running
                          light at 8:26.
            17:46:20 CC   Very good. I'm glad to hear that. And let me
                          know when you're ready to copy the R<sub>T</sub> and maneuver
                          updates.
            17:46:51 P    Go ahead, Neil.
            17:46:52 CC   Okay. Your R<sub>T</sub> is now - that's Address 54, 74966.
                          This is a fairly big change but we've checked it
                          out.
            17:47:08 P    Understand. 54 is now 74966.
            17:47:12 CC   Roger. And your elevation angle of depression,
                          angle to Aline the Platform, will be minus 9 degrees.
            17:47:19 P    Roger. Understand.
            17:47:21 CC   Okay. And don't forget that you've got to change
                          Address 24.
            17:47:27 P    Okay.
            17:47:30 CC   Okay. We're ready for - your Height-Adjust Maneuver.
            17:47:42 P    Okay, shoot.
            17:47:43 CC   Okay. Let me give you the Phase-Adjust first.
                          GET B: 18:23:19; Delta-V, 20.0; burn time, 3
                          seconds; yaw 0, pitch 0; Address 25, 00020; 26
                          and 27, all zeros; aft thrusters; Posigrade. I'll
                          go ahead with the Height-Adjust now. GET B is
	Page 105

                       19:08:16; Delta-V, 17.0 burn time, 22 seconds;
                       yaw 0, pitch 0; Address 25, 00170; Address 26,
                       all zero; Address 27, zeros; aft thrusters, Posigrade.
                       That's Height-Adjust. Go ahead.
        17:48:47 P     Okay. Now was that two Height-Adjust? Was the
                       first one Height-Adjust also?
        17:48:51 CC    First one, Phase-Adjust.
        17:48:53 P     Okay.
        17:48:56 P     Phase-Adjust is at 18:23:18: 2 feet per second;
                       3-second burn; yaw 0, pitch 0; 25 is 00020; 26
                       and 27, all zeros; aft thrusters; Posigrade.
        17:49:13 CC    Roger. That's correct. I've got a node update.
        17:49:18 P     I'd like the GET Burn at Height-Adjust, please.
        17:49:22 CC    Okay. The GET Burn of the Height-Adjust is
                       19:08:16.
        17:49:33 P    Got 19:08:1 something.
        17:49:36 CC    That's 19:08:16.
        17:49:41 P     16, Roger. And I copied the rest to be 17 feet
                       per second; 22-second burn; yaw 0, pitch 0; 25,
                       00170; 6 and 7, all zeros; aft thrusters, Posigrade.
        17:49:53 CC    That's correct. And I have a node for you.
        17:49:58 P     Okay.
        17:50:01 CC    Its time is 16:14:21: Rev 11, 43 degree west;
                       right ascension, 19 hours 50 minutes.
        17:50:23 P    Roger. Copied Node to be 16:14:21; Rev 11, 43
                      degrees west; right ascension, 19 hours 50 minutes.
        17:50:34 CC   Roger. That's correct. You can do a fuel cell
                      purge between now and Canaries, which will be
                       about 5 minutes or so from now. And they will
                      have a block update on PLA's at Canaries and advise
                      that their - they've got a shroud in work.
                      Dave Scott's out at Los Angeles working on a -

                           the procedures for it.
             17:51:05 P    Okay, fine. And you say go ahead with the fuel
                           cell purge now?
             17:51:09 CC   Yes, that's correct.
             17:51:12 CC   And we're approaching LOS here. We'll give you
                           the PLA's over Canaries.
             17:51:17 C    Roger. How are you reading us, Neil?
             17:51:20 CC   Reading you loud and clear, Tom.

                                 CANARY ISLANDS

             17:56:14 C    Flight. Gemini IX to Canary CAP COM.
             17:56:17 C    Canary, Gemini IX.
             17:56:19 CC   Roger. I have a PLA update for you when you're
                           ready to copy.
             17:56:22 C    Can you give us a hack at a GET 17:57:00?
             17:56:28 CC   Roger. Will do.
             17:56:32 CC   30 minutes, 30 seconds to hack.
             17:56:45 P    After the hack you can go ahead with the update.
             17:56:47 CC   Roger. Will do.
             17:56:58 CC   3, 2, 1,
             17:57:01 CC   MARK. 17:57:00.
             17:57:05 C    Roger. Give us a hack at ten just for recheck.
             17:57:07 CC   Roger. 3, 2, 1,
             17:57:11 CC   MARK. Ten seconds.
             17:57:13 C    Roger. We're in sync.

      17:57:15 CC   Roger.
      17:57:36 CC   Gemini IX, are you ready for your PLA update?
      17:57:41 P    Roger. All set - any time.
      17:57:44 CC   Roger. 13-2: 19:02:32; 21 plus 22, 27 plus 22;
                    roll left 85, roll right 95; weather, good;
                    negative Sep Maneuver. 14-1: 20:28:25; 22 plus
                    35; 28 plus 25; roll left 85, roll right 95;

                    - 21 plus 18.
      17:59:26 CC   Affirmative on a Sep Maneuver.
      17:59:33 CC   Gemini IX. The last three columns are all the
                    same from here on out, so we'll just give you the
                    first. Okay?
      17:59:38 P    Okay. And now what were the first two areas that
                    you gave me?
      17:59:43 CC   Say again.
      17:59:45 P    Give me the first two areas, just the area. I
                    got all the numbers but the areas on the first two.
      17:59:50 CC   Okay. The first area was 13-2; the second area
                    14-1.
      17:59:57 P    Okay. You can go ahead.
      17:59:59 CC   Okay. The next area is 17-2: 25:26:01; 21 plus
                    15; 27 plus 12. Could you put your Quantity Read
                    switch to ECS O<sub>2</sub>?
      18:00:20 P    Roger.
      18:00:24 CC   Okay. Area 18-4: 28:07:53; 21 plus 11; 27 plus
                    16. Area 19-4: 29:43:26; 21 plus 18; 27 plus 19.
                    Area 20-3: - Gemini IX, give us FUEL CELL O<sub>2</sub>,
                    please. Okay. - Area 20-3: 31:02:25; 21 plus 02;
                    27 plus 07; and give us FUEL CELL H<sub>2</sub>.
      18:01:31 CC   That's the end of the PLA update, Gemini IX.
	Page 108

            18:01:35 P    Roger. The only question I have is 20-3 RET V.
                          Please say again.
            18:01:41 CC   RET V for Area 20-3: 27 plus 07.
            18:01:46 P    Roger. And the only two that require Sep Maneuvers
                          are 15-1 and 16-1. Is that correct?
            18:01:51 CC   That's affirmative. Negative on that. The Sep
                          Maneuver comes from 15-1 through all the rest.
                          15-1 through 20-3. You have a Sep Maneuver with
                          all of those.
            18:02:03 P    Roger. I've got them all.
            18:02:05 CC   Okay. Could you give us a Prop Quantity readout
                          please?
            18:02:11 P    Roger. Reading about 39 percent.
            18:02:12 CC   Roger. Copy 39.
            18:02:19 CC   We have you as GO on the ground here, Gemini IX.
                          How did your fuel cells purge go?
            18:02:23 P    Fuel cell purge went well and we're GO up here.
            18:02:26 CC   Roger.
            18:02:54 CC   Gemini IX, Canaries. We did - we have just turned
                          the L-Band Beacon ON on the ATDA.
            18:02:59 P    Roger.
            18:03:12 CC   IX, Canaries. You can turn your Quantity Read
                          OFF at this time.
                               KANO
            18:04:23 CC   Gemini IX, Houston. 1 minute from LOS at Kano.
            18:04:29 C    Roger. Houston. We're all set up for our burn.
            18:04:41 CC   Roger. Congratulations for making it past 7-3.
	Page 109

      18:04:47 C   Roger, Neil. Thank you.
      18:23:19 C    Rates adjust.
      18:23:20 P    Mark it.
      18:23:25 P    Okay.
       18:23:29 C    ...
       18:23:33 P    82 is 0, 81 is minus 1, - and 80 is zero.
       18:23:57 C    The next burn ...
       18:24:01 C    Let's put the thing in RENDEZVOUS.
       18:24:04 P    Okay. The next burn is at 19:08:16.
       18:24:09 C    What about that time ...?
       18:24:11 P    Oh, yes. That's almost an hour away. 19:08:16.
                     Okay?
                          CARNARVON
       18:33:44 CC   Gemini IX, Carnarvon CAP COM.
       18:33:48 C    Carnarvon, IX.
       18:33:49 CC   Roger. How did the Phase-Adjust go?
       18:33:51 C    On time and all residuals zero.
       18:33:53 CC   Roger. Would you give me a readout of AMU H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>
                     pressure and temperature.
       18:34:05 P    Okay. Temperature is holding and has been holding
                     at about 65 degrees and pressure is locked on 85
                     psi.
       18:34:15 CC   Roger.
       18:34:21 CC   I have a Flight Plan update. A short one for you
                     when you're ready to copy.
	Page 110

            18:34:28 P     Stand by one.
            18:34:51 P     Okay, Bill, go ahead.
            18:34:55  CC   Okay. At 19 hours, 19 minutes: Antigua, Rev 13;
                            a GO/NO-GO for 31-1. At 19 hours 30 minutes:
                            Canaries, Rev 13; a crew status report.
            18:35:17  P    Say that time again at Canaries for crew status?
            18:35:20  CC    19 plus 30.
            18:35:21  P     19 plus 30. Roger.
            18:35:25  CC   Okay. And I also have a star update for you.
            18:35:44 P      Okay. Go with the star update.
            18:35:47  CC    Okay. Time: 19:08:16; and I don't know if I can
                            pronounce it, but I'll give it a try, Alpheratz,
                            or would you buy Alpheratz? It's 3.5 degrees up
                            and 4 degrees left.
            18:36:06  CC    That's Alpheratz.
            18:36:08  P     Alpheratz sounds good. 19:08:16; 3.5 up; 4 left.
            18:36:12  CC    Roger.
            18:36:36  CC   Gemini IX, Carnarvon. We're coming up on LOS in
                            about 40 seconds.
            18:36:47  P     Gemini IX. Roger.
            19:07:24  C    We're approaching Height-Adjust for the third
                            rendezvous. Delta-V to be applied is 7-8 feet per
                            second Posigrade at 19:08:16.
            19:07:47  C     ... rate.
            19:07:59  C     An Alpha burn should do it.
            19:08:02  P     Okay. Don't forget Plat.
            19:08:12  P     10, 13, 14, 15 -
            19:08:17  P     MARK.
	Page 111

      19:08:18 C    Mark it.
      19:08:39 P    Okay.
      19:08:44 P    That's good ...
                         HOUSTON
      19:18:50 CC   Gemini IX, Houston.
      19:18:24 CC   Gemini IX, Houston.
      19:18:40 C    Hello, Houston. Gemini IX. How do you read?
      19:18:42 CC   Roger, Tom. Read you loud and clear. How me?
      19:18:45 C    Roger. Read you loud and clear now, Neil.
      19:18:48 CC   Okay. Could you give us a Peroxide Temperature,
                    please?
      19:18:52 C    Roger. 65 degrees.
      19:18:55 CC   Roger. 65 degrees. And I have an N<sub>SR</sub> update for
                    you when you're ready to copy.
      19:19:02 C    Roger. Stand by.
      19:19:06 C    Ready to copy.
      19:19:08 CC   Okay. GET B: 19:53:27; Delta-V, 14.3; burn time,
                    25 seconds; yaw 180, pitch 20 down, 20 down;
                    Address 25, 00134; Address 26, 90049; Address 27,
                    zeros; forward thrusters; Posigrade Up. Go ahead.
      19:20:00 P    Houston, Gemini IX. You were coming in somewhat
                    broken on that. N<sub>SR</sub> update: GET B is 19:45:27;
                    Delta-V is 14.3; duration is 25 seconds; yaw 180,
                    pitch 20 down; 25, 00134; 26, 90049; 27, zeros;
                    forward; Posigrade Up.
      19:20:32 CC   That's correct except I'd like to correct your
                    GET B. That's 19:53:27. Go ahead.
      19:20:43 P    Roger. Got 19:53:27 GET B.
	Page 112

            19:20:47 CC   That's right. And we're using the forward
                          thrusters here so that you all have - you won't
                          have to turn around and lose radar lock and that
                          stuff.
            19:20:56 P    Fine. Thank you.
            19:20:58 CC   Okay. Give us Prop Quantity, please.
            19:21:03 C    Roger. Prop Quantity is 35 percent.
            19:21:07 CC   Okay. 35. And you'll have a crew status report
                          over Canaries in about 10 minutes or so. Like to
                          tell you what the maneuver plan is right now.
            19:21:19 C    Okay.
            19:21:21 CC   Okay. After N<sub>SR</sub> you'll have about an hour and
                          five minutes before TPI and you'll be hitting TPI
                          just about sunrise, and the rest of the maneuver
                          from TPI on in will be in daylight.
            19:21:39 C    Roger.
            19:21:41 CC   And we're talking about seeing whether we can
                          get the lights on for you before TPI, for backup.
            19:21:49 C    How's the power doing on the ATDA? Is it getting
                          pretty low?
            19:21:54 CC   Yes. We don't have any too much in those squib
                          batteries.
            19:21:58 C    Okay.
            19:22:06 CC   How'd your Height Maneuver come out?
            19:22:08 C    All residuals were zero. We had ...
            19:22:12 CC   Very good.
            19:22:17 C    We're yawing around now to 180.
            19:22:22 CC   Okay. Like to advise you you're GO for 31-1.
            19:22:26 C    Roger. 31-1.
	Page 113

      19:22:30 C   How are things in Houston this morning?
      19:22:32 CC   Oh, we're busy as beavers down here.
      19:22:35 C    I can imagine.
      19:22:47 P    You guys keep some terrible hours down there.
      19:22:51 CC   Yes. You do, too. Astros lost last night to
                    Pittsburgh 7 to 2.
      19:22:58 P    How'd the Cubs do?
      19:23:01 CC   Stand by.
      19:23:03 CC   Cubs lost 8 to 6 to Cincinnati.
      19:23:08 P    I'm a double loser.
      19:23:10 CC   You've got to expect a few losses.
      19:23:40 CC  We've just been talking to Dave Scott and Jim
                    McDivitt at some length. They've been climbing
                    around the shroud out at Douglas for the last few
                    hours and they advised the outside is no problem.
                    The inside may turn out to be a problem. There's
                    quite a few sharp edges and things on the inside,
                    cotter keys, and one thing or another.
      19:24:06 C    Roger.
      19:24:59 CC   Did you happen to just punch START COMP or change
                    modes or something in the computer?
      19:25:05 C    Yes. I checked out my load at 25, 6 and 7.
      19:25:09 CC   Okay. Big Brother's watching down here.
      19:25:13 C    Roger, Neil. Looks like our computer has cleared
                    up completely. It was only about the first day
                    after you know ... when we ran into this problem,
                    and late yesterday evening everything looked real
                    good.
      19:25:25 CC   Okay, Tom. It looks all okay on the ground to us,
                    too.
	Page 114

            19:25:29 C    Okay. I don't know what the glitch was.
            19:25:32 C    Also, we changed cords and I had Gene's utility
                          cord, so I've got my camera in the optical sight
                          going okay over here.
            19:25:40 CC   Roger. I understand.
            19:26:01 CC   Do you have - you don't have the radar on yet, do
                          you?
            19:26:06 C    No, I don't. You want me to turn it on?
            19:26:08 CC   Stand by.
            19:26:13 CC   Yes, we'd like to have you turn it on and see if
                          you can get a lock, and maybe you can report a
                          range reading over the Canaries and help FIDO a
                          little bit here.
            19:26:23 C    Roger. We got it too. Stand by.
            19:26:32 CC   We're not going to have much track after N<sub>SR</sub> to
                          help you out with.
            19:26:38 C    Okay.
            19:27:27 CC   Houston's about to have LOS at Antigua.
            19:27:31 C    Roger. Neil, we're trying to Aline the Platform
                          BEF.
            19:27:33 CC   Right.

                                CANARY ISLANDS

            19:32:04 CC   Gemini IX, CAP COM. We have a valid oral temp on
                          both Pilot and Command Pilot.
            19:32:14 C    Roger. We have forward radar lock. We'll give
                          you some ranges.
            19:32:17 CC   Roger. I have a coelliptic update when you're
                          ready to copy.
	Page 115

      19:32:24 C   Go ahead.
      19:32:27 CC  GET B: 19:54:24; Delta-V, 14.4; burn time, 0 plus
                   25; yaw 180, pitch 38 down; Address 25, 00114;
                   Address 26, 90089; Address 27, all zeros; thrusters
                    forward; Maneuver Posigrade and Up; Coelliptic.
                    Do you copy?
      19:33:04 P   Roger. N<sub>SR</sub> update: GET B is 19:54:24; 14.4; 25
                    seconds burn time; yaw 180, pitch 38 down; 25 is
                    00114; 26 is 90089; 27, all zeros; forward
                    thrusters; Posigrade Up.
      19:33:28 CC   That's affirmative, Gemini.
      19:33:44 P    Canaries, we're now at 83.8 miles.
      19:33:48 CC   Roger. Copy.
      19:33:57 CC   Gemini IX. We're standing by for your food report.
      19:34:02 C    Roger. We have consumed 4-1/2 meals and 110 ounces
                    of water.
      19:34:10 CC   Roger. 110 ounces.
      19:34:50 CC   Gemini IX, could you also give me a sleep report?
      19:34:55 C    We had eight hours of dozing.
      19:34:58 CC   Roger. Copy.
      19:36:20 P    Canaries, we're at 82.3 miles with a Range-Rate
                    of 69 feet per second.
      19:36:26 CC   Roger. Copy.
                         HOUSTON
      19:39:56 CC   Gemini IX, Houston standing by.
      19:39:59 C    Roger, Houston. We're Alining the Platform and
                    approaching N<sub>SR</sub>.
      19:40:03 CC   Okay. It looks like you've got good radar. We
                    are willing to turn those lights on for you if
                    you think you'd like to have them prior to TPI.

	Page 116

                       But it would mean that you'd have to turn them
                       off, you'd have to send a Command to turn them
                       off, just as soon as you got in daylight. Thought
                       you wouldn't need them.
           19:40:25 C   Okay. ... turn them on right at the last minute
                        and then we can ... It's getting daylight.
           19:40:36 CC  I didn't copy you there, Tom.
           19:40:40 C   Turned the ACQ lights on at the latest possible
                        station and we will turn them off as soon as we
                        hit daylight.
           19:40:49 CC  Okay. We'll do that. We'll turn them on at
                        Carnarvon. That's at 20 hours and about 12 by
                        20 hours and 10 minutes.
           19:54:02 P   Okay. Coming up on the N - N<sub>SR</sub> burn at 19:54:24
                        for the Rendezvous from above; 10 seconds to
                        initiate, - in RATE COMMAND.
           19:54:12 P   2, 1 -
           19:54:25 P   Burn it.
           19:54:27 P   Clock is started.
           19:54:49 C   ... is the ...
           19:54:51 C   Okay. 81, - 82 is minus 02, 81 is 01.
           19:55:33 C   Looks good. 80 is zero. That's good.
           19:55:37 P   Okay. Starting the clock in N<sub>SR</sub>.
           19:55:41 C   Roger.
           19:55:44 C   And we have about 32 percent fuel remaining.
           19:55:54 P   32.
           19:56:08 P   You can set your clock if you like.
           19:56:11 P   Now, let's see. Coming up on 2 minutes now. So
                        you can set it to 3 or 4.

	Page 117

      19:57:08 P   What have you got your clock set for?
      19:57:10 C   3 minutes.
      19:57:14 P   Okay. About 10 seconds here.
      19:57:24 P   3, 2, 1 -
      19:57:25 P   Mark it.
      19:57:26 P   Three minutes. Did you get it?
      19:57:27 C   Yes.
      19:57:29 P   7, 8, 9, 10. Okay?
      19:57:54 P  Go into RENDEZVOUS with 4 minutes and see what
                   happens.
      20:00:18 C   ... we're down 10 degrees already ...
      20:00:25 P   Give me an angle and I'll get it for you the next
                   time.
      20:00:30 P   ...
      20:00:31 C   MARK.
      20:00:34 C   ...
      20:00:46 P   Yes. Nominally we're pretty close on this.
      20:00:47 C   ...
      20:00:54 P   Let's see there's - F-189 is NOMINAL.
      20:00:58 C   We're supposed to Aline the Platform.
      20:01:00 P   At 9 degrees; that's right.
      20:01:02 C   ...
      20:01:03 P   So go ahead.
      20:01:10 P   Right now ... is .01 but we'll have what happens
                   here.
	Page 118

            20:01:12 P    Yes.
            20:01:13 C    ...
            20:01:18 P    That's only one - -
            20:02:10 C    Did you happen to find my sunglasses ...
            20:02:12 P    - - It's right up here.
            20:02:13 C    Good show!
            20:03:01 P    Okay. All the numbers are in.
            20:03:47 C    ...
            20:03:48 P    Do I have any? Yes. I've got some here somewhere.
            20:03:51 P    I read 69 here at 9 minutes. We passed 9 minutes.
            20:03:54 C   Copy. 9 minutes.
            20:04:25 P    Here you are, Tom.
            20:04:32 C    I'll just have one piece.
            20:04:36 P    You can have both if you want to.
            20:04:38 C    I've got a bunch of them.
            20:04:49 P    Yes. Between us we have plenty.
            20:05:14 P    ... this is going to be a real bear, you know it?
            20:05:17 P    I wonder if I should put that suit fan on?
            20:05:24 C    ...
            20:05:25 P    This one over here.
            20:05:27 C    You've got the Polaroid, don't you?
            20:05:58 P    Much better.
            20:06:01 C    Yes. We ... should stay on better ...
            20:06:20 P    What time have you got?

     20:07:23 C    Carnarvon, IX. Go.
     20:07:26 CC   Roger. Would you turn the Tape Recorder Power
                   circuit breaker OFF?
     20:07:30 C    Roger. OFF.
     20:07:35 CC   Would you verify the Telemetry Standby Control
                   switch is OFF?
     20:07:40 C    OFF. It's OFF.
     20:07:42 CC  Roger.
     20:07:51 C    Delta, Delta-R still looking good?
     20:07:53 P    That's affirm. ... ...
     20:07:56 CC   Could you give us a Prop Quantity readout.
     20:07:58 C    Roger. 32 percent.
     20:08:01 CC   Roger.
     20:08:04 CC   How did the N<sub>SR</sub> burn go?
     20:08:05 C    On time and 80 was 0, 81 was one tenth, and 82
                   was about two tenths.

            20:51:52 CC   Gemini IX, Houston standing by.
            20:52:29 C    From the rendezvous from above, we have reflected
                         moonlight on the target.
            20:52:42 P    What's the range?

	Page 121

      20:52:43 C    20 miles?
      20:52:44 P    Range is about 20 miles, Tom.
      20:52:51 P    We're going to initiate after the ground time,
                    but that's all right because we're - if you've got
                    it, that's all that counts.
      20:52:54 C    ...
      20:52:57 P    59 minutes. We'll get good angles.
      20:53:01 CC   This is Houston. No answer required. Remember
                    to turn ACQ lights off.
      20:53:08 C    Roger. Neil, we have no ACQ lights. Thus far
                    I've got him in reflected moonlight at 20 miles.
      20:53:14 CC   Roger. Understand.
      20:53:22 C    Right on the angle.
      20:53:38 P    21 miles.

      20:54:13 C    Pretty good. Turn the ACQ lights OFF at 40 ...
      20:54:17 P    Roger.
      20:54:22 P    Okay. At 40 I want ... 21.
      20:54:32 P    Here's where we are Tom.
      20:54:34 C    Where's it, Gene?
      20:54:36 P    Right there.
      20:54:37 C    Good show! Got NOMINAL, right?
      20:54:41 P    The next one is probably going to be Point B.
	Page 122

             20:54:43 C   Here comes sunrise and I may lose the ATDA.
             20:54:45 P   Okay at 40 -
             20:55:00 P   Okay, I want an angle at 40.
             20:55:10 P   201.7 not quite in. No it's .8.
             20:55:24 C   We're still in reflected moonlight and now going
                          to reflected sunlight. We can break out into the

                          Hold onto him if you can.
            20:55:53 C    ... get ...
            20:56:00 P    Are you holding onto him?
            20:56:05 C    Yes.
            20:56:10 C    Yes. I've got him in reflected sunlight.
            20:56:15 P    This is Point B coming up.
            20:56:17 C    And ...
            20:56:21 P    220 at the time.
            20:56:22 C    Okay. I'll be on him.
            20:56:28 P    It might even be Point C, so hold onto it.
            20:56:42 P    Okay.
            20:56:43 C    Stand by.
            20:56:44 P    Okay.
            20:56:45 C    Got him.
            20:56:59 P    That was Point B.
	Page 123

      20:57:00 C    Still have him in reflected sunlight in a sunrise
                    now.
      20:57:15 C    Caught like a particle of dust.
      20:57:28 P    Houston, Gemini IX. Elevation 203.0; 18.82 miles;

      20:57:36 CC   Houston. Roger.
      20:57:37 C    Starting to lose him.
      20:57:38 P    That was Point B, Tom.
      20:57:39 C    Come on, hang on. That's all.
      20:57:40 P    You don't have him?
      20:57:41 C    No. That's all she wrote.
      20:57:42 P    Okay. That's 4 minutes. ...
      20:57:43 C    Lost him just before - Point C, in the clouds.
      20:57:45 CC   Houston's commanded ACQ lights OFF.
      20:57:48 P    See you in the clouds.
      20:57:51 P    The next point is Point C though. I may not get
                    a backup - yet I may.
      20:57:56 C    Okay. I'm flying radar needles.
      20:57:58 P    Okay.
      20:58:03 P    Don't let me miss - 5, 4 minutes. Okay?
      20:58:04 C    Yes.
      20:58:20 P    Okay. Is that 4 minutes?
      20:58:23 C    4 minutes and 4 seconds to go.
      20:58:24 P    Okay.
      20:58:26 P    Mark it.

	Page 124

            20:58:27 C    Got it! Now one was an optical angle. The other
                          was radar. Sorry about that, Gene.
            20:58:31 P    That's all right.
            20:58:36 P    What's Point C?
            20:58:37 C    Point C is 37. Looking pretty good. Want to
                          push START COMP?
            20:58:45 P    ... two way ...
            20:58:47 C    I know he's out there. I can't see him at all.
            20:58:55 P    Push START COMP.
            20:58:56 C    START COMP pushed.
            20:59:02 C    19 forward, 2 left and 4 down. Would you believe
                          it?
            20:59:10 P    Okay. Well they gave - I don't like the down.
            20:59:12 C    I don't either.
            20:59:16 P   Houston, Gemini IX. Elevation 204.2; range 17:72.
                          Don't let me - -
            20:59:21 CC   Houston. Roger.
             20:59:25 P   - - Ground gave 60.5 forward, 3/10ths up, and
                          205 - 2.5 right and you have left.
             20:59:34 C   What do you have?
             20:59:36 P   I don't have it, Joe. I've got to get Point D at
                          5:40. 204.2 and 7/10ths.
             20:59:38 C    ... I'll get it.
             20:59:42 C   Houston. Closed-Loop is 20 forward, 2 left,
                          3 down.
             20:59:48 P   I don't like the down, Tom. Because we're
                          coming - -
             20:59:49 CC  Got it.
	Page 125

      20:59:50 P   - - we're coming down.
      20:59:51 C   Yes. I don't like the down either. The down
                   doesn't look good from here at this time.
      20:59:53 C   Telemetry doesn't look good from here at this
                   time.
      20:59:54 P   Okay. 5:40, Tom. This is my angle for backup.
      20:59:58 C   Okay. I'm on the radar needles for you.
      21:00:04 P   Mark it.
      21:00:05 C   Right. I sure did.
      21:00:12 P   20 -
      21:01:45 P   Houston, Gemini IX. Data point D is 206.0; 16.60

      21:01:53 CC  Houston. Roger.
      21:01:57 C   Houston, this is IX. We're taking the backup
                    solution, staying Closed-Loop.
      21:02:01 CC  Roger. Understand.
      21:02:07 C    Backup reads 17 forward and 3 up; 17 forward and
                    3 up.
      21:02:12 CC   Houston. Roger.
      21:07:22 C    Houston. Gemini IX transmitting into blind. We
                   will Aline Platform after five minutes. Have 30
                    percent fuel remaining.
      21:07:29 CC   Roger, IX. Canary CAP COM. Roger. We copy.
      21:07:35 C    Roger. We will Aline Platform. The Closed-Loop
                    is cranking and we used a backup solution. We
                    have 30 percent fuel remaining.
      21:07:43 CC   Roger. Copy.
      21:07:45 C    And we cannot see him against the sunlit ocean
                    below, even though we are down to 12 miles.

                           No angle. No Range-Rate. We're at 10.21 miles.
             21:10:16 CC   Roger.
             21:11:48 C    Canary, this is Gemini IX. We're Alining and I
                           do not get any range or Range-Rate out of the
                           computer at this time.

             21:13:41 CC   Roger.
             21:13:43 C    And we're passing over the sand dunes of the
                           Sahara and note also some of the lava flows here
                           and we're looking straight down at him and I still
                           can't see him.
             21:13:51 CC   Roger, IX.
             21:13:56 C    Still no visual contact with the target at this
                           time. We're at 7 miles.
             21:14:00 P    Right here, Tom. Right inside. See?
             21:14:06 C    Yes.
             21:14:07 P    Shall we - -
             21:14:08 C    We'll whip the stuff out of him.
             21:14:10 P    - - ... break.
             21:14:13 P    Should give us a boosting error at 11:40.

	Page 127

      21:14:19 C   Say, there's the sand dunes. I'll photograph
                   one. Now don't worry about me. We'll make the
                   rendezvous.
      21:14:25 P   You ought to see him come across that.
      21:14:29 C   Oh, shoot!
      21:14:36 P    Computer lights are ON. Got anything yet?
      21:14:44 C    ... 4 forward, 5 left, and 1 up.
      21:14:48 P    4 aft.
      21:14:49 C    4 forward - -
      21:14:50 P    - - 3 aft - -
      21:14:51 C    - - 3 aft, - 4 aft.
      21:14:52 P    4 aft.
      21:14:53 C    5 left, 1 up. Looking good.
      21:14:57 P    Take the 1 up and 4 aft. I don't care about the
                    5 left. It's up to you.
      21:15:03 C    Do you want the 1 up?
      21:15:04 P    Yes. I'll take the 1 up.
      21:15:06 C    ...
      21:15:07 P    Yes. You can take the aft.
      21:15:08 C    Yes. ...
      21:15:25 P    Do you take the left or half of it?
      21:15:27 C    Half of it.
      21:15:33 P    Okay. 13 minutes I want an angle, Tom. - Okay?
                    What are we coming up on, 12 minutes or 13?
      21:15:43 C    13.
      21:15:44 P    Okay.

           21:16:21 CC   Houston standing by.
           21:17:57 CC   Houston standing by.
           21:17:59 C    Roger, Houston. We're down to a little over 3
                         miles, looking straight down into the Sahara
                         Desert and no visual contact. We're locked on
                         forward on radar.
           21:18:09 CC   Understand.
           21:18:12 P    Houston, elevation is 238.4; range, 5.06; Range-Rate,

           21:20:14 CC   Houston. Roger.
           21:20:20 CC   Houston is one minute to LOS.
           21:20:22 C    Roger.
           21:20:31 CC   Okay, IX. Houston. Advise your fuel cutoff is
                         5 percent on the gage.
           21:20:44 C    Down to 3 miles and still no visual contact with
                         the target centered on.
           21:20:49 CC   Houston, Roger.
           21:21:08 C    Houston, Roger. Finally have a look at what's
                         down there and request ...
           21:21:14 CC   Houston. Roger.
                              CARNARVON
           21:42:03 C    Hello, Houston. Gemini IX.

	Page 129

       21:42:07 CC   Go ahead, IX. This is Carnarvon.
       21:42:09 C    Okay, Carnarvon. We're in position with them.
                     We have 18 percent fuel remaining.
       21:42:15 CC   Roger.
       21:42:16 C    And what's our status now on EVA?
       21:42:21 CC   Stand by one.
       21:42:33 C    Carnarvon, Gemini IX.
       21:42:39 CC   Go ahead, IX.
       21:42:41 C    It's going to take us a lot of fuel to stay here
                     for EVA for three hours.
       21:42:44 CC   Roger. Understand. Stand by one. I'll talk to
                     Flight.
       21:43:15 CC   Gemini IX, Carnarvon.
       21:43:17 C    Go ahead, Carnarvon.
       21:43:19 CC   We'd like you to go ahead and stationkeep until
                     you get to the States and we'll brief you over
                     the States, and go ahead and continue with your
                     EVA preparation.
       21:43:30 C    Good.
       21:43:56 CC   Gemini IX, Carnarvon.
       21:44:03  C    We don't have a chance to do anything for a little
                     bit here.
       21:44:07 CC  Okay. Well, we're standing by here if you want
                     to start the purge.
       21:44:10 C    Okay. I'll go purge them.
       21:44:42 CC   Gemini IX, Carnarvon. Would you turn off the L-Band
                    radar?
       21:44:48 C    Roger. You mean our L-Band?

	Page 130

             21:44:52 CC   Okay.
             21:44:55 C   Are you talking about our L-Band?
             21:45:01 CC  That's affirmative.
             21:45:06 C    It's OFF.
             21:45:53 C    Carnarvon, Gemini IX. Are we still in contact?
             21:45:56 CC  That's affirmative.
             21:45:58 C    It appears I've got about 17 percent fuel.
             21:46:01 CC  Roger.
             21:46:02 C   And we're going to go through a lot of it stationkeeping
                          during 3 hours. Would you pass that on
                          to Flight?
             21:46:10 CC  We copy.
             21:46:11 CC  Will you last?
             21:46:12 C   Roger. Now that we look at the problem, this is
                          going to take quite a bit of fuel to stationkeep
                          here for three hours, compared to the EVA.
             21:46:20 CC  Roger. We understand.
             21:46:22 C   Better delete from our preparation period ...
             21:46:26 CC  Roger.
             21:46:38 CC  IX, Carnarvon. We'd like you to go ahead with
                          your eat period and minimize your usage of the
                          fuel. We'll talk to you over the States.
             21:49:27 CC  Gemini IX, Carnarvon.
             21:49:30 C   Go ahead, Carnarvon.
            21:49:31 CC   Would you place your Quantity Read to ECS O<sub>2</sub>?
            21:49:58 CC   FUEL CELL O<sub>2</sub>.
            21:50:10 CC   FUEL CELL H<sub>2</sub>.
	Page 131

      21:50:23 CC   Quantity Read to OFF and we're standing by.
                         CANTON ISLAND
      22:04:57 CC   Gemini IX, this is Houston.
      22:05:01 C    Roger, Houston. How do you read?
      22:05:06 C    Houston, Gemini IX.
      22:05:08 CC   Roger. We're reading you loud with a little
                   garble. Advise we'd like to look at your stationkeeping
                   between here and the States to see what
                   your fuel consumption does. Like to have your
                   evaluation of how you think you will be able to
                   do stationkeeping and EVA preparation at the same
                   time.
      22:05:32 C    Okay. We both just finished talking it over.
                   Right now we're both pretty well bushed. But I'm
                   afraid it would be against my judgement to go ahead
                   and do the EVA at this time. We've got about,
                   I'd estimate about 16 or 17 percent fuel remaining
                   and if we did all the experiments which we have
                   planned and everything else, Gene and I talked it
                   over, and we think it might be better for both of
                   us to knock it off for awhile. Do some experiments
                   and try in the morning, unless you have a
                   specific plan with the ATDA out here where we can
                   do some good with it. I don't see where we can
                   gain a whole lot. Over.
      22:06:17 CC   Roger. Tom. I followed that. Probably - we're
                   about two minutes to LOS. We'll be talking to
                   you here at the States. We have acquisition at
                   22:23.
      22:06:35 C    Roger. 22:23. I think we might be able to stretch
                   it on fuel with the shortage and do some experiments
                   later ... and if we could accomplish some
                   specific task I'd say GO. We're also - both of us
                   are pretty well beat out at this time.
      22:06:50 CC   Okay. We'll see you in about 15 minutes.

          22:22:26 CC   Gemini IX, Houston.
          22:22:28 C    Gemini IX. Go.
          22:22:31 CC   Roger. It's the Ground recommendation that we
                        postpone the EVA activity until the third day.
                        Would you agree with that?
          22:22:42 C    We concur very heartily with that recommendation.
          22:22:47 CC   Roger. Good. The next thing we'd like to do is
                        fire up the ATDA A-ring during this stateside
                        pass and cycle the rates and the cone. Would you
                        be in a position to observe and photograph that
                        activity?
          22:23:06 C    Roger. We're headed on the stateside pass and
                        I'm in the sunrise right now, Neil. My camera
                        is all set up; be able to follow the whole works.
          22:23:14 CC   All right. We'd like to have a word from you
                        when you think the lighting will be satisfactory
                        and you're in a good position to begin that
                        activity.
          22:23:27 C    Okay.
          22:24:47 P    Houston, this is Gemini IX.
          22:24:49 CC   Go ahead.
          22:24:51 P    Were you able to find out, Neil, whether there is
                        anything we could do EVA to the TDA that might
                        afford us some docking?
          22:24:59 CC  We've looked into it rather extensively and we had
                        some possible action. However, we did not have a
                        very high confidence level in this action.
          22:25:13 P    Tom and I discussed this whole thing and I guess
                       the real little real-time evaluation of what we
                       have done in the past 20 hours or so and what we've
                       got to do leads us to believe probably that the
                       third day EVA might be better.

      22:25:28 CC   Roger. We're in agreement with that at this
                    point, and we're continuing the flight planning
                    activity in that direction.
      22:25:35 P    That's better.
                          TEXAS
      22:27:24 CC   IX, we're over about the middle of Texas pass.
                    Now we're standing by for your recommendation.
      22:27:31 C    Okay. We're set to photograph - go ahead and
                    turn on the RCS if you want to.
      22:27:38 CC   Okay. We'll let you know as we do each action
                    here.

                         HOUSTON

      22:28:39 CC   IX, Houston standing by here. We're waiting for
                    telemetry from the ATDA. Should have it squared
                    away in a second.
      22:28:48 C    Roger.
      22:29:38 CC   Selecting RCS A now.
      22:29:41 C    Roger.
      22:29:48 C    We're taking pictures.
      22:30:07 C    Neil, same thing happened, same drift rates.
      22:30:10 CC   Okay.
      22:30:56 C    It still has the same rates, Neil.
      22:30:59 CC   Okay. We're still about a few seconds away, I
                    guess. Hope we don't run you out of film.
      22:31:16 CC   RCS power ON.
      22:31:27 C    Hurry up. Let's stop it right away. ...

	Page 134

              22:31:34  C     Now it's stopped.
              22:31:36  CC    Roger.
              22:31:41  C     Looks like it's pretty well damped.
              22:31:42  CC    Roger.
              22:31:53  C     Right away it starts drifting now. You turned it
                              ON and OFF. Now it's started to roll to the left;
                              estimate about two degrees per second, maybe three.
              22:32:01  CC    Roger.
              22:32:04  C     Give us the Mark when you turn it on.
              22:32:05  CC    Okay.
              22:32:13  CC    Okay. Go into high-rate.
              22:32:32  C     I didn't see it fire there at all.
              22:32:35  CC    Okay.
              22:32:46  C     We're still in low rate, Neil.
              22:32:48  CC    Okay.
              22:32:51  CC    High rate.
              22:32:53  CC    MARK.
              22:32:57  C     There it goes. It's really kicking up through
                              RCS, Neil.
              22:33:00  CC    Roger.
              22:33:07  CC    Okay. We're going to cycle the nose cone now.
              22:33:10  C     Okay.
              22:33:17  C     Let us know when you cycle it.
              22:33:22  CC    Okay. We're coming up on Rigidize.
              22:33:39  C     Thrusters are still continuing to fire quite a
                              lot. We're just about regular reentry, Neil.

	Page 135

          22:33:45     CC      Okay.  Rigidize.
          22:33:50     C       Oh, they're really tossing the thruster fuel out
                               now.
          22:34:08     C       Those thrusters are firing just about ... pretty
                               good duty cycle.
          22:34:14     CC      We're with you.
          22:34:17     C       Now they're still firing.
          22:34:31     CC      Okay. We're going to Unrigidize now.
          22:34:35     C       Stand by to reload the film.
          22:34:45     C       Go ahead.
          22:34:59     C       Hold off. We're right in the sun now.
          22:35:03     CC      Okay. We're going to lose the carrier here pretty
                               soon.
          22:35:21     C       Okay.  Go ahead now.  Look at those thrusters.
                               Those thrusters are really going through a rapid
                               duty cycle, at least of 50-50.
          22:35:34     CC      Go into low rate now?
          22:35:56     C       He should be out of RCS fuel before long.
          22:36:09     CC      Okay. We're getting T/M dropout now.
          22:36:13     C       Do you want to set us up for a Separation Maneuver
                               from it?
          22:36:18     CC      Stand by.
          22:36:21     C       Do you want us to stationkeep for another revolution?
          22:36:23     C       I've got about 12 percent fuel.
          22:36:26     CC      Okay. We're going to be at Canary in a few
                               minutes. We'll give you that dope there. What's
                               your Propellant Quantity now?
	Page 136

            22:36:31 C    Roger. 12 percent, about 12 to 13 percent.
            22:36:34 CC   Okay. Tom.
            22:36:39 C    Man! Those RCS thrusters are still firing real
                          rapidly.
            22:36:42 CC   Okay.
            22:37:01 CC   We lost T/M but we're going ahead and sending RCS
                          OFF.
            22:37:05 C    Roger.
            22:37:11 CC   Tell us if you see it stop firing.
            22:37:12 C    It stopped.
            22:37:14 CC   Okay.
            22:38:35 CC   Okay. We're approaching LOS at Bermuda, Tom.
                          Canaries will pick you up in three to four minutes.
            22:38:40 C    Roger.
            22:42:47 CC   Gemini IX, Canary CAP COM.
            22:42:51 C    Roger, Canary. We're about 3 feet away from the
                          Monster taking some pictures. Go ahead.
            22:42:55 CC   Okay. We'd like for you to do a 3-foot-per-eecond
                          Retrograde Maneuver at your convenience and give
                          us the time, please.
             22:43:03 C   Roger. We're still snapping pictures.
             22:43:06 CC  Okay. We're standing by. All systems look good.
             22:43:16 P   Except the one we're taking a picture of!
             22:44:43 C   Canary, this is IX here. We're going to have
                          plenty of documentary evidence of what caused the
                          failure.
             22:44:47 CC  Say again, IX?
             22:44:49  C   Roger. We're going to have plenty of documentary

	Page 137

                   evidence as to what caused the failure.
      22:44:54 CC   Roger. We're in the process right now of turning
                   the L-Band ON for you.
      22:44:57 C   Okay.
      22:45:11 CC   Gemini IX, we'd like for you to conserve as much
                    fuel as you can from here on out and we'll update
                    you later on the flight time.
      22:45:21 C    Okay. We are slowly drifting away from it and
                    after we get squared away and finish our pictures
                    here I won't use any more fuel. We'll go ahead
                    and do 3-foot-per-second Retrograde.
      22:45:30 CC   Roger. Copy.
      22:53:57 CC   Gemini IX, Houston. Standing by.
      22:53:59 C    Roger. We're getting squared away for our 3-foot-per-second
                    Retrograde Burn. We've still got him
                    in sight, exposed a lot of film, and hope to give
                    you a call over Carnarvon or Tananarive.
      22:54:12 CC   Roger. We're standing by. Ail we need is the
                    time and velocity of the burn.
      22:54:16 C    Roger.
      23:02:47 C    Hello, Houston. Gemini IX.
      23:02:58 C    Hello, Houston. This is Gemini IX.
      23:03:11 CC   Gemini IX, Houston standing by.
      23:03:12 C    Roger. This is Gemini IX. We're making a 3-foot-per-second
                    at 59:00.
      23:03:25 CC   IX, Houston. Say again the time, please.
      23:03:31 C    Roger. 22:59:00.
      23:03:56 CC   Gemini IX, Houston. Copied the Separation Maneuver
                    at 22:59:00. Is that affirmative?
      23:04:06 C    That is affirmative.

	Page 138

            23:04:09 CC  Roger. Was that a 3-foot-per-second Retrograde?
            23:04:13 C   Yes.
            23:04:15 CC  Roger.
            23:04:17 C   This is Gemini IX. Say again.
            23:04:24 CC  Gemini IX, Houston. Understand that was a 3-foot-per-second
                         Retrograde Burn. Is that affirmative?
            23:04:31 C   That is affirmative.
            23:04:33 CC  Roger, Tom. Anticipate when we come across the
                         States in the next pass that we'll do an Accelerometer
                         Bias Check all the way across the States.
                         We will take a good look at it. So you can prepare
                         for it even before you get there and you can
                         let it run all the way across.
            23:04:53 C   Roger. Will do.
            23:05:06 C    ... Re-Rendezvous for 24-hour period between the
                         retros.
            23:05:20 CC  Gemini IX, Houston. We're having a little trouble
                         reading you. Say again, please.

                               CARNARVON

            23:18:02 CC  Gemini IX, Carnarvon CAP COM. We're standing by.
            23:18:05 C   Roger, Carnarvon. We're just getting squared away
                         here in the cockpit.
            23:18:10 CC  Roger.
            23:18:12 C   We are through with all our Bias Check across the
                         States and our computer's all set up.
            23:18:16 CC   Okay.
            23:18:29 CC   On that 3-foot-per-second burn, which thrusters
                         did you use?

	Page 139

       23:18:34 C   Roger. We used the forward-firing Numbers 11 and
                    12.
       23:18:38 CC   Roger. We copy.

                           GUAYMAS

       23:56:07 CC   Gemini IX, Houston.
       23:56:09 C    Houston, Gemini IX.
       23:56:11 CC   Roger, IX. We're standing by for Accelerometer
                     Bias Check all the way across.
       23:56:16 C    Roger. I have Address 25, 26 and 27 all zero and
                     pushing START COMP.
       23:56:22 CC   Roger. Just let it go and no thrusting and we'll
                     watch it. I have a Flight Plan update for you.
       23:56:29 C    Roger.
       23:56:32 CC   Roger. Node: Ascending Node; Rev 15; 158.6 west.
                     And your Flight Plan update for the next couple of
                     revolutions - we're going to give you an eat
                     period starting right now, at your convenience,
                     and give you a couple of revolutions of rest and
                     we'll pick you up at the end of Rev 17, beginning
                     Rev 18 over the States again.
       23:57:08 CC   Roger. Sounds good. What time will that be?
       23:57:13 CC   Roger. We'll pick you at - Hawaii time at the
                     end of Rev 17 is 26:52. It will be approximately
                     27:10, 27:15.
       23:57:27 C    Sounds real good. We want to get a little snooze
                     here and eat some for awhile.
       23:57:33 CC   Okay. While we're watching this Bias Check we'd
                     also like to brief you on crossfeeds. We want to
                     open the crossfeed now and see if this will balance
                     those tanks; we can close the crossfeed at the
                     beginning of EVA in the morning and we will not
                     have to open it up again. So if we do it now,
                     we'll be all set for the rest of the flight.

	Page 140

             23:58:03  C     Roger. You want to go ahead and open it at this
                             time.
             23:58:04  CC   Well, I'll just go ahead and read the procedures
                             to you. Quantity Read switch to FUEL CELL O<sub>2</sub>.
             23:58:11  C     Roger. FUEL CELL O<sub>2</sub>.
             23:58:14  CC    Okay. G and R Control Bus ON switch to EXPERIMENT
                             position.
             23:58:20  C     Roger. Bus ON to EXPERIMENT position.
             23:58:22  CC    Crossfeed switch OPEN.
             23:58:26  C     Roger. Crossfeed switch coming OPEN. Then we
                             are to standby.
             23:58:34  CC    Okay. Understand Pyro Fire to Agena Control, Bus
                             Arm switch to SAFE.
             23:58:39  C     Switch to SAFE.

             24:00:19  C     Roger.
             24:00:23  CC    Tom, that's all I have right now for you and we'll
                            watch you going across. You can relax for a while.

	Page 141

       24:00:29 C    All the ... were done on that last rendezvous. I
                     think we learned a whole lot about rendezvous from
                     those last two and also from the first one.
       24:00:37 CC   Yes, I think we all did on those.
       24:00:41 C    That was quite a chore. I'll clue you, on that
                     last one, everything was going real good. Hope
                     we came out okay on it.
       24:00:48 CC   Okay. Real fine. Real glad it happened that way.
       24:00:54 C    But you talk about being busy as a left-handed
                     paper-hanger trying to go optically and also IFR,
                     that was really a chore!
       24:01:00 CC   Yes, well that's nothing new, is it?
       24:01:03 C    No, just like flying the old ...
       24:01:09 CC   Well, it looked like a pretty good show from down
                     here.
       24:01:12 C    Thank you.
       24:01:15 C    Yes. We used our Backup Initiate, which was real
                     close to what the Ground's was. The Closed-Loop
                     was off a little. We could see this from the
                     plots.
       24:01:24 CC   Understand.
       24:01:26 C    This being Closed-Loop would have thrown us in
                     the wrong way. Our Delta, Delta-R shows exactly
                     what we had instantly, and the ground solution
                     was good, and so was our on-board backup. We
                     kept a Closed-Loop and used the modified first
                     Midcourse. We took the backup - the Closed-Loop
                     for the final Midcourse.
       24:01:46 CC   Fine. Sounds good. At least we know how to do
                     them now, don't we?
       24:01:49 C    Yes.
       24:02:05 CC   IX, Houston.

           24:02:06 C    Go ahead.
           24:02:08 CC   Tom, just an overall look here. What we're
                         looking at this afternoon, after you have a couple
                         of revolutions to rest, just pick up some of your
                         experiments, D-14 and S-11's. We can update those
                         later for you, and we'll update them in REAL-TIME
                         for you to do them after your rest period. We're
                         trying to get the EVA tomorrow morning as late
                         as possible, still maintaining stateside coverage
                         so we can give you a good 10-hour rest period tonight
                         before EVA Prep.
           24:02:44 C    That sounds real good. Give us a good accurate
                         Propellant Quantity from the ground readout. I'm
                         showing about 11 percent here.
           24:02:51 CC   Stand by.
           24:04:36 CC   Gemini IX, Houston.
           24:04:38 C    Go ahead.
           24:04:39 CC   Roger. Your On-Board Gage reading agrees with
                         our reading within 1 percent, which means you
                         have approximately 50 pounds of fuel remaining.
           24:04:49 C    Roger.
           24:12:57 CC   Gemini IX, Houston.
           24:12:59 C    Houston, IX. Go.
           24:13:00 CC   Roger. We're about to have LOS in a minute and a
                         half or so and we'll be looking at you while you're
                         taking a little rest here for awhile.
           24:13:10 C    Okay. Do you want the computer OFF, Dick?
           24:13:12 CC   Stand by
           24:13:22 CC   IX, Houston. Roger. You can shut down the computer
                         on normal procedures.
           24:13:29 C    We'll leave the Platform ON.
           24:13:33 CC   Roger. Understand. Tell Gene I'm sorry about his

                     Cubs last night, but we'll try again tonight.
       24:13:39 C    Okay. You know how the Cubs are.
       24:13:43 P    I'll be a winner tomorrow anyway, no matter how
                     you look at it, Dick.
       24:13:46 CC   I'm sure you will.
       24:13:50 P    Yes, try a little harder. I lost 2 out of 2
                     yesterday.
       24:13:54 CC   Say again.
       24:l4:01 P    Yes, the Astros and the Cubs.
       24:14:04 CC   Well, I lost one of them with you, so that's
                     pretty close. Chris said the Yankees won.
       24:14:14 P    Say again.
       24:14:16 CC   The Yankees won yesterday.
       24:14:18 P    Thanks a lot. Who are they?
       24:14:22 CC   You not only got the wrong teams, you got the
                     wrong league.
       24:14:26 P    Yankee who?
       24:14:29 CC   Good night.

                          Lima. That's all.
            26:34:02 P    Okay. We've got three D-14's: one at 26:52:34,
                          Alpha Romeo; 26:16:33, Alpha Romeo.
            26:34:17 CC   Negative.
            26:34:18 P    29:28:25, Alpha Lima.
            26:34:22 CC   Negative.
            26:34:25 CC   The third D-14: 28:28:25, Alpha Lima.
            26:34:31 P    Roger. I have it down as 28:28:25, Alpha Lima.
            26:34:37 CC   And the second one is 27:16:33.
            26:34:43 P    Okay. Gemini IX calling CAP COM.
            26:34:47 CC   Go ahead. Carnarvon.
            26:34:49 CC   The second D-14 is 27:16:33.
            26:34:54 P    Roger. I've got it 27:16:33.
            26:34:58 CC   Roger. Alpha Romeo.
             26:35:01 P   Got it.
             26:35:06 C   Thanks for the rest, it sure helps.
             26:35:09 CC  You're welcome.
             26:37:03 CC  Gemini IX, Carnarvon. 1 minute to LOS.
             26:37:06 C   Roger, Carnarvon. We're Alining the Platform so
                          we can give ... away.

       26:57:10 CC   Gemini IX, Hawaii.
       26:57:12 CC   All systems are GO on the ground and we're
                     standing by.
       26:57:15 C    Roger. We're in the middle of D-14.
       26:57:17 CC   Roger.
       26:57:51 C    Hawaii, Gemini IX.
       26:57:53 CC   Go ahead.
       26:57:55 C    When I go to FUEL CELL H<sub>2</sub>, Quantity, I get the
                     zero.
       26:58:01 CC   Stand by.
       26:58:18 CC   Okay. We're getting the same readout on the
                     ground as that. Our pressure reading is 250,
                     which is normal.
       26:58:29 P    Understand you're getting a zero quantity reading
                     on the ground but a normal pressure reading.
       26:58:32 CC   That's affirm.
       26:58:34 P    Okay. Would you - keep a good look on it.
       26:58:37 CC   Sure will. Why don't you leave it in that position
                     until you get across the States?
       26:58:40 P    Okay.
                          CALIFORNIA
       27:05:12 CC  Gemini IX, Houston.
       27:05:14 C   Houston, Gemini IX.
       27:05:16 CC   Roger. Reading you loud and clear. Understand
                     you want to update your Accelerometer Bias. You

                           can go PRELAUNCH in the computer anytime.
             27:05:30 C    PRELAUNCH. And did Hawaii advise you about our
                           Quantity reading on hydrogen?
             27:05:35 CC   Roger. We're looking at it down here. The
                           pressure looks good - we're also getting a zero
                           reading and we'll look at that over Texas with a
                           calibration test.
             27:05:45 C    Okay.
             27:05:47 CC   I've got a continuous Flight Plan update for you
                           when you're ready to copy.
             27:05:55 P    Go ahead, Neil. Ready to copy.
             27:05:58 CC   Roger. Over the RKV at 29:05 we'll give you a
                           PLA update.
             27:06:07 CC   S-11 at 29:16:27; Sequence Number 01.

             27:07:47 P    Roger. Gemini IX. Had a little pencil trouble
                           on the first three. Would you repeat those three?
             27:07:52 CC   Roger. S-11: 29:16:27, Sequence 01. S-11:
                           29:49:02; Sequence 03. D-14: 30:04:25, Alpha
                           Lima. Over.
             27:08:19 P    Okay. We've got them all, Houston.
             27:08:21 CC   Roger.
             27:08:25 P    And the fuel cells up here are looking real good.
                           No indication other than the Quantity reading zero
                           percent.
	Page 147

       27:08:31 CC   Roger. Understand, the Quantity. The pressure
                     is looking good down here. We'll catch this over
                     Texas in a few seconds.
                         GUAYMAS
       27:10:19 P    Houston, Gemini IX.
       27:10:21 CC   Gemini IX, Houston. Go.
       27:10:23 P    Roger. Just for information - my main batteries
                     read, in order: 21, 24, 22 and 23 both respectively.
       27:10:37 CC   This is Houston. Roger. Copied.
       27:11:02 CC   Gemini IX, Houston.
       27:11:04 P    Go, Houston.
       27:11:06 CC   Roger. Is Quantity Read switch FUEL CELL H<sub>2</sub>?
       27:11:09 P    It's FUEL CELL H<sub>2</sub> at this time.
       27:11:11 CC   Roger. Calibrate Number 1 for 30 seconds.
       27:11:14 P    Operate Number 1 for 30 seconds.

            27:12:32 CC   Roger. Understand 30-second MARK.
            27:12:40 P    Houston, let us know when we can have our computer
                          back. We've got a D-14 coming up.
            27:12:44 CC   Roger. We're leaving PRELAUNCH. We're sending
                          the Accelerometer Bias at this time.
            27:12:54 P    Roger. Received your update.
            27:12:58 CC   Roger. Let us look at it a minute.
            27:13:01 P    Okay. Was that 27:16:33 a good time for D-14?
            27:13:06 CC   Roger. 27:16:33.
            27:13:09 P    Okay.
            27:13:34 CC   Gemini IX, Houston.
            27:13:36 P    Go, Houston.
            27:13:37 CC   Roger. Your Accelerometer Bias update looks good.
                          You can have your computer back.
            27:13:41 P    Thank you.
            27:14:17 CC   Gemini IX, Houston
            27:14:19 P    Go, Houston.
            27:14:21 CC   Roger. On your Fuel Cell H<sub>2</sub>, temperatures and
                          pressures look real good and they are steady. We
                          suspect we may have trouble with a sensor in the
                          tank.
            27:14:31 P    Okay, Dick. Thanks a lot. Do you want us to turn
                          Quantity Read switch to OFF?
            27:14:37 CC   That's affirmative.
            27:14:41 P    Okay. Quantity reads OFF at this time.
            27:14:44 CC   Roger. You may check it from time to time; it
                          may come back in.
            27:14:47 P    Okay.
	Page 149

       27:17:46 C    Houston, Gemini IX. Is D-14 experiment being received?
       27:17:51 CC   Stand by. We received it in Hawaii. Let me
                    check.
       27:22:44 CC   Gemini IX, Houston.
       27:22:48 P    Go ahead, Houston.
       27:22:49 CC   Roger, IX. We can't tell you how the data is
                     being received at Antigua till after the pass.
                    We'll let you know, though, and we'11 have a fuel
                    cell purge at Ascension at approximately 27:33:00.
                    We'll purge Section 2 first. Over.
       27:23:10 P    Roger. Understand. Fuel cell purge at 27:33:00,
                    Section 2 first - I've been alternating these
                    sections, by the way, on the purges.
       27:23:18 CC   Roger. Understand.
       27:23:21 P    And I see by that last experiment update you're
                    watching out for your favorite 11 group.
       27:23:26 CC   Yes sir. Lots of those.
               CC   Gemini IX, Houston.
               P    Go ahead, Houston.
               CC   Roger. We're thirty seconds to LOS and we did
                    get good data at Antigua on D-14.
               P    Say you did get good data?
               CC   That's affirmative.
               P    Good.
       27:33:20 CC   Gemini IX, Houston. We're standing by for your
                     fuel cell purge.
       27:36:22 CC   Gemini IX, Houston.
       27:36:24 C    Houston. Go.

            27:36:26 CC   Roger, Tom. How's the fuel cell purge looking?
            27:36:29 C    Say again.
            27:36:31 CC   How is the fuel cell purge going?
            27:36:34 C    Great!
            27:36:38 CC   Roger. Understand.

            27:52:28 C    Gemini IX. Go.
            27:52:30 CC   Roger. Tom. We're just standing by on this
                          pass. We have nothing for you.
            27:52:32 C    We're getting ready to do the D-14 over Hawaii.
            27:52:36 CC   Roger. Understand.

            28:05:41 CC   Gemini IX, Carnarvon CAP COM. We have nothing
                          for you this pass. We'll be standing by.
            28:05:47 C    Roger. Carnarvon.
            28:06:03 CC   We do have one question for you, Tom.
            28:06:05 C    Shoot.
            28:06:06 CC   The local folks down here are wondering if you
                          had a chance to see much of Australia?
            28:06:11 C    No. Not really. It's been pretty much looking at
                          other things - the ATDA on the rendezvous and it's
                          been kind of cloudy, too.
            28:06:19 CC   Roger.
	Page 151

       28:06:24 C    You had a few thunderstorms around here; we could
                    tell that.
       28:06:26 CC   Yes. Tonight was the first time we've had rain
                    in about nine months.
       28:06:30 C    Yes. We could see the lightning down there.
       28:06:35 P    Say Bill, how did they get you off your favorite
                    boat and into Australia?
       28:06:37 CC   Well, I used to put you guys to bed all the time,
                     so now they let me wake you up.
       28:06:47 C    Sorry about that 2-week delay.
       28:06:52 CC   Yes. It's pretty rough down here.
       28:10:51 CC   Gemini IX, Carnarvon. We've one minute to LOS.
       28:10:55 C    Gemini IX.
       28:10:57 CC   We'll see you tomorrow.
       28:10:59 C    Roger.

                          HAWAII

       28:33:36 CC   Gemini IX, Hawaii. We're receiving your D-14
                     data and it looks real good.
       28:33:40 C    Gemini IX. Roger. Thank you.
       28:38:39 CC   Gemini IX, Hawaii. We're 30 seconds to LOS and
                     standing by.
       28:38:43 C    Gemini IX.
       28:40:25 CC   Gemini IX, Houston.
       28:40:27 C    Houston, Gemini IX.
       28:40:29 CC   Roger, Tom. Looks like we have another good pass
                     at Hawaii for D-14.

	Page 152

              28:40:34 C     Roger.

              28:40:36 CC    I have a sequence change to one of your S-11's
                             when you're ready to copy.

              28:40:40 C     Okay. Stand by.

              28:40:46 C     Go.

              28:40:48 CC    Roger. The S-11 at 30:46:45: make the Sequence
                             01. Over.

              28:40:58 C     Roger. Got it.

              28:41:02 CC    Okay. We've been looking at your water down here
                             a little bit. And ECOM tells me that we are
                             losing a little bit of nitrogen out of the gas
                             pressure of the Fuel Cell Regulation System.
                             There is not a problem. Surgeon said you can
                             stand to drink a little more of it. You might
                             start tapping it a little bit if you'd like.

              28:41:25 C     Okay. We thought we did a pretty good job
                             drinking on it. We'll go ahead and concentrate
                             on drinking.

              28:41:32 CC    Okay. We'll watch here. I think if you take a
                             little over a long period of time it would be the
                             best way to do it.

              28:41:38 C     Roger.

              28:41:41 CC    And I've got a G and C status here for you if
                             you're interested in all that. We've got down
                             here - it looks like as far as the OAMS are con-
                             cerned - fuel remaining is 48 pounds, oxidizer
                             remaining is about 78. On-board gage should read
                             about 11 percent and usable fuel gives us about
                             82 pounds. This is plenty of OAMS for Attitude
                             Control for the rest of the flight plan.

              28:42:05 C     Real good.

              28:42:08 CC    On the computer, it seems to us down here that
                             it's working normally at this time. Accelerometer
                             Bias update was good. It's almost perfect at this
                             time. That START COMP problem we had after the

	Page 153

                     first rendezvous - during the first rendezvous,
                     has not reappeared and we think that problem may
                     have been either in the START COMP button or in
                     the Electronic Latch Internal of the computer.

       28:42:35 C    Okay. Roger. It hasn't shown up since the first
                     day.

       28:42:40 CC   Okay. We do have a procedure for you when you
                     load Module 5. We'll play that just at 25, 26 and
                     27 and we think we may be able to correct it in
                     case it shows up, but we'll brief you on this
                     when we load Module 4.

       28:42:56 C    Roger. Module 4. I thought you said 5 at first.

       28:43:00 CC   I think I did but I meant 4.

       28:43:02 C    Roger.

       28:43:04 CC   Okay. All other G and C systems look real good.
                     Temperatures, pressures and voltages are all real
                     fine.

       28:43:10 C    Okay, Dick. It's still warm here if we do any
                     activity. So far we're running both suit fans.

       28:43:16 CC   Okay. Understand. As far as the ECON status is
                     concerned, PCM tape recorder has now functioned
                     in the Playback mode. What we'll do with that
                     thing, we'll just leave it; looks like it's the
                     beginning of the tape. We'll leave it off until
                     just prior to EVA tomorrow morning. Hope that we
                     may be able to get some AMU data on it.

       28:43:38 C    Roger. Real fine. Thank you.

       28:43:42 CC   And your Fuel Cell H<sub>2</sub> Quantity tape sensor looks
                     like it is gone. Everything else concerning that
                     looks okay. We're going to calculate hydrogen
                     quantity from amp hours and keep you posted on
                     that one.

       28:43:57 C     Okay. The last we saw of it, Dick, we were real
                     good. We were way up over 87 percent this morning.

       28:44:03 CC    Okay. It doesn't look to us like there are any

	Page 154

                        leaks. The system integrity looks good and we
                        really think it is a sensor in that case. Looks
                        like your stacks in the section are storing load
                        real well up there.
           28:44:17 C    Right.
           28:44:18 CC   Okay. And coolant loops -- both of them look
                        real good and I understand you are on both A
                        pumps at this time to keep a little cool.
            28:44:25 C   That's affirmative.
            28:44:27 CC  Okay. That's really all that we have here at
                         this time. We'll be standing by.
            28:44:31 C   Roger.

                               GUAYMAS

            28:45:03 CC  IX, Houston.
            28:45:05 C   Houston, IX.
            28:45:07 CC  Roger. How about putting your Quantity Read
                         switch to ECS O<sub>2</sub>.
            28:45:13 C    ... Go. We have a reading of about 65 - 64 1/2
                         percent.
            28:45:19 CC  Roger. Understand you're reading 64-1/2 percent.
            28:45:52 CC  Gemini IX, Houston. Go to FUEL CELL O<sub>2</sub>.
            28:45:57 C   FUEL CELL O<sub>2</sub>.
            28:46:33 CC  Gemini IX, Houston. Go to FUEL CELL HYDROGEN.
            28:46:39 C   FUEL CELL HYDROGEN.
            28:47:03 CC  Gemini IX, Houston. You can go to Quantity Read,
                          OFF. Everything looks good down here.
            28:47:09 C    Quantity Read to OFF. Could you give us the
                         latest GET hack?

	Page 155

       28:47:14 CC   Roger. I'll give you a hack at 28:47:20.
       28:47:20 CC   MARK. 20.
       28:47:24 P    Roger. We're right on.
       28:47:26 CC   Okay. Have a Flight Plan update for you.
       28:47:31 P    Go.
       28:47:37 P    Go ahead, Dick.
       28:47:39 CC   Roger. At CSQ at 32:59:00, we'll expect a crew
                     status report; you'll have a fuel cell purge, and
                     a Cryo Quantity readout again.
       28:48:01 C    When's this, Dick?
       28:48:03 CC   At CSQ, at 32:59:00.
       28:48:08 C    Roger. 32:59:00.
       28:48:11 CC   Roger. Than at 33:30:00 you power-down; at
                     33:30 to 34:30 have an eat period and from 34:30
                     to 44:30 sleep period. Over.
       28:48:35 C    Roger. Power-down at 32:59:00 and ... yes, we've
                     got all the other ones. Sleep period started at
                     44 - from 34:30 to 44:30.
       28:48:50 CC   Roger. And that power-down was at 33:30, and
                     your crew status at CSQ at 32:59.
       28:48:57 C    Roger.
       28:48:58 CC   Okay.
       28:49:29 C    Houston, Gemini IX.
       28:49:32 CC   IX, Houston. Go.
       28:49:34 C    Roger. We'd like to stay powered-up for about 15
                     minutes after the initial power-down and complete
                     D-14. We could do a better job with everything
                     up.
       28:49:53 CC   Roger. Understand the D-14 at 33:15:34.

	Page 156

             28:50:01 C   Roger.
             28:50:02 CC  Roger. I agree with that.
             28:50:17 CC  IX, Houston.
             28:50:19 C   Go ahead.
             28:50:22 CC  Roger, Tom. We didn't have you powering down
                          until 33:30 which is 15 minutes after your last
                          D-14.
             28:50:29 C   Okay. Right. We've got it.
             28:50:31 CC  Okay.
             29:00:03 CC  Gemini IX, Houston. We're one minute LOS Antigua.

       29:08:26 C   Roger. Out.
       29:08:32 CC  Roger. We have nothing further for you, Gemini

             29:13:37 C    Read you five-by-five with a lot of background
                           noise. We're starting S-11.
             29:13:46 CC   Gemini IX, Houston. Roger. Read you loud and
                           clear.
             29:13:52 C    Roger. This should be interesting, we have a
                           full moon right over the horizon.
             29:13:57 CC   Roger. I understand. Full moon on the horizon.
                           We'll be watching you.
             29:14:03 P    Notice how much I yaw, and watch this go off
                           about 30 degrees ...
             29:14:12 C    I've got sunshine coming back. Sunset still
                           hitting me over here.
             29:14:23 C    30 degrees. Let me know when you want to stop
                           the rates.
             29:14:29 P    Boy, the cockpit position is so terrible! I
                           can't get - I can't get down any further.
             29:14:34 P    Going to be about - -
             29:14:39 C    How far?
             29:14:41 P    - - almost.
             29:14:43 C    ... around from here.
             29:14:45 P    ... we're going ... here.
             29:14:49 C    We're over at 300 ... You want me to stop the
                           yaw?
             29:14:52 C    You want me to stop the yaw for you?
             29:14:55 P    Yes. Stop the yaw.
             29:15:13 P    Okay, Tom.
             29:15:15 P    Hold our yaw ...

	Page 159

       29:15:30 C    Okay. Use the filter to start with.
       29:15:44 P    I guess this is going to be a long process. Boy,
                     oh boy!
       29:15:53 P    Thirty ...
       29:16:07 P    MARK.
       29:16:14 P    Hold the rate right there.
       29:16:16 C    Okay.
       29:16:23 P    Okay. I'll fix your ... now okay, pal.
       29:16:26 C    Ready.
       29:16:27 P    Stand by.
       29:16:28 P    Mark it.
       29:16:29 C    Ready. Go.
       29:16:30 P    Stand by.
       29:16:31 C    Hold it. Go.
       29:16:45 C    15 seconds.
       29:16:50 C    Mark it.
       29:16:51 C    20.
       29:17:06 C    Okay.
       29:17:08 P    Still one clip left.
       29:17:11 P    Okay. Stand by.
       29:17:13 P    Mark it.
       29:17:15 C    Go for 5.
       29:17:20 C    MARK.
       29:17:21 P    Stand by - -

             29:17:24 P   - - one clip left.
             29:17:28 C   MARK. 1001, 1002.
             29:17:31 C   MARK.
             29:17:32 C   Okay. Now the sun is still shining out on the
                          left.
             29:17:36 P   Well, go ahead and yaw over there.
             29:17:39 C   That would ... we'll take a good look at 240
                          degrees. I'll tell you what - you can pitch
                          down about 25 degrees.
             29:17:50 P   Boy, this cockpit position is terrible! Back her
                          around 90 degrees, Tom.
             29:18:07 C   Sun's going down pretty rapidly. We'll go around
                          to 240.
             29:18:13 P   I should be able to take a picture.
             29:19:14 C   We're getting close to it.
             29:19:20 P   Okay. Roll left a little bit.
             29:19:35 P   ...
             29:19:44 C   Seems to be the reverse process, right?
             29:19:46 P   ... I better pull it around ...
             29:19:52 C   I have damped the rates just a little.
             29:19:59 P   Pitch down a little bit here.
             29:20:09 C   See anything out the window, Gene?
             29:20:16 P   Okay. Stand by.
             29:20:19 C   Yes.

       29:20:22 C    1001, 1002.
       29:20:23 P    Stop.
       29:20:27 C    Okay. Ready for the next one.
       29:20:28 P    Yes.

       29:21:09 P    Little more.
       29:21:33 P    ...
       29:21:35 C    Okay.
       29:21:40 C    Get the roll up.
       29:21:43 C    Ready.

       29:22:10 C    Left again?
       29:22:11 P    Okay. Yes, left again.
       29:22:14 C    We go from 240 back to 150.
       29:22:24 P    150?

              29:22:26 C    150.
              29:22:37 C    It's kind of a dirty brown the way that thing
                            looks out there.
              29:22:40 P    Yes.
              29:22:42 C    White and yellow on top.
              29:23:14 C    Do you have to be done at any particular time?
                            You know, we can take our time going around.
              29:23:17 P    No. We have to be there for sunrise ...
              29:23:21 C    Back where we started?
              29:23:23 P    ... have to be there for one or ... No, that's

              29:25:29 P    Pitch down and ... roll right.

       29:27:16 C    Roger. We're going through a little bit of a
                     gymnastic here with S-11.
       29:27:20 CC   Roger. Understand.
       29:27:21 CC   Okay.
       29:27:29 P    Boy, think I'd rather patch this darn box ...
       29:27:30 P    Roll left ... yaw right.

       29:28:32 C    Okay. I'll get the rate scaling. Rate check yaw
                     for 5 seconds.
       29:28:40 P    Okay.

                           trying to do this and it just doesn't work ...
                           operation.

             29:30:06 C    60 degrees.
             29:30:08 P    Right. 50 or 60?
             29:30:15 C    Yes. This experiment takes much more fuel than
                           I think people orginally thought, because of the

             29:30:51 P    By the way ... our thruster ...
             29:31:13 C    How are we doing on pitch?
             29:31:14 P    We're still coming down. Give it a roll right.

                                         anything for you this pass, except one question.
                                         If you can recall when you closed the S-12 door,
                                         do you have any idea how long that door was run-
                                         ning before it closed? Over.

                30:16:56         C       No, we couldn't hear it operate, either open or
                                         closed.
                30:17:01         P       ... it's not locked.
                30:17:03         P       ... Did he say that?
                30:17:05         C       Yes. It just now locked. We'll get more data
                                         on it tonight.
                30:17:08         CC      All right. I have another question on opening
                                         that up again, if it took longer than 30 seconds
                                         to close. I doubt if you could estimate that.
                30:17:18         C       When did you close the door?
                30:17:24         P       Just left it closed; just put it closed and left
                                         it.

            30:17:28  C    Next one is what, one of yours?
            30:17:29  P    Yes. 30:46, Tom.
            30:17:32  P    01 again. Same thing. One of yours and one of
                           mine and one of yours.
            30:17:38  C    Put the ... around 30 degrees. It won't even go
                           around to 360 when we come back.
            30:17:41  P    Okay.
            30:17:47  C    It looks like ... all kinds of cheese dropped
                           down there, doesn't it?
            30:17:49  P    Boy! Sure does, doesn't it?
            30:18:09  CC   Gemini IX, Houston. I have a nodal update for
                           you, if you are ready to copy.

            30:19:08  C    What was the time for that dude?

                             HOUSTON

        44:54:11  CC   Gemini IX, Houston. Did you take any water at all?
        44:54:16  C    ... We've got a little problem with the water build-
                       ing up. What does your counter read?
        44:54:22  C    Stand by, Neil.
        44:54:24  C    2472, 02472.
        44:54:31  CC   Okay. Well, we're going to have you - have you
                       taken any water at all out this morning?
        44:54:51  C    We started drinking - just started drinking now.
        44:55:02  CC   Well, we're going to have to dump some water. Our
                       suggestion here is to dump it through the water
                       boiler. We have a procedure we're ready to give
                       you when you're ready to copy.
        44:55:17  C    Okay.
        44:55:32  CC   What it amounts to is dumping about 2 pounds of
                       water, which is 66 counts on the gun.
        44:55:42  C    Go ahead with the procedure, Neil.

	Page 176

           44:55:43 CC  Okay. We want to put the Radiator to BYPASS now.
           44:55:51 C   Okay.
           44:55:53 CC  Okay. Then your Water valve and Condensate valve
                        in NORMAL, which I expect is where they are.
           44:56:03 C   Roger. Both in NORMAL.
           44:56:06 CC  Okay. Then we'll want to squirt out, using the
                        water gun, into the M5 receptacle and put the
                        Waste valve in EVAP.
           44:56:33 C   Roger. Put the water gun to the M5 receptacle and
                        put the Waste valve to EVAP.
           44:56:38 CC  Roger. Then put the Selector valve on the M5
                        collector to BYPASS and shoot 66 clicks of the
                        water gun in there and see how much you bounce
                        around inside the cabin.
           44:57:14 CC  Another thing we'd like to have you do, when you
                        get a chance, is close the S-12 doors.
           44:57:20 C   We just closed them.
           44:58:38 CC  Gemini IX, Houston. We've got a Flight Plan update
                        for you when you're ready to copy. I don't
                        mean to get you too busy here, but let me know.
                        We've got about 10 minutes yet before we lose
                        contact.
           44:58:54 C   Okay.
           44:59:04 CC  Let us know when you start clicking the gun, too.
           44:59:07 C   Roger. We already started clicking the gun.
           44:59:10 CC  Roger. You're clicking it now?
           44:59:11 C   Roger.
           44:59:12 CC  Okay. I'm trying to watch your pressure down
                        here.
           44:59:37 C   Okay, Neil. Ready to copy.

                     44:48:09; Remarks: Rev 28, 121.7 west; right
                     ascension, 19 hours 14 minutes; time of 45:11.
                     At Canary is the crew status report, PLA update,
                     fuel cell purge.
        45:00:39 C   Got it.
        45:00:40 CC  Okay. At 45:30: EVA preparation start.
        45:00:53 C   Okay.
        45:00:54 CC  At 46:28, we'll have a GO/NO-GO for 46-1.
        45:01:07 C   Roger. Good.
        45:01:08 CC  At 48:58: GO/NO-GO for depressurization.
        45:01:23 C   Roger.
        45:01:24 CC  And your sunrise time, Tom, is 49:26:34.
        45:01:34 C   Roger. 49:26:34: for sunrise and depressurization.
        45:01:40 CC  That's right.
        45:02:08 CC  Now if you can drink some more water or put some
                     in some water bags there, why it'll probably help
                     the margin we've got for the next 4 or 5 hours.
        45:02:20 C   Roger.
        45:02:55 C   We've done 25 clicks into the water boiler.
        45:02:59 CC  Roger.
        45:03:00 C   And I'm bringing the Spacecraft to a stabilized
                     position, which should help eat it up.
        45:03:07 CC  Okay. You do have your Radiator in BYPASS, don't
                     you?
        45:03:10 C   Affirmative.
        45:03:11 CC  Okay.
        45:03:13 C   And we added evaporate pressure right on top of

	Page 178

                       evaporate ...
          45:03:18 CC  Okay. That's good.
          45:04:40 CC  Want to remind you here too, Tom, that over the
                       Canaries in about 10 minutes - 6 to 10 minutes -
                       they'll be giving you a PLA update. You might
                       make sure you've got that right book out.
          45:05:51 C   And we still have the Evaporator Pressure valve
                       OPEN, and I've got the heat to it.
          45:05:57 CC  Okay, Tom. We're expecting it. How many clicks
                       are you up to?
          45:06:03 C   39.
          45:06:04 CC  39?
          45:06:08 C   Roger. 40 now.
          45:06:09 CC  Okay.
          45:07:42 CC  Okay. We're about to lose you here, Tom. Let's
                       stop wherever you are and get a gun count.
          45:07:53 C   We're at 47 clicks. The digits are 2530.
          45:07:57 CC  Okay. Your last reading 2530?
          45:08:02 CC  Okay. Canaries will have you here in 4 or 5 minutes.
          45:08:08 C   You want us to continue on until we get the total
                       load dumped, right?
          45:08:12 CC  No. Let's just leave it go right there. That's
                       good enough.
          45:08:14 C   Roger.

                             CANARY ISLANDS

          45:11:36 CC  Gemini IX, Canary CAP COM.

	Page 179

       45:11:40 C   Canary, IX. Go.
       45:11:41 CC  Roger. Would you put your thermometers in for
                    the oral temp?
       45:13:13 CC  Gemini IX, Canary. We have a valid temp on both.
                    Would you place your Radiator to FLOW?
       45:13:21 C   FLOW?
       45:13:22 CC  Roger.
       45:13:26 C   I'm standing by for the PLA update.
       45:13:28 CC  Roger. We'd also like your water management
                    system back to NORMAL configuration and Evaporator
                    Heater OFF.
       45:13:35 C   Evap Heat is OFF.
       45:13:37 CC  Okay, IX. I'll give you the area and the times
                    and then we'll go back for the bank angles and
                    weather.
       45:13:43 P   Roger. Stand by one, please.
       45:13:45 CC  Roger. Standing by.
       45:14:05 CC  Gemini IX, do you still have an EVAPORATOR PRESSURE
                    light?
       45:14:07 C   Negative. It's out and I've got the Heater OFF,
                    but I'm ready to copy.
       45:14:11 CC  Roger.
       45:14:27 CC  Gemini IX. Area 29-1: 44:34:30; 20 plus 48; 26
                    plus 58. Area 30-1: 46:10:02; 20 plus 58; 27 plus
                    09. Area 31-1: 47:44:48; 21 plus 12; 27 plus 38.
                    Area 32-4: 50:37:23; 20 plus 55; 26 plus 50. Area
                    33-4: 52:10 - correction on that - the GET RC is
                    52:12:49; 21 plus 05; 27 plus 18. Area 34-4:
                    53:48:18; 21 plus 12; 27 plus 33. Area 35-3:
                    55:07:29; 20 plus 49; 26 plus 50. Area 36-3:
                    56:42:55; 20 plus 59; 27 plus 07. Area 37-3:
                    58:18:23; 21 plus 13; 27 plus 22. Are you ready
                    for your bank angles?
	Page 180

            45:16:46 C   Go.
            45:16:47 CC  Roger. All the bank angles are as follows: roll
                         left 85, roll right 95. The weather in the following
                         areas is marginal. 30-1, 31-1, 35-3, 36-3
                         and 37-3. There is no Sep Maneuver associated with
                         any of these areas. Do you copy?
            45:17:22 C   Roger. Gemini IX. Would you give me the times
                         again for 29-1 and 30-1, just GET.
            45:17:30 CC  Roger. 29-1: 44:34:30; 30-1: 46:10:02.
            45:17:45 C   Got them all.
            45:17:46 CC  Roger.
            45:17:48 C   Water panel is NORMAL and we're starting to move
                         the Platform up now in Horizon Scan mode.
            45:18:27 CC  Gemini IX, we'd like a food and water report from
                         each crewman.
            45:18:31 C   Stand by.
            45:18:38 C   Okay. Since the last time, we've only had about
                         40 ounces of water and we dumped some in the water
                         boiler and we've had one meal apiece.
            45:18:54 CC  Can you give me a sleep report?
            45:18:57 C   Roger. We had about 4 hours of solid sleep and for
                         about 6 to 8 hours we dozed.
            45:19:06 CC  Roger. Copy.
            45:19:18 CC  You're looking good, Gemini. You can go ahead
                         with your fuel cell purge when you're ready.
            45:19:28 P   Fine. Roger.

                               CARNARVON

            45:48:01 CC  Gemini IX, Carnarvon CAP COM. All systems are GO.
                         Would you place the Quantity Read switch to ECS O<sub>2</sub>?

       45:48:07 P    Gemini IX. Roger.
       45:48:23 CC   FUEL CELL O<sub>2</sub>.
       45:48:37 CC   FUEL CELL H<sub>2</sub>.
       45:49:05 CC   Quantity Read's OFF.
       45:49:13 CC   When you don't have a mouthful up there, we'd like
                     a Prop Quantity readout, when you get a chance.
       45:49:18 C    About 7 percent.
       45:49:19 CC   Okay.
       45:49:20 C    6 to 7 percent.
       45:54:59 P    Roger, Carnarvon.

                         HOUSTON

       46:29:28 CC   Gemini IX, Houston.
       46:29:30 P    Go ahead, Houston.
       46:29:31 CC   Roger, Gene. We're going to go ahead early on this
                     Crossfeed so we can take a look at it across the
                     States. We'll go ahead and close the Crossfeed,
                     with Fuel Cell O<sub>2</sub> Heater OFF, and we'll come back
                     on with that Heater at Carnarvon. We want to watch
                     that pressure, temperature on that for awhile.
       46:29:53 P    Okay. The Fuel Cell O<sub>2</sub> Heater is OFF now and you
                     want the Crossfeed CLOSED. Is that correct?
       46:29:58 CC   That's affirmative.
       46:30:00 P    Okay. It's CLOSED and the Heater is OFF.
       46:30:03 CC   Roger. Got some good news for you. Your Cubs won
                     yesterday, 5 to 3.
       46:30:07 P    Great! How'd the Astros do?
       46:30:09 CC   Well, I'm sorry to say they were on the wrong end

	Page 182

                         of a 9 to 6 score.
            46:30:13 P   Yes, I was batting zero yesterday, 500 today, maybe
                         a thousand tomorrow.
            46:30:19 CC  That's a boy! How about a thousand by noon?
            46:30:21 P   Yes, that's all right.
            46:31:35 CC  Gemini IX, Houston.
            46:31:37 P   Roger, Houston.
            46:31:39 CC  Roger. You have your GO for 46-1.
            46:31:43 P   Thank you.
            46:31:55 P   How's the weather down there today?
            46:31:57 CC  Well, it was a little foggy when I came in this
                         morning. I think it's probably going to be nice.
                         It's real good now, the latecomers say.
            46:34:44 CC  Gemini IX, Houston.
            46:34:46 C   Houston, IX.
            46:34:47 CC  The little test we ran a little while ago with
                         that water, Tom, and dumping that stuff overboard,
                         we're not quite sure what's happening, so would you
                         give us a gun count when you complete drinking water
                         any time in the next two revolutions?
            46:35:05 C   Okay. Roger....we'll give you one later on.
            46:35:09 CC  Roger.
            46:35:51 CC  IX, Houston. On that water - we only need that
                         when you're through drinking, just before the EVA.
                         That's all we're really interested in, and we do
                         want you to tank up on that stuff.
            46:36:02 C   Roger. We've been going pretty good on it.
            46:36:05 CC  That's a boy!
            46:36:35 C   Right now we're putting on the Y connectors and
	Page 183

                    taping the connections.
       46:36:43 CC  Houston. Roger.
       46:42:36 CC  Gemini IX, Houston. We have approximately 1 minute
                    to LOS and from now on we'll be passive. We'll
                    give you a call at AOS and 1 minute from LOS.
       46:42:48 C   Roger. We'll keep you informed. We're getting Y
                    connectors on and working through there.
       46:42:54 CC  Roger.
       46:42:55 C   Sequence 24.
       46:42:56 CC  Roger, Tom. Thank you.

       46:47:20 CC  Gemini IX, Canary CAP COM. We have you GO on the
                    ground. You need not acknowledge this transmission.
                    We are standing by.
       46:49:34 C   Canary, you can inform Houston we've got the big
                    snake out of the black box.
       46:49:38 CC  Roger, IX.

                         KANO

       46:55:48 CC  Gemini IX, Houston. Standing by.
       46:55:52 P   Roger, Houston. We're still at it.
       46:55:56 CC  Okay.
       46:59:00 CC  Gemini IX, Houston. You can go back to Fuel Cell
                    O<sub>2</sub> Heater to AUTO, at your convenience. Over.
       46:59:49 C   Got it, Dick.
       47:01:45 CC  1 minute LOS, Kano.

             47:08:15 CC   Gemini IX, Houston. Standing by.
             47:08:18 C    ...
             47:10:39 CC   IX, Houston. Go.
             47:10:41 C    I was having a little trouble with the Plat mode
                           here. I'll let you know about it.
             47:10:48 CC   You're having a little trouble with what, Tom?
             47:10:51 C    Roger. It was Plat mode. It was in PLAT until we
                           took off in a big roll on me. I'll keep you informed.
                           I've got it back, coming back to 0, 0, 0
                           degrees.
             47:11:00 CC   Roger. Understand.
             47:13:27 C    Houston, Gemini IX.
             47:13:29 CC   Gemini IX, Houston. Go.
             47:13:31 C    I may need No. 3 Thruster. I'm not sure. Stand
                           by.
             47:13:35 CC   Roger. Understand No. 3.
             47:13:46 C    Either yaw right or roll left ...
             47:13:51 CC   Roger.
             47:14:19 C    Okay. You still ...
             47:14:27 CC   This is Houston. Roger, Tom - we have 1 minute
                           LOS, Tananarive.
             47:14:33 CC   Tom, what was that last ... No. 3 Thruster is out?
             47:14:37 C    Roger. No. 3 Thruster is out.

	Page 185

        47:14:45 C  ... secondary retrofire power is ... Thruster.
                    No. 3 Thruster is out.
        47:14:57 CC Roger, Tom. Understand. Suggest roll logic to
                    Pitch.
        47:15:02 C  ...

                          CARNARVON

        47:22:45 P  Hello, Carnarvon. Gemini IX.
        47:22:47 CC Go ahead, IX.
        47:22:48 P  Roger. Pass this on to Houston. I've got a real
                    weird situation here with the control system.
        47:22:53 CC Go ahead.
        47:22:54 P  ... Part of your PRIMARY or SECONDARY ACME BIAS.
                    When I'm in PLAT, I'm 0, 0, 0 degrees now, and to
                    Aline the Platform, I steer to the yaw needles,
                    but I have to steer away to be away from the roll
                    and pitch needles. To get the Platform to 0, 0, 0
                    is like being in the 180 N<sub>SR</sub> brake. Know which way
                    the needles go?
        47:23:17 CC Roger.
        47:23:19 P  My yaw needle brings the Platform right in, or I
                    have to move the pitch needles up. I have to pitch
                    down to bring it in, or when the roll needle is to
                    the right I have to roll left. Looks like the logic
                    is reversed on the roll and pitch.
        47:23:32 CC Okay. Stand by.
        47:24:26 CC Are you in ACME SECONDARY logic?
        47:24:28 P  I'm in PRIMARY ACME BIAS power, PRIMARY ACME BIAS
                    power. SECONDARY ACME BIAS power gives the same
                    results.
        47:24:37 CC Roger.
	Page 186

             47:24:39 P   Now, I'll go to SECONDARY ACME logic.
             47:24:58 P   Okay. SECONDARY logic, pitch gives the same as
                          PRIMARY. The pitch needle is fly away ... when
                          you're 0, 0, 0 degrees.
             47:25:22 P   The roll is the same. Whether in PRIMARY or SECONDARY
                          ACME logic makes no difference. The yaw
                          and pitch and probably the roll and pitch needles
                          are fly away ... at 0, 0, 0 degrees.
             47:25:34 CC  Roger.
             47:25:39 P   It gave me PLAT and suddenly spun me up to about,
                          I'd say, 20 to 30 degrees per second until I caught
                          it DIRECT.
             47:25:47 CC  Roger.
             47:25:48 P   I'm now in PULSE at 0, 0, 0 degrees ... between
                          PLAT and ATT ... and status is GO on the EVA list.
             47:25:57 CC  Roger. Understand.
             47:26:44 CC  Run a little test and give us a shout here.
             47:26:47 P   Okay. I'll call you through the RATE COMMAND,
                          DIRECT. Our REENTRY RATE COMMAND may all appear
                          to be okay as far as the control motion ...
             47:26:54 CC  Good show.
             47:26:57 P   When shall I come in and knock it off in EVA preparation
                          here?
             47:27:03 P   We'll check No. 3 Thruster here in just a minute.
             47:28:13 C   Okay. Houston, Gemini IX. I'm in Plat mode now,
                          0, 0, 0 and it looks good.
             47:28:18 CC  Okay. Tom, we'll see you around next time.
             47:28:20 C   Roger. Good show. We thought about everything
                          but the brake. We were on the recorder through
                          all types of control motions. Okay. We're going
                          on with the sequence.

       47:43:21 C   Roger, Houston. It looks like we're all squared
                    away. We're in LOS.
       47:43:28 CC  Roger.
       47:43:35 C   Sorry about that breaker.

                    check?
       48:18:45 CC  IX. Houston's about 1 minute from LOS at Antigua.
       48:18:51 C   Roger, Houston.
       48:19:08 C   Houston, Gemini IX.
       48:19:09 CC  Go ahead.
       48:19:11 C   Roger. Sounds like ... the Relief valve on the
                    ELSS is popping.

              48:19:18   CC   Say again, please.
              48:19:19   C    Roger. Sounds like the ELSS Relief valve is continuously
                              popping.
              48:19:27   CC   Roger. Understand.

            48:58:49 C   Carnarvon. Ready to go.
            48:58:51 CC  Roger. Would you close the Tape Recorder circuit
                         breaker?
            48:58:57 C   Close?
            48:58:59 CC  Roger.
            48:59:18 C   Carnarvon, this is IX. Everything is GO here.
            48:59:21 CC  Roger. Give us a minute or two here.
            48:59:50 CC  Gemini IX, Carnarvon CAP COM. You're GO for depressurizing
                         the cabin.
            48:59:54 C   Roger. We'll depressurize at this time.
            48:59:58 CC  Roger. Have a good trip.
            48:59:59 C   Roger. See you next go-around.
            49:00:01 CC  Roger.
            49:02:46 CC  Gemini IX. Have you closed the EV visor yet?
            49:02:48 C   Gemini IX. Negative.

            49:03:21 CC  Okay. I'm reading 791 on ECS O<sub>2</sub> pressure. You

	Page 191

                    want to put your Heater ON and crank it up?
       49:18:48 P   Okay. I'm at .2 and I'm satisfied.
       49:18:52 C   Roger. I'm at 4.0.
       49:18:56 C   ...
       49:19:02 C   ... cabin is 1/2 psi, 1-1/2 psi.
       49:19:17 P   Okay. And I read 5.
       49:19:24 C   Still reads 3-1/2. 1 psi, cabin pressure returning
                    to 1/2 psi.
       49:19:28 C   Suit pressure is holding 3.7.
       49:19:33 P   And I'm holding about 4.2.
       49:19:37 C   Cabin stands at 1/2 psi and my suit is holding good.
       49:19:42 C   Okay. We're at 1/2 psi, Gene.
       49:19:44 C   We're just depressurizing the cabin. All systems
                    are holding good.
       49:19:45 P   Yes. And I'm at 4.2. Okay?
       49:19:46 C   Roger. ...
       49:19:48 C   You all come back ...

                          CANTON ISLAND

       49:19:50 CC   Gemini IX, Houston. Standing by.
       49:19:54 C    I have just depressurized the cabin and all systems
                     are holding pressure good, 1/4 of a psi.
       49:20:01 CC   Can't read it.
       49:20:03 C    Cabin's in all the way. We are going to close our
                     right-hand hatch while we sleep, and the cabin's
                     in now (pressure is holding).

	Page 192

      49:20:06 CC  Understand. Very good.
      49:20:08 P   Okay. You're down now, you want to - -
      49:20:13 C   I'll hang on ...
      49:20:16 C   It's locked.
      49:20:18 C   We've got 7 minutes to go to sunrise, so leave the 
                   sun visor down.
      49:20:24 P   Okay. I can't because it's wedged but I'll get it 
                   down as soon as I open the hatch.
      49:20:27 C   Sunrise: unlock the hatch, push the Spacecraft
                   hatch so it's unlocked.  We're at 1/4 psi pressure
                   reading ... We've got about 6 minutes to go to
                   sunup.
      49:20:41 C   You want to go ahead and get some of that out of
                   the way?
      49:20:43 P   Get what out of the way?
      49:20:45 C   Get the hatch opening out of the way.  Do you want
                   to stay there awhile?  Can you see?
      49:20:53 P   The only way I can see - as soon as I see the sun's
                   rays coming over, Tom - well although we're using
                   water ...
      49:21:13 C   ... see bottom line.
      49:21:18 P   Vent valve is open all the way.  Is that right?
      49:21:22 C   Roger.
      49:21:23 P   Okay. And I read 4.0.  You going to put it in VOX?
      49:21:32 C   Pushing thing to VOX.
      49:21:34 C   Houston, Gemini IX. We now get into VOX.
      49:21:35 CC  Okay, Tom. I am reading you loud and clear right
                   now.
      49:21:36 C   How you read me, Gene?

	Page 193

        49:21:37 P   Okay. I'm reading you loud and clear, Tom, and
                     I'm reading about 4.1 right now.
        49:21:43 C   Roger. We've got 5 minutes to go to midnight.
        49:21:46 P   All right.
        49:21:47 C   Before we've got to ...
        49:21:50 C   If we see anything that looks bad we'll go ahead
                     and stop it.
        49:21:53 CC  Okay.
        49:21:54 P   Okay. Everything looks good. Why don't we go
                     ahead and pop it?
        49:21:56 C   Okay. Go ahead. I'm holding this down.
        49:22:01 P   Okay. We're opening the hatch now.
        49:22:02 C   Roger. Stroke Number 1 and I'm going to hold it
                     for you.
        49:22:06 C   I don't see the dogs - -
        49:22:08 P   ... now.
        49:22:17 C   - - The dogs are starting to rotate.
        49:22:23 C   Very slowly.
        49:22:27 P   Yes the ... in the way here.
        49:22:30 C   Scoot it over.
        49:22:31 P   Yes.
        49:22:32 C   There you go.
        49:22:33 P   Is it moving?
        49:22:34 C   I can't see it from here.
        49:22:35 P   There they go.
        49:22:39 C   Stand by for the pop. Real easy ... psi, Gene.

	Page 194

           49:22:47 P    Okay. They should be open right now, Tom.
           49:22:49 C    Okay.
           49:22:51 P    Hatches coming open.
           49:22:52 C    Hatches coming open.
           49:22:54 P    Hatches open.
           49:22:55 C    All right. We have good ship-to-suit pressure,
                         Gene.
           49:22:59 P    Suit pressure looks like about 4, Tom.
           49:23:01 C    I'm holding a good 3-1/2, Gene.
           49:23:03 P    Okay. It's still a little dark out, isn't it?
           49:23:04 C    Yes, it's kind of dark out there. All right, I'm
                         going to do something there, then start the check
                         list.
           49:23:13 P    Okay.
           49:23:15 C    Gain and Drive selectors to LOCK position.
           49:23:18 P    The lock and the handle are stowed.
           49:23:19 C    Roger. We're on the first page ...
           49:23:25 P    Okay. Let me shove the hatch further up, Tom.
           49:23:26 C    Okay. Now to throw the hatch a quarter ...
           49:23:30 P    Well - -
           49:23:34 C    Wait a minute. It feels kind of stiff here,
                         doesn't it?
           49:23:36 P    - - Yes. Yes, a little bit.
           49:23:37 C    It sure does.
           49:23:39 P    It's pretty dark out here.
           49:23:40 C    I can't even see the light in front of you, Gene.

	Page 195

         49:23:42  P    All right.
         49:23:44  C    Now it looks like it's getting daylight.
         49:23:51  P    Man, the hatch is stiff!
         49:23:52  C    Is it stiff?
         49:23:56  C    As soon as the MAC thermal people make their latest
                        calculations, we'll have a solution. How are you
                        doing?
         49:24:03  P    Yes. Standing in the seat now.
         49:24:06  C    Okay. I've got the garbage bag for you if you're
                        ready to heave it out.
         49:24:11  P    Yes.
         49:24:12  P    You better give it to me here, Tom.
         49:24:13  C    Okay.
         49:24:18  P    What? My heel caught on something?
         49:24:19  C    It's caught on the seat.
         49:24:20  P    That's all right. I'm all right now.
         49:24:23  C    Okay. Here comes the garbage bag.
         49:24:25  C    3 feet-per-second Retrograde. Okay?
         49:24:27  P    Oh, man! I can't --
         49:24:32  C    ...
         49:24:35  P    - - Hallelujah:
         49:24:36  C    Okay. We've gotten rid of the garbage ...
         49:24:39  P    Boy, is it beautiful out there, Tom!
         49:24:40  C    Yes, it sure looks pretty.
         49:24:42  P    I'll grab my Hasselblad and take a picture of that.

	Page 196

49:24:43 C  Okay.
49:24:44 P  But I can't turn around fast enough.
49:24:46 C  Okay. Don't try. Let's go ahead with the next
            step.
49:24:49 P  Okay. Afraid to see how these hatches work for
            us.
49:24:51 C  Okay. How do they feel to you, Gene?
49:24:52 P  I have to see how the handrails are.
49:24:56 P  Well, it's hard to grab hold, but they'll be all
            right, I guess.
49:25:01 C  You're kind of rocking the boat. The Plat mode is
            taking care of the situation, so we're okay.
49:25:06 P  Well, I might try installing - the handrail in the
            back is out and it's a little dark, but I may be
            able to get this one.
49:25:15 C  Yes.
49:25:18 P  I got that one, she's out.
49:25:23 C  Got him?
49:25:24 C  Don't worry about it.
49:25:25 C  Put the visor down when you're ready.
49:25:26 P  Yes. Suit pressure - -
49:25:27 C  How's your suit pressure, Gene?
49:25:28 P  - - I can't see it, it's too dark out.
49:25:29 C  Don't worry about it, Gene. Mine's holding 3-1/2.
49:25:35 C  That's great. Just pull your EV visor down with
            the pressure getting right out there.
49:25:37 P  Okay. My visor is down now, Tom.
	Page 197

        49:25:39 C   Okay. I'm going to push up on Spacecraft ...
                     there, we've got that.
        49:25:43 C   Okay. Position the Gain and Drive selectors to
                     LOCK. Roger.
        49:25:49 P   I checked the Gain selector.
        49:25:51 C   Both Gain selectors to lock, Gene.
        49:25:54 P   Okay. I'll check again but I already put them
                     there, Tom.
        49:25:56 C   Okay. Final check on all systems, all Spacecraft
                     systems.
        49:26:03 P   Stand by. Wait a minute, let me check these.
                     They're locked and they're GO.
        49:26:08 C   Real good. Can you stand on your feet?
        49:26:11 P   Yes, and I want to float out.
        49:26:14 C   We've got the left-hand aft foot well pouch jettisoned.
                     Next thing is our little experiment
                     called S-12.
        49:26:20 P   It's a little bit dark yet, Tom. Let me see.
        49:26:23 C   Well, just stand out there and look at the sunrise,
                     Gene. It looks pretty from here.
        49:26:30 P   It looks like I'm holding about 3.9 right now.
        49:26:32 C   Okay. I'm holding 3.5 in my suit and - -
        49:26:35 P   Yes, and I'm ... slow and very comfortable.
        49:26:37 C   - - Real good show!
        49:26:39 C   I'm going to pump up the ECS O<sub>2</sub> to make sure you've
                     got a good go at 700.
        49:26:47 P   Okay. I'm turning around. Will try to get S-12
                     now, Tom.
        49:26:49 C   Okay. We'll retrieve S-12.

	Page 198

          49:26:52 C    That sun is bright!
          49:26:59 P    I guess it is.
          49:27:06 P    Pull my leg down, Tom.
          49:27:07 C    Which leg?
          49:27:08 P    That one. Yes. Okay.
          49:27:10 P    If I get on the instrument panel, I keep from
                        coming out.
          49:27:11 C    Okay.
          49:27:13 P    Okay. Suit pressure seems to be holding at 4.
          49:27:15 C    Okay.
          49:27:18 P    Everything else is pretty nominal right now.
          49:27:20 C    My suit pressure is 3.6.
          49:27:23 C    I feel real good.
          49:27:32 C    It feels good to have the computer running again.
                        1 minute after sunrise.
          49:27:39 P    Okay. The S-12 lanyard's gone.
          49:27:44 C    Roger.
          49:27:46 P    Here comes S-12, Tom.
          49:27:47 C    Okay. I'm waiting for it.
          49:27:49 P    Okay.
          49:27:50 C    Let me get it.
          49:27:51 P    Oh.
          49:27:52 C    Hang on to that ...
          49:27:54 P    I've still got it.
          49:27:55 C    Right. I've got S-12.

	Page 199

        49:27:56 P   Okay. I'm letting go.
        49:27:59 C   Roger.
        49:28:01 C   Man, I've got S-12 kind of secured down in my
                     foot well.
        49:28:06 P   Okay.
        49:28:07 C   Among other things.
        49:28:08 P   Yes, join the club.
        49:28:09 C   Yes, how about that!
        49:28:11 C   Okay. We've got them.
        49:28:13 C   Check O<sub>2</sub> pressure. You've got to build it up
                     when you can.
        49:28:15 C   Deploy the handrails?
        49:28:17 C   Got those?
        49:28:18 P   Handrail is deployed.
        49:28:20 C   Position cutters.
        49:28:22 P   Okay. Come on there, you cutters.
        49:28:23 C   Got them?
        49:28:27 C   ...
        49:28:31 P   Seven.
        49:28:32 P   Okay. I'm trying to get them now, Tom.
        49:28:33 C   All right.
        49:28:46 P   That's a long way back to that handrail.
        49:28:47 C   Is it?
        49:28:48 P   Yes.
        49:29:06 C   Want to hold your foot here, Gene?

	Page 200

            49:29:08  P    Yes. You'd better hold me so I don't leave you.
            49:29:11  C    I've got you now.
            49:29:15  C    Hanging on, Gene.
            49:29:18  P    Okay.
            49:29:25  C    ...
            49:29:27  P    No. It's pretty much of a bear to get at these
                           things because the handrail is so far back.
            49:29:29  C    Roger.
            49:29:30  P    But I think I can reach it.
            49:29:35  C    What do you see back there? Any hoses off the
                           back end?
            49:29:37  P    What?
           49:29:49   P    I think the cutters will stay.
           49:29:51   C    Okay.
           49:29:54   C    Okay. We'll install the 16mm EV camera now.
           49:29:55   P    Pull me back down.
           49:29:56   C    I'll pull you down. Here you come in. Coming
                           down.
           49:29:59   P    Okay. Pull me down some more.
           40:30:01   C    Coming down. Keep your legs together.
           49:30:03   P    Okay.
           49:30:04   C    Come back here!
           49:30:05   P    Okay.
           49:30:08   C    Install the 16mm camera with 5mm lens.
           49:30:13   P    Okay. Tom, put me back a little more.
	Page 201

            49:30:15       C      Okay.
            49:30:17       P      I don't see anything waving off the adapter from
                                  here.
            49:30:20       C      Good show. I've got you down in the seat now, Gene.
            49:30:30       P      Got to move my Hasselblad around a little bit.
            49:30:31       C      Okay.
            49:30:35       P      Okay.  Let me tighten these devils.
            49:30:37       C      Got it?
            49:30:39       P      Okay.
            49:30:40       C      I'm holding you down here.
             49:30:42      P      Got the camera. Now let me check the settings
                                  again, Tom.
            49:30:44       C      Okay.
            49:30:45       P      Six frames per second, 1/2OOth of a second.
            49:30:49       C      That's right.
            49:30:51       P      And f:16.  Right?
            49:30:56       P      It's a strange world out here, you know it?
            49:30:57       C      Yes.  The stuff looks like the frame of a Ford
                                  except ...
            49:31:18       P      Come back here, camera!
            49:31:19       C      Got it?
            49:31:20       P      Yes.
            49:31:21       C      How are you doing?
            49:31:22       P      I had it in but it wouldn't snap down.
            49:31:23       C      Okay. Try it again.

	Page 202

           49:31:41  P    Pull me down, Tom.
           49:31:42  C    What?
           49:31:43  P    Pull me down. Whoops! Okay.
           49:31:56  P    I don't understand that. Let me see.
           49:32:01  C    I've got your leg.
           49:32:03  P    Okay. Hold on to me a second.
           49:32:25  P    Well, that was a hard fit but it's in.
           49:32:26  C    It's in?
           49:32:27  C    Good show, Gene.
           49:32:29  P    Okay, Tom, let me turn around before I float out.
           49:32:30  C    Let me help, Gene.
           49:32:31  P    Pull that leg down.
           49:32:32  C9   I've got this leg coming down.
           49:32:34  C    There we go.
           49:32:37  C    How's the EV Hasselblad on the ELSS?
           49:32:39  P    I'm all right.
           49:32:41  P    Medium flow and I've still got 3.9.
           49:32:44  C    Okay.
           49:32:46  P    How does the shrouding look to you now on this - -
           49:32:49  C    It looks good.
           49:32:50  P    - - this camera.
           49:32:51  C    It looks pretty good. I'm ready to let you out.
                          The next thing is to attach the Hasselblad to the

	Page 203

                     ELSS chest pack.
        49:32:56 P   Okay.
        49:32:57 C   Put the lanyard and Velcro on.
        49:33:06 P   Hey, and while I'm standing here, Tom, let me at
                     least get a picture.
        49:33:10 C   All right.
        49:33:13 P   We'll find out how easy it is to be able to take
                     pictures with this thing.
        49:33:15 C   You're the highest photographer in the world, right?
        49:33:20 P   (Laughter) Not the highest paid, the highest.
        49:33:22 C   Not the highest paid, but the highest photographer.
                     I guess that's something ...
        49:33:27 P   Man, is that beautiful!
        49:33:29 C   Yes, it looks good, doesn't it?
        49:33:30 P   Oh, boy, Tom!
        49:33:31 C   Okay. We're running pretty good on our Flight
                     Plan, now,
        49:33:39 C   Okay. The next big item is to take the umbilical
                     out of the bag and feed it out. Then move back
                     to the docking bar, Gene.
        49:33:46 P   Okay.
	Page 204

                            CALIFORNIA

         49:33:48 CC  Look, fellows, about - you broke the docking bar?
         49:33:52 P   Neil, get back to work on the thrusters.
         49:33:53 C   Let me know when you start back toward the aft
                      thrusters and I'll shut off the control power.
         49:33:56 P   Okay. Let me take a breather, Tom.
         49:33:57 C   Okay. Take it easy and relax.
         49:34:01 P   Boy, everything wants to ride up. The ELSS wants
                      to ride up in my face. Everything I let go of
                      goes up.
         49:34:11 P   Let me get these Velcro pads on.
         49:34:12 C   Okay.
         49:34:13 CC  Houston standing by.
         49:34:14 P   Affirmed.
         49:34:15 CC  Okay.
         49:34:37 C   Those look real sneaky.
         49:34:39 P   Say Dick, if you're listening and I know you are,
                      boy, you've got a beauty coming.
         49:34:49 C   Houston, Gemini IX. How do you read me?
         49:34:54 CC  We read you loud and clear, Tom.
         49:34:56 C   Don't you read me okay on VOX, Neil?
         49:34:59 CC  Roger. You're clipping a little bit, Tom, but
                      we're getting most of it.
         49:35:00 C   Okay. We've got the EVA camera put up and we're
                      taking a break here to relax.
         49:35:04 C   Gene's taking a couple of pictures, standing on the
                      seat. We'll be going on with the Flight Plan shortly.

	Page 205

         49:35:06  CC   Okay.
         49:35:11  CC   Very good.
         49:35:13  P    Okay. I'm relaxed for a second, Tom.
         49:35:15  C    While I'm having the break, I think I'll relax and
                        have a cup of coffee.
         49:35:19  CC   Okay.
         49:35:21  P    On the next pass, we'll talk to you and George
                        (George Low, NASA official). I'm sure you don't
                        want to talk now.
         49:35:27  P    What part of California are we going to come up on,
                        do they know?
         49:35:30  C    Neil, it looks like we're going to be coming up on
                        Baja California. That's about right on the track ...
         49:35:41  CC   Yes. That's right, Tom.
         49:35:46  C    Okay. Gene feels real good in ELSS now.
         49:35:49  C    The temperatures are good; our suit pressures are
                        holding real good.
         49:35:54  CC   Houston. Roger.
         49:35:56  C    Okay.
         49:36:11  P    About 2 more minutes, Tom.
         49:36:16  C    Okay. You want to pass me a belt around? Is that
                        what our next step is?
         49:36:18  P    Okay. I'm going to see if I can get out of here,
                        Tom and -
         49:36:20  P    I passed it up.
         49:36:22  C    Okay. I'll help guide your feet out, Gene, and
                        I'll start taking some pretty pictures. Don't
                        back off the Scanner Heater circuit breaker,
                        whatever you do.
	Page 206

           49:36:36 C   Ease on out there, Gene. Here we go.
           49:36:38 P   Whew! We're coming right over LA, I think.
           49:36:40 C   ...
           49:36:42 P   I can see Edwards - I can see the Islands.
           49:36:43 P   I want to go up. I've got to give myself a shove
                        forward.
           49:36:46 P   I saw Edwards. That's a pretty lakeside.
           49:36:51 C   See the F-4 near the runway?
           49:36:52 P   Yes.
           49:36:54 C   That was a little thing the Air Force built.
           49:37:05 P   Okay. Can you keep a bearing in there or what?
           49:37:09 P   I'm keeping the bearing as closely as I can.
           49:37:11 p   Okay.
           49:37:14 P   Can you get it?
           49:37:26 P   We're south of LA. There's Baja California.
           49:37:31 C   Yes. Look out for ... Lake ...
           49:37:36 C   Okay. Can you pull that in anymore?
           49:37:40 P   Okay.
           49:37:43 P   That's about it, Pete, for today.
           49:37:44 CC  ...
           49:37:45 C   I can't, you've got some ...
           49:37:48 P   Taking a picture of Baja right here.
           49:37:49 C   Okay.
           49:38:09 C   Say, is that terrific! Gene's taking a picture of
                        Baja California, looking ...

	Page 207

         49:38:14 CC   Houston. Roger.
         49:38:21 P    See how everything goes up, Tom?
         49:38:23 C    Yes. Even out here.
         49:38:27 P    Okay.
         49:38:29 C    Right on the nose. Roger.
         49:38:33 P    Okay. Wait a minute.
         49:38:35 C    Take it a little bit slower ...
         49:38:44 C    Pressure holding good?
         49:38:46 P    Yes, mine's holding good.
         49:38:49 C    No possible leak?
         49:38:52 P    Okay. You better give the camera now.
         49:38:55 C    Wait a minute here; I'll switch it.
         49:39:07 P    That space is rolling along out here.
         49:39:09 C    Yes.
         49:39:11 C    12 minutes, 30 seconds...
         49:39:19 P    Okay. I'm going to see if I can get out of
                       here, Tom.
         49:39:21 C    Okay. I'll - almost good.
         49:39:36 C    Good enough for a day.
         49:39:42 P    If I'm going to go out, I got to get myself pushed
                       forward.

                             TEXAS

         49:39:55 P    I can't get there unless I come down a little bit.
         49:39:56 C    You want to come back in and let me help you with
                       this?
	Page 208

          49:39:57 P    Yes.
          49:39:59 C    Give me your foot.
          49:40:06 P    Okay. Let it go now.
          49:40:08 C    You've really changed the moment of inertia of
                        the Spacecraft.
          49:40:10 P    Okay. Let it go, Tom.
          49:40:13 C    Don't let it suck you away.
          49:40:20 C    It looks pretty out there, Gene. It surely wants
                        to float up though.
          49:40:25 P    Yes.
          49:40:30 C    Now we've got the docking bar mirror. Looks Like
                        you're upside down and have all kinds of snake
                        around you.
          49:40:39 P    Hello, there! If I can get over here, I'll take
                        a picture, Tom.
          49:40:44 C    Okay. I don't know how long you can hold out
                        there; you want to float up right away.
          49:40:46 P    Yes. Boy, it's really hard to get any torquing
                        with one hand!
          49:40:49 C    Yes, I can see that.
          49:40:51 C    If you let go, you're going to fly right off that
                        thing.
          49:40:54 C    Hold it ... with the Spacecraft Plat mode ...
          49:41:01 P    If I can ever get hold of it with my other hand.
          49:41:06 C    Yes. Okay. Let me get some pictures of the ...
                        tube.
          49:41:10 C    Smile.
          49:41:25 P    Boy, am I smiling!
          49:41:27 C    Okay. I've got a picture, Gene.

	Page 209

        49:41:30  P    I'd like you to smile.
        49:41:31  C    Okay, I'll smile. I've got a picture. I'll get
                       back in and we'll press right on with the Flight
                       Plans. I've got another of you.
        49:41:44  C    Okay. Mark 15 minutes and 10 seconds after going
                       out there.
        49:41:49  P    Okay, Tom.
        49:41:51  C    All right.
        49:41:54  P    I'm going to pitch off here to the left.
         49:41:58 C    Okay. Come on over to the left.
         49:42:03 P    To my left over here?
         49:42:04 C    To your left.
         49:42:06 P    Okay. I'll come to your left. It doesn't make
                       any difference.
         49:42:07 C    Come on down there so I can help you down ...
         49:42:10 C    Let me know if you get down near those thrusters.
         49:42:13 P    I don't know where I'm going right now, so hold on.
         49:42:15 P    Yes. I'm getting there, Tom.
         49:42:17 C    Well, let me know when you get on the adapter.
                       Maybe you ought to bang on it now.
         49:42:22 C    Let me know to shut it off. Shut them off?
         49:42:25 P    Yes. I'm all right.
         49:42:26 C    Okay.
         49:42:27 P    Okay. I've got the snake all over me.
         49:42:30 C    You've got what?
         49:42:31 P    Snake all over me.
         49:42:36 P    Have you got this other camera on?

	Page 210

           49:42:37 C   I've got the EVA camera on. You're looking good
                        all right.
           49:42:42 P   Okay. If I can push off, I'm going to try to get
                        out here where I can evaluate this umbilical.
           49:42:46 C   Okay. Go ahead. (Laughter)
           49:42:53 P   I can't get my feet in the right place to push off.
           49:43:06 P   There goes your dump.
           49:43:07 C   That's all right.
           49:43:08 P   Okay, Tom. Here I go.
           49:43:10 C   Okay. There you go, Gene. Real good.
           49:43:15 P   I got caught.
           49:43:22 C   Guaymas, IX here. Looks like the umbilical by
                        itself is a pretty hard row to hoe.
           49:43:30 C   What do you think, Gene?
           49:43:31 P   Yes, it's not the best.
           49:43:34 C   Okay, Houston. He's right by my left window now
                        slowly rotating. I'll take a picture.
           49:43:42 P   I can't get over here, Tom, to get where I want to
                        get.
           49:43:46 P   Okay. See if I can get a start and push away.
           49:43:49 C   All right. I'll be all right.
           49:43:50 C   Okay. Go ahead - taking a picture of you.
           49:43:54 C   Okay. 17 minutes and 20 seconds after sunrise.
           49:44:06 P   Okay, Tom. I'm going straight for you.
           49:44:08 C   Okay, I can see you in the darkness while we're
                        here and appears ... looking real good. Let me
                        know when you get near those thrusters.
	Page 211

        49:44:12 P    Yes. I can see you in the cockpit. I'm overhead;
                      you're real good.
        49:44:22  P   Okay. I've just been back towards them, Tom.
        49:44:25  C   Come back in soon as I turn them off.
        49:44:30  P   You better turn them off, I can't - ...
        49:44:32  C   I'm going to take a ... picture through the mirror.
        49:44:41  C   Let me know when you ... I've got to get the thing
                      Alined up ...
        49:44:56  P   Okay. I'm out in front now.
        49:44:58  C   I'm going to go to PULSE now.
        49:45:06  P   Okay. I'm going further out in front, Tom.
        49:45:08  C   Okay. It really disturbed the heck out of the
                      platform here.
        49:45:15  P   Boy, what a beautiful Spacecraft, Golly!
        49:45:18  C   Okay. I want to get back in Plat mode here.
        49:45:22  P   I'm trying to get out in front here where I can
                      get a good evaluation of pod and this umbilical.
        49:45:30  C   Yes, I've got it coming back into 0, 0, 0 degrees.
        49:45:32  P   I'm going to try to get over on your side and
                      evaluate those Velcro pads, Tom.
        49:45:34  C   Okay.
        49:45:46  P   Okay. I'm drifting back towards the adapter, Tom.
        49:45:49  C   You are? Okay. I'm in Pulse mode.
        49:45:51  P   Okay.
        49:45:58  C   Let me know when you're near one of those thrusters.
        49:46:10  C   Like my hand, bring ... torch.

	Page 212

           49:46:12 P    Okay. What happened, I started using one of those
                         Velcro pads and - I lost it. It came right off my
                         hands.
           49:46:20 P    Well, I'm right outside your window.
           49:46:32 C    I'm going to PULSE.
           49:46:34 P    Say again?
           49:46:37 C    Going to PULSE.
           49:46:39 P    Well, I can for a little bit but I want to evaluate
                         these hand pads if I can.
           49:46:49 P    Okay. Now I'm stuck on this thing with a hand pad
                         right now but they won't stay. The Velcro's not
                         strong enough here.
           49:46:54 C    Velcro won't hack it, right?
           49:46:56 P    Well, not there it won't, unless that nose is burned
                         off slightly.
           49:47:01 C    You going back on that adapter again?
           49:47:03 P    Yes. Wait a minute.
           49:47:08 C    I'm going to Plat mode. Where are you?
           49:47:13 P    I'm right on top of your window.
           49:47:14 C    I've got a picture of you.
           49:47:18 C    You'll have to put some torque on the Spacecraft,
                         Gene.
           49:47:20 P    The only control I have is the umbilical and, of
                         course, the shorter it is, the better control I've
                         got.
           49:47:26 C    Yes.
           49:47:27 C    Okay. We've got 20 minutes of sunrise and 30 minutes
                         to sunset.
           49:47:30 P    Okay.
	Page 213

         49:47:34 C    Okay. 35 minutes and we'll change that film pack.
                       Okay?
         49:47:39 P    Okay, Tom.
         49:47:44 C    ... Looks like ...
         49:47:51 P    Watch it, Tom, I'm coming down. I'm trying to go
                       up here now if I can, away from you. Right out in
                       here.
         49:48:03 C    I'm going to go back to Plat mode.
         49:48:06 P    Okay. I'm at the end of the umbilical.
         49:48:08 C    Okay.
         49:48:10 P    Man, is it - -
         49:48:12 C    Yes, you look like a real snake out there.
         49:48:20  C   You're going end over end, Gene.
         49:48:21 P    - - Yes.
         49:48:44 P    I want to see what I can do around the nose here.
         49:48:46  C   Okay.
         49:49:01 P    Oh, boy. All I did was twitch my fingers and I
                       gave myself a torque that would'nt quit.
         49:49:04  C   ...
         49:49:13  C   Okay. Come on over in front of the window and I
                       can get a picture of you. Go on with your evaluation.
         49:49:20  P   Yes.
         49:49:27  P   Boy, the shorter the umbilical, there's obviously
                       much better room you've got.
         49:49:30  C   Yes.
         49:49:31  P   When I get back there, I'll try this other hand
                       pad, but so far it doesn't look like it's stiff
                       enough.
	Page 214

           49:49:42 C    You'd better shorten up on your umbilical there,
                         Gene.
           49:49:44 P    Yes. As soon as I find it, Tom.
           49:49:46 C    Okay.
           49:49:56 P    There goes that other hand pad. I couldn't keep
                         them on.
           49:50:01 C    Okay. Understand. The Velcro hand pads came right
                         off your ...
           49:50:03 P    One - one came right off my hand.
           49:50:10 C    This is really a fine piece of gear. I can see you
                         real well.
           49:50:15 P    Okay, Tom. I'll come back to the hatch here for a
                         second. What time is it?
           49:50:20 C    Okay. Fine. It's about 24 minutes after sunrise.
           49:50:34 P    It takes a lot longer to get anywhere with this
                         umbilical than anyone figured, I'm sure.
           49:50:42 C    Okay. Your foot just kicked my head here. Do you
                         want me to help you in the hatch, Gene?
           49:50:51 P    Well, (laughter), I don't have any torque capability.
           49:50:56 C    Let me have your foot with my hand here and I'll
                         see what I can do for you.
           49:51:01 P    How's that?
           49:51:06 C    Just kick your foot forward just a little bit.
           49:51:10 C    Come on. Don't kick that dear Heater circuit
                         breaker, whatever you do.
           49:51:15 P    Okay. I've got one foot.
           49:51:18 C    Okay. Now you're coming in.
           49:51:20 P    Okay.
	Page 215

        49:51:26 C   Okay, Gene, come on down. Come on down. How are
                     you doing there?
        49:51:34 P   I must be under something. Okay.
        49:51:39 C   Pretty good?
        49:51:41 P   It looks like you had a nice lunch. ...
        49:51:46 C   How steady are you now, Gene?
        49:51:49 P   Okay, Tom. I'm going to slow down and take a rest.
        49:51:54 C   Okay.
        49:51:58 C   Houston, Gemini IX. How do you read?
        49:52:01 CC  We still read you, Tom.
        49:52:02 C   Okay. Gene is finished with the umbilical evaluation
                     and it looks pretty rubbery out on the adapter.
                     When I get back there in the cockpit I can see him
                     real well with his docking bar mirror. It's a
                     real useful piece of gear. Our suit pressures are
                     holding good and we're both real comfortable in the
                     suits. We're standing by to ...
        49:52:22 CC  Roger. We've got that.
        49:52:38 P   Boy, this thing really snakes, you know it?
        49:52:54 C   About 6 minutes and 20 seconds to go.
        49:53:44 P    ... time resume ...
        49:53:50 P   Tom, can you read me?
        49:53:51 C   ...
        49:54:01 P   ...
        49:54:09 P   It's still running.
        49:54:10 C   ...
        49:54:19 P   ...
	Page 216

          49:54:27 C    What's that?
          49:54:28 P    ...
          49:54:58 C    Hello at Grand Turk.
          49:55:01 CC   ...
          49:55:06 C    Little warm in spots.
          49:55:28 CC   Gemini IX, Houston. Let's take a check on that
                        primary tank pressure now.
          49:55:35 CC   Bump it up.
          49:55:46 P    Pretty fantastic out here, Tom.
          49:55:51 C    ...
          49:55:56 P    ...
          49:56:26 CC   Houston to ... LOS.
          49:56:55 P    Okay. Stay with that, Tom.
          49:56:57 C    ... all squared away for you, Gene.
          49:57:00 P    ...
          49:57:28 CC   LOS Antigua.
          49:59:22 C    Yes.
          49:59:28 C    Okay, okay at 32 minutes.
          50:00:32 C    Let's go over the part about the trip back to the
                        adapter. It gave some pretty good torques to the
                        Spacecraft, so get back out of the way of the
                        thrusters as soon as you can when you get back
                        there.
          50:00:42 P    Okay.
          50:00:43 C    I'll have to place it in Pulse mode here.
          50:00:46 P    It may be better because I'll be going back on the
                        rails this time.
	Page 217

       50:00:54  C    Okay.
       50:01:20  P    How are we doing on time?
        50:01:22 C    34 minutes. Do you want to go back to the adapter
                      earlier, or just stay here and relax?
       50:01:29  P    Oh, it's probably going to take a little bit more
                      time to close the hatch than I thought. The seal
                      is still soft.
        50:01:37  C   What?
        50:01:38  P   The seal is still soft.
        50:01:39  C   Yes, it is.
        50:01:48  CC  Gemini IX, Houston standing by over Ascension.
        (Note: Transmissions through 50:05:21 were garbled. Unable to clarify.)
       50:01:51  C   Roger ...
       50:02:03  CC  Okay. We're not reading you very well yet.
       50:02:06  C   ...
       50:02:08  CC  Roger.
       50:02:18  CC  Tom, can you see whether the Tape Recorder Power
                     circuit breaker is ON or OFF on the right console?
       50:02:32  C   It is ON.
       50:02:33  CC  Okay.
       50:02:42  C   ...
       50:02:57  C   ...
                 P   ... close the hatch.
       50:03:01  C   ... I don't think so.
       50:03:31  P   Get out here so I can see ...
       50:03:46  P   ...
	Page 218

             50:03:51  P    ...
             50:03:57  P    ...
             50:04:00  P    ...
             50:04:03  C    ...
             50:04:19  P    Pretty close.
             50:04:22  C    ...
             50:04:27  P    Okay. ... out there.
             50:04:29  C    Okay.
             50:04:34  P    ...
             50:04:38  O    ...
             50:04:40  P    ...
             50:04:45  c    ...
             50:05:03  C    ... hold it back to 20 degrees.
             50:05:12  P    ... all the way, go ahead.
             50:05:14  P    Can you ...?
             50:05:16  C    ...
             50:05:21  P    ...
             50:11:11  P    Let's go real slow, Tom. I have no EV lights back
                            here. You'd better turn them on.
             50:11:13  C    You have the lights on?
             50:11:14  P    No.
             50:11:15  C    Want me to turn them on?
             50:11:16  P    Yes.
             50:11:17  C    Good show. Let me get this thing coming around here.
	Page 219

              50:11:49        C      I'm having some trouble on them, Gene. Just a
                                     minute.
              50:11:53        P      I want the lights and thrusters.
              50:11:54        C      I've got the lights on.
              50:11:56        P      Okay. I've only got one of them on back here. The one light.
              50:11:58        C       One light. Roger.
              50:12:l0        P       Okay.
              50:12:12        C       Pull your umbilical to remove slack. You all
                                      squared sway?
              50:12:15        P       Yes.
              50:12:16        C       Unstow and position mirrors.
              50:12:21        P       Stand by.
              50:12:58        P       Okay, the mirrors are out.
              50:13:00        C       Okay. I bet you have a fantastic view back there,
                                      Gene.
              50:13:03        P       I don't know. I'm looking the wrong way.
              50:13:06        C       That's right. Okay.
              50:13:10        C       Unstow pen lights and actuate lights; attach Velcro
                                      to the hand bars.
              50:13:36        P       Yes. Number 1 is working.
              50:13:37        C       Good show!
              50:13:44        P       ... going to try to get around back here.
              50:13:46        C       Is it?
              50:13:47        P       Yes.
              50:13:56        P       And the other one does not work. How's that?
	Page 220

         50:13:58  C   What's this?
          50:13:59 P   The one on each side.
          50:14:00 C   Okay. One pen light doesn't work, one EVA light
                       doesn't work.
          50:14:l0 C   Okay.
          50:14:12 C   Ready for the next step?
          50:14:15 P   Yes. Let's go slow though.
          50:14:17 C   I'm going back in Plat mode. Stand by for a couple
                       of bumps.
          50:14:25 C   Okay. We're back in Plat mode, Gene.
          50:14:29 P   Okay.
          50:14:30 C   Okay?
          50:14:32 C   The next one is: Connect black tether jumper hook
                       to the AMU tether ring.
          50:14:39 P   Okay. If I can find it.
          50:14:41 C   Right. Understand you are back in the adapter and
                       it is very hot.
          50:15:58 P   Yes, it's very, very hot.
          50:16:08 C   Go back to Houston ... burn.
          50:16:14 C   Hello, Houston. Gemini IX.
          50:16:20 C   Houston, Gemini IX.
          50:16:36 P   Yes. We're really cooking back here.
          50:16:37 C   Okay. Just take your time, Gene.
          50:16:54 C   One thing about it, we allocated ourselves plenty
                       of time and we're starting to use one of these
                       little unknown things like the hatch and all that.
          50:17:05 C   Okay, Gene. Nighttime coming your way shortly.

	Page 221

        50:17:08  P   Okay. I'm going to wait until it gets here.
        50:17:14  C   How do the lights work? As good as we hoped?
        50:17:16  P   It's not dark back here yet.
        50:17:22  P   They're only half as good. Only one is on.
        50:17:25  C   How's that other pen light? You have the pen light
                      that's going to help you there?
        50:17:29  P   Yes. I've got one pen light and one EVA light.
        50:17:30  C   Roger.
        50:17:31  P   The umbilical hung up back there, Tom.
        50:17:32  C   It did hang up. Right?
        50:17:33  P   Yes.
        50:17:34  C   But you got it loose?
        50:17:35  P   Yes.
        50:17:36  C   Good show, Gene.
        50:18:13  P   At about 3.9.
        50:18:15  C   Okay. How's the temperature inside the suit, Gene?
        50:18:16  P   Hot and warm on my back.
        50:18:17  C   Hot and warm on your back. I can imagine the sun
                      beating down on you.
        50:18:38  P   How much time do we have before sunset?
        50:18:40  C   I can set up and see the sunset in my rear-view
                      mirror. I'm up in no time here, Gene.
        50:18:48  P   You are?
        50:19:15  C   Still working on the ... relation to relaxing.
        50:19:17  P   Just relaxing, Tom. I'm ready to start here in a
                      minute. What's the next step?

	Page 222

           50:19:22 C   Okay. Unstow tether bag and connect both orange
                        AMU tether hooks to ring on umbilical tether.
           50:19:32 P   Okay. Stand by.
           50:19:37 C   Hello, Houston. Gemini IX.
           50:19:44 C   Hello, Houston. Gemini IX.
           50:19:49 CC  Gemini IX, Houston. Standing by. We're reading
                        you weak and garbled.
           50:19:55 C   Roger. Gene's in the adapter now. Going through
                        Step 7 here, attach the tether bag and he's considerably
                        warmer on the back. I believe it is from
                        what we anticipated, so we are taking a break here
                        until he cools off.
           50:20:09 CC  We can't make you out, Tom.
           50:20:12 C   Roger. I'll have the Tananarive CAP COM Relayer
                        contact you.
           50:20:34 C   Okay. Going back to medium flow. Place time at
                        54 minutes (EVA time from hatch opening).

                              TANANARIVE

           50:20:41 C   Hello, Houston. Gemini IX.
           50:20:51 CC  Houston. Go ahead.
           50:20:53 C   Roger, Houston. Gemini IX. Our ECS O<sub>2</sub> quantity
                        is now 47 percent.
           50:21:03 C   Would you recommend that we open the crossfeed
                        between the ECS O<sub>2</sub> and the fuel cell O<sub>2</sub>?
           50:21:17 CC  This is Houston. We're not reading you very well
                        at all.
           50:21:27 C   How's it going, Gene?
           50:21:30 P   I'm still trying to get these darn hooks, Tom.
           50:21:32 C   Okay.
	Page 223

         50:21:47 P    Let it go in the high flow until I cool off.
         50:21:49 C    Okay.
         50:21:58 C    Houston, Gemini IX. How do you read?
         50:22:34 C    Hello, Houston. Gemini IX. Do you read through
                       Tananarive?
         50:22:43 C    Tananarive contact, Gemini IX.
         50:22:46 CC   Gemini IX, Tananarive contact. Go ahead.
         50:22:48 C    Roger. Relay to Houston. Our ECS Quantity - our
                       ECS O<sub>2</sub> Quantity is 46 percent. Do they recommend
                       that I open the valve, please?
         50:22:58 CC   ECS Quantity 46 percent. Did they recommend that
                       you open the crossfeed?
         50:23:04 C    That is affirmative.
         50:23:17 P    These darn hooks, Tom.
         50:23:18 C    What's wrong, Gene?
         50:23:19 P    Can't get the tether back on.
         50:23:23 C    Can't get it out?
         50:23:24 P    Can't get it on.
         50:23:31 C    Is it harder than what we did on the simulator.
         50:23:32 P    Boy!
         50:23:34 C    What's wrong, Gene?
         50:23:36 P    If I can make the hooks, I'll be all right.
         50:23:39 C    Are you getting the hooks attached to your
                       umbilical ring?
         50:23:41 P    Yes.
         50:24:01 CC   Gemini IX, Tananarive.
	Page 224

           50:24:04 C    Roger. I heard Houston. The answer is negative.
           50:24:05 CC   Very good.
           50:24:10 C    Okay. You still working on hooking these hooks up?
           50:24:12 P    Yes.
           50:24:14 C    Okay. Just take your time hooking it up.
           50:24:16 C    Here comes the moon up full ahead. A good moon
                         shot - -
           50:24:17 CC   Gemini IX, contact Tananarive ... read at 46
                         percent ... Is that correct?
           50:24:25 C    Tananarive contact. This is Gemini IX. That is
                         affirmative. 46 percent.
           50:24:32 C    Tananarive. Tell them that we have to use considerably
                         higher rate to keep the Pilot cool.
           50:24:39 CC   You have to use considerably higher rate to keep
                         the Pilot cool. Is that correct?
           50:24:44 C    That's affirmative.
           50:25:01 C    What did you say, Gene?
           50:25:03 P    I've got my hooks on the ring.
           50:25:10 C    Okay, Gene. You got both of them hooked now?
           50:25:14 P    Just one of them.
           50:25:25 C    Yes. You should be starting to cool off, now that
                         nighttime is here.
           50:25:28 P    I almost got this other bad one, but I can't get
                         it.
           50:25:32 C    What's wrong? It's hard to hook?
           50:25:37 P    The umbilical is flying all over the place and
                         the ... Tom.
           50:25:51 C    Okay. Just take your time on it, Gene. Take your
                         time.
	Page 225

        50:25:58  C    ... your umbilical to ...
        50:26:10  P    I can't get the tether hooked on this cargo.
         50:26:20 C    Why, are the rings too small?
         50:26:22 P    No. They're just too hard to get at.
         50:26:27 C    Roger. Just take your time. We've got plenty of
                       time.
         50:26:29 P    I've got the 125-foot hook on, Tom. I'm tempted to
                       leave the other one for awhile.
         50:26:31 C    Okay. Just leave it. Go ahead.
         50:26:33 P    I'm going to leave it.
         50:26:34 C    Go ahead.
         50:26:36 C    Okay. The next item: inspect AMU battery cases
                       and verify RCS handles in stowed position.
         50:26:49 P    Check.
         50:26:53 P    Okay. Battery cases are GO.
         50:26:55 C    Okay.
         50:27:01 P    RCS handles stowed.
         50:27:10 P    And that one's stowed.
         50:27:11 C    Okay.
         50:27:14 C    Okay. Install attitude controller arm, and verify
                       all six positions.
         50:27:29 P    Okay. It's going to be a bad one.
         50:27:39 P    Oh, shucks!
         50:27:44 C    It's worse than under - under simulation.
         50:27:46 P    You can't - can't get two hands in there.
         50:27:57 P    Oh, you bad one.
	Page 226

               50:27:59       C      Get it yet?
               50:28:00       P      No.
               50:28:03       P      In 1 g you float up and your stops just won't quite
                                     hack it.
               50:28:08       P      I've got to rest a minute.
               50:28:09       C      Okay. Take your time.
               50:28:13       C      If you can't get enough force there to get the
                                     thing to pull down out of that slot -
               50:28:33       C      Any luck yet, Gene?
               50:28:34       P      No.
               50:28:41       P      Yes.   I've got it.
               50:28:42       C      Got it.   Good show!
               50:28:58       C      We've got to turn all six positions.    You have to
                                     pull the other one.
               50:29:03       P      Okay.   Let's go.
               50:29:04       C      Okay.   Let's unstow the translational controller and
                                     check it at all four positions.
               50:29:19       C      How are you doing, Gene?
               50:29:22       P      Getting there, Tom.
               50:29:23       C      Good.
               50:29:39       C      Still working on the translational controller,
                                     right?
               50:29:41       P      Yes.  Coming up to it now.
               50:29:49       C      I can tell you're heated back there....
               50:29:50       C      Got her?
               50:29:51      P       Yes.
	Page 227

        50:29:52 C    Good show,Gene.
        50:29:53 C    Okay.
        50:29:54 P    Wait a minute. It's not all the way down.
        50:30:03 P    Okay.
        50:30:08 C    Okay ....
        50:30:09 P    Who said this visor wouldn't fog up?
        50:30:10 P    Is it fogging on you?
        50:30:11 P    Yes.
        50:30:12 C    Okay.
        50:30:14 C    Understand visor is fogging. Okay. Next break,
                      attach those temperature sensors if you can see
                      them.
        50:30:24 C    You're going to have the moon back there in just a
                      minute.
        50:30:27 P    Okay. I've got the temperature sensors on. I had
                      them both on, and one fell off.
        50:30:29 C    Okay. Attach - unstow and attach to the controller
                      arm in the following order: Oxygen hose - -
        50:30:40 P    I've got to take a rest, Tom.
        50:30:41 C    - - Take your time, Gene.
        50:30:44 C    We're not in bad shape at all.
        50:30:49 C    You'll have the moon up in just a minute back there
                      and that should be able to help you.
        50:30:56 P    Phew! Okay. Read - what's the first one, oxygen?
        50:31:03 C    Oxygen hose.
        50:31:05 P    I've got plenty of light.
        50:31:06 C    You've got plenty of light.
	Page 228

          50:31:09 P   It's the tendency to float up out of these
                       stirrups that gets to you.
          50:31:10 C   Okay.
          50:31:15 C   Restraint harness.
          50:31:17 P   Wait a minute.
          50:31:22 P   Here's the oxygen hose. You can't bend down here
                       like you can in 1 g.
          50:31:29 C   I'll say. Yes.
          50:31:46 P   I'm working up a good heat load, I'll tell you.
          50:31:48 C   Yes. I can imagine.
          50:31:51 C   I think the worst part is over there, isn't it?
          50:31:56 P   You son-of-a-gun.
          50:31:58 C   What are you working on, the restraint harness?
          50:31:59 P   Yes.
          50:32:22 P   Okay. I've got one side of it. Let me get the
                       other side.
          50:32:32 P   The other visor's - visor's fogging up all over
                       the place.
          50:32:36 C   Go to HIGH RATE if you have to, Gene.
          50:32:38 P   I am HIGH RATE.
          50:33:03 P   Okay. I've got the other side.
          50:33:04 C   Okay....next is electrical umbilical.
          50:33:10 P   I'm really fogging up, Tom.
          50:33:11 C   Take your time.
         50:33:17  P   Real good.

                             CARNARVON
        50:33:22 C    Houston, Gemini IX.
        50:33:27 C    Carnarvon, Gemini IX.
        50:33:32 P    Okay.
        50:33:51 C    Hey, we have Hydrogen Pressure of ...
        50:33:58 C    Prepare to this ... read ...
        50:34:01 CC   Carnarvon is standing by.
        50:34:05 C    Roger. ... is zero.
        50:34:09 C    Full ...
        50:34:14 C    The gage isn't open yet so let's see what happens.
        50:34:18 C    It's ... open ... now.
        50:34:29 C    Zero ...
        50:34:50 C    Affirmative.
        50:35:02 C    ... Gemini has ... of 00 ... the Oxygen valve's
                      been reading O<sub>2</sub> ...
        50:35:19 CC   Give them another call, Bill.
        50:35:37 C    ... up ... no good.
        50:35:48 C    Peroxide is still 455. Temperature is good.
        50:35:50 C    How does the oxygen pressure look?
        50:35:51 P    Still opening the valve.
        50:36:08 CC   Carnarvon is standing by.
        50:36:10 P    Okay. It's open.
        50:36:11 C    Roger.
        50:36:14 C    Okay. You've got the Oxygen valve open?

	Page 230

           50:36:16 C   What do you read on oxygen pressure?
           50:36:18 P   Wait till I get back down there.
           50:36:34 P   The oxygen reads about 7,500 and the nitrogen is
                        up around 3,000. I can't quite read it.
           50:36:40 C   Okay. So it looks like we we're in good shape then,
                        right?
           50:36:42 P   Yes.
           50:36:44 C   Okay. Mode Selector switch to MANUAL and VOX
                        switch to VOX.
           50:36:46 P   There, that way?
           50:36:48 C   Okay. Release the nozzle extensions.
           50:36:56 P   Okay. Nozzle extensions are released.
           50:36:57 P   There's Number 1.
           50:36:58 C   Okay.
           50:36:59 P   Boy, is this fogging - this visor's fogging up!
           50:37:01 C   Is it?
           50:37:03 P   Yes. Here's Number 2.
           50:37:04 C   Roger. Okay.
           50:37:06 C   H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. T/M Selector switch is BACKPACK.
           50:37:12 P   BACKPACK.
           50:37:15 C   Okay. Turn left 180 degrees and back into the AMU.
           50:37:20 P   Tom, we've got the Battery switch to GO.
          50:37:22  C   Okay. Main Power switch ON.
          50:37:24  P   Okay. Main Power switch is ON. The lights are ON
                       and we've got power.
          50:37:32 C   Okay. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> T/M Selector switch to BACKPACK, right?

	Page 231

         50:37:36 P    That's affirm.
         50:37:37 P    Boy, I'm fogged up. My pressure - my pressure
                       reading is fogged up, my visor's fogged up and I'm
                       in high-flow.
         50:37:43 C    Okay. Just turn it - can you see at all, Gene?
         50:37:46 P    Yes. I can see.
         50:37:47 C    Okay.Turn around 180 degrees and back in the AMU
                       and relax.
         50:37:53 C    Carnarvon, Gemini IX.
         50:37:54 CC   Go ahead, IX.
         50:37:56 C    Okay. He's fogging real bad and we have to use
                       high-flow to keep the fogging down to minimum and
                       the attitude controller arms and the maneuver controller
                       arms presented far more difficulty to us
                       in zero g than they did in the simulation. The big
                       problem now is his thrust gage is fogged and his
                       visor is fogged and we're just taking it easy here.
         50:38:20 CC   Roger.
         50:38:22 C    Okay, Gene. How we doing?
         50:38:27 P    I don't know. I'll let you know.
         50:38:34 P    Well, believe it or not, I think I've gotten
                       turned around.
         50:38:44 C    Carnarvon, Gemini IX. If you read, Houston, our
                       ECS O<sub>2</sub> Pressure is 42 percent. 42 percent.
         50:38:54 CC   Say again.
         50:38:56 C    Roger. Houston, our ECS Quantity is 42 percent.
         50:38:58 CC   Understand.
         50:39:05 P    Boy!
         50:39:07 C    How are you doing, Gene?

	Page 232

           50:39:08 P    Really fogged up, Tom.
           50:39:10 C    Okay.
           50:39:15 CC   That quantity is right on the money, Tom.
           50:39:17 C    Okay. He has to use higher rate to keep from
                        fogging quite a bit.
           50:39:29 C    Okay. Let me know when you're ready to position
                        it. Are you in the AMU now, Gene? All squared
                        away?
           50:39:39 P    Let me take another look.
           50:39:41 C    How much can you see out of that fogged up visor?
           50:39:43 P    Oh, I can see in spots. I guess I'm in, Tom.
           50:39:48 C   Okay. It says position tether to avoid tangling.
                        I don't know whether you can do that or not.
           50:39:53 P   Yes. I did that already.
           50:39:56 C   Okay. ELSS Power circuit breakers coming OPEN,
                        Gene.
           50:40:03 C   MARK.
           50:40:04 C   ELSS Power circuit breaker OPEN.
           50:40:05 P   Okay. I guess the light went off. I didn't even
                        know whether it was on.
           50:40:08 C   Okay. Verify the availability of AMU electrical
                        umbilical and change from Spacecraft to AMU
                        electrical systems. Now do you want to hang on
                        and get rested before you do that?
           50:40:20 P   How are we doing on time?
           50:40:23 C   We're about 3 minutes behind on a 10-minute
                        schedule.
           50:40:27 C   That's right. Just sit there and rest, Gene. You
                        just take it easy. If we're going to have any
                        trouble with visibility on loosening electrical

	Page 233

                      parts, let's just take our time.
        50:40:36 C    I'll leave the decision up to you whether you want
                      to change that ... let's take a rest.
        50:40:46 P    Roger. We're at ceiling and laying here sideways.
        50:40:48 C    Yes, I can imagine.
        50:40:53 C    You have it on still in high-flow?
        50:40:58 P    Still reading about 3.9, Tom.
        50:41:00 C    Okay. Good.
        50:41:03 C    How is the suit temperature, pretty hot?
        50:41:05 P    It's warm enough.
        50:41:06 C    Okay.
        50:41:08 P    Remember now, I've only got one tether hook connected;
                      that's a 125-footer.
        50:41:12 C    Yes. You're still connected to the umbilical,
                      though?
        50:41:14 P    Right.
        50:41:20 C    Carnarvon, Gemini IX.
        50:41:22 C    We had a lot of difficulty hooking up those two -
                      those tether hooks and working up a heat load so the
                      only one we have hooked up is the 125-footer. It's
                      still hooked to the umbilical.
        50:41:32 CC   Carnarvon understands.
        50:41:44 P    I'm just sitting here resting a minute, Tom.
        50:41:46 C    Take your time, Gene.
        50:41:48 C    Is the visor starting to clear?
        50:41:50 P    If I don't breathe.
        50:41:56 P    But I don't recommend that.
	Page 234

           50:42:03 CC  Carnarvon's coming up on LOS, Gemini IX.
           50:42:10 P   Okay, Tom. I'll go ahead and make the electrical
                       changeover.
           50:42:11 C   Roger. Carnarvon. We're going to make the
                       electrical changeover. He's had a little bit of
                        a rest and our ECS O<sub>2</sub> is 41 percent. Relay that
                        on to Houston so they can make a recommendation
                        to us when we hit Canton.
           50:42:24 CC  We're real happy with that, Tom.
           50:42:27 C    Okay. Real good.
           50:42:29 P    Okay, Tom. Here comes the electrical changeover.
           50:42:32 C    Okay.
                   C    We'll go back to the electrical umbilical ...
                   C    Houston, Gemini IX.
                   CC   Houston is here, Gemini IX. We're reading you
                        pretty weak. Go ahead.
                   CC   Gemini IX, Houston. Go ahead.
                   C    ... computer ...
           50:59:04 C    Very good.
           50:59:13 C    ...
           50:59:19 C   Hello, Houston. Gemini IX.
           50:59:23 CC  Gemini IX, Hawaii.
           50:59:24 C   Roger, Hawaii. Would you relay to Houston for me?
           50:59:27 CC  Roger. Go ahead.
           50:59:29 C   We had about 4 or 5 times more work than what we
                        anticipated and the Pilot's visor is completely
                        fogged over, nearly frozen into him. I'm having
                        him stay there and just relax. Also, our communications
                        are very poor. He has a lot of garble.

	Page 235

                      Every transmission I can barely read. Also, the
                      attitude controller arm malfunctioned completely.
                      If the situation doesn't improve - also, he's having
                      trouble getting the restraint harness hooked-up ...
                      call it NO-GO on the AMU. We'll stay here and rest
                      for awhile. If he gets them pulled up we'll take a
                      good look at it. If it does clear up right away,
                      we'll go back to the first ... electrical umbilical
                      and call it NO-GO on AMU. Over.
        51:00:17 CC   Roger. Copy.
        51:00:19 C    Relay that to Houston.
        51:00:20 CC   Roger.
        51:00:30 C    See if you can get the reading on the umbilical.
        51:00:33 CC   Say again, Gemini IX.
        51:00:35 C    Very good, Hawaii. Go.
        51:00:40 CC   Were you calling, Gemini IX?
        51:00:42 C    I was talking to the Pilot.
        51:00:43 CC   Roger.
        51:00:45 C    The Pilot has already made the electrical connection
                      to the AMU.
        51:00:54 CC   Roger. Copy. He has made the electrical connection
                      to the AMU.
        51:00:58 C    That's affirmative. That's the only connection he
                      has made and he's fogged over completely.
        51:01:04 CC   Roger. I'll relay this to Houston.
        51:01:06 C    When the sun gets back there, also - his communications
                      to me are very poor and garbled.
        51:01:11 CC   Roger.
        51:01:14 C    Right now getting ... to the back and hoping for
                      less fog.

	Page 236

            51:01:18 CC   Roger.
            51:01:37 C    Gemini IX to Houston. Better check the right-hand
                          hatch. It is weak. It's fairly free to move for
                          the first couple of degrees.
            51:01:50  CC  Roger. You say the right hand hatch moves freely?
            51:01:53  C   Right. ... of course it moved freely when it became
                          nearly closed.
            51:02:02  CC  Roger. Understand.
            51:02:05  C   Okay, Gene. How are you doing?
            51:02:09  C   ... up about 25 degrees.
            51:02:28  P   Okay. ... just let me relax.
            51:02:37  C   Well, can you see out at all? Can you see out at
                          all, Gene? Okay ... be okay. Okay. This is
                          your chance ... Okay. You can't get anywhere.
                          I'll tell Houston NO-GO. Still fogged up and can't
                          get the arm controller unstowed on the ... When
                          you can see enough, switch back to the Spacecraft
                          electrical umbilical.

                                 HAWAII

            51:03:29  C   Hawaii, Gemini IX.
            51:03:31  CC  Gemini IX, Hawaii.
            51:03:32  C   I'm giving a NO-GO for AMU. Pilot's fogged up
                          completely. The AMU transmitter is garbled. I
                          can barely read it. The attitude controller arm
                          will not unstow to the proper position and I want
                          him to switch back to the Spacecraft electrical
                          umbilical.
            51:03:49  CC  Okay. We have that.
            51:03:52  C   He had to spend 4 to 5 times more energy than what
                          we had ... experience at zero g in the airplane.

	Page 237

         51:04:01 CC   Roger. Understand. And Houston agrees with the
                       NO-GO.
         51:04:04 C    Roger.
         51:04:12 C    Roger. We've also been working with one light.
                       We have one EVA light good and only one pen light
                       good.
         51:04:44 C    Roger. Hawaii. Gene said to pass on that he hated
                       to do it but he doesn't have any choice and neither
                       do I.
         51:04:49 CC   Roger. We understand.
         51:05:18 C    Let me know when you get ready to switch back to
                       the electrical umbilical.
         51:05:20 P    I'm on it now. I'm going to try to get out of this
                       thing now, if I can.
         51:05:28 C    Okay.
         51:05:33 P    I'm still fogged up.
         51:05:37 C    Did you read us, Hawaii, on our transmission?
         51:05:42 CC   Roger. We copy.
         51:05:44 C    Roger. He's had a little difficulty getting out
                       of the AMU. He's still fogged up. He's ...
                       Spacecraft electrical umbilical.
         51:05:50 CC   Roger. We copy.
         51:05:59 P    Okay, Tom. I'm unfogging in the middle a little
                       bit. Okay. You better turn off the attitude
                       control systems, I guess. I'll try and come around
                       the adapter.
         51:06:20 C    Okay. Cannot open it.
         51:06:21 P    I'm facing it, and I cannot get it open.
         51:06:24 C    Cannot get it open ....Okay. It's a NO-GO ....
         51:06:33 P    Okay. Wait a minute, Tom. I want to try one more
                       time.
	Page 238

           51:06:36 C    Oh.
           51:06:39 C    How's the fogging, Gene?
           51:06:41 P    Still about 75 percent fogged.
           51:06:43 C    Okay.
           51:06:45 P    Okay, Tom. I do have the outer ... doors open now.
           51:06:49 C    Well, what do you want to do? Do you want to call
                         it quits?
           51:06:52 P    I'm still fogged up. I don't know what I can get
                         out of it.
           51:06:55 C    Okay. Come on out of it.
           51:07:14 C    Turn it off ...
           51:07:23 P    ...
           51:07:53 C    ... Do you want to come on inside or do you want
                         to wait out there a little while? ...
           51:08:09 P    ...
           51:08:44 C    ...
           51:08:54 P    It's still fogged up.
           51:08:56 C    Okay.
           51:09:00 CC   Gemini IX, Houston standing by.
           51:09:03 C    ... Houston. We got Gene back in the hatch. He's
                         still completely fogged up.
           51:09:08 CC   We're with you, Tom.
           51:09:11 C    ...
           51:09:17 P    ... Get some of this stuff in here and stay in here
                         for a minute and see what happens.
           51:09:24 C    Okay. Why don't you just stand there and relax for
                         awhile, Gene?  Let me know when you get unfogged.

	Page 239

        51:09:32 P    ...
        51:09:45 P    Sorry about that AMU.
        51:09:46 C    Yes.
        51:09:49 P    ... Take her around again so we could have seen.
        51:10:02 C    ... unfogged, Gene? Okay, Houston. Sun is up
                      pretty high overhead and Gene is still fogged over.
                      How do you read?
        51:10:12 CC   Roger. We're reading you loud and clear now, Tom.
        51:10:14 C    Okay. Hated to call it quits with that AMU but we
                      had no choice.
        51:10:20 CC   Roger. We concur.
        51:10:35 P    ...
        51:10:38 C    Still fogged?
        51:10:39 P    Still about 50 percent fogged over.
        51:10:42 C    Roger ....
        51:10:43 P    Did you get this?
        51:10:51 C    What about for the nighttime? ... In case you go
                      into a fog we can take you ... if you do we're going
                      to cut it off.
        51:10:58 P    How much time do we have to go to nighttime?
        51:11:00 C    We have ...
        51:11:03 P    Okay. I'm either re-fogged or I'm staying fogged
                      right now.
        51:11:12 CC   Tom, this is Houston. You might have Gene check
                      his emergency bottle pressure when he gets a
                      chance.
        51:11:19 C    Roger. We will ... he's on HIGH RATE, Neil, and
                      he is still foggy.

	Page 240

            51:11:26  CC  Roger. When he can see well enough to read that
                          bottle pressure, we'd like to get an idea what it
                          is.
            51:11:31  C   Roger. Will do.
            51:11:35  C   Gene, can you read your emergency... pressure on
                          the check?
            51:11:40  P   Yes, about 6800.
            51:11:43  C   Houston. Did you copy? 6800.
            51:11:45  CC  Roger. Very good.
            51:11:49  P   Hey. Looks like there's an airplane in the contrails
                          down there.
            51:11:53  C   Could you see real well?
            51:11:54  P   I can see right through my nose but I can't see in
                          front of my eyeballs.
            51:12:01  C   We're coming up on LA. I've got the frost-free
                          type.
            51:12:12  CC  That's some kind of a first, Tom.
            51:12:15  C    ... I'll have to agree with you.
            51:12:19  P   Hey, Tom, what's that guy doing with the Texas
                          driver's license out there on the California
                          highway?
            51:12:24 C   Which freeway?
            51:12:26  P   There. That motorcycle.
            51:12:28  C   The Golden Gate Freeway?
            51:12:29 P   Yes.
            51:12:34  C   Okay, Gene. Now much can you see out now?
            51:12:36  P   Okay. My left eye I can see through, and I can
                          see over my nose. The whole right side and extreme
                          left side are still fogged.

	Page 241

        51:12:43  C   Okay, Houston. He can just see through his nose
                      and one little hole in his left eye. And I can
                      see in the mirror he's pretty well fogged over to
                      about 60 to 70 percent of his visor.
        51:12:53  CC  Roger, Tom. And we're copying Gene pretty good too.
        51:12:57  C   Okay.
        51:13:02  P   I am going to take a little rest, Tom.
        51:13:04  C   Okay. You take a little rest now. In fact, we'll
                      be passing right over LA.
        51:13:21  C   Okay, Gene. How about feeling the hatch. Put your
                      finger there and feel the hatch ... to see what it's
                      like.
        51:13:27  P    ...
        51:13:29  C   Okay, Bill ....
        51:13:33  CC  Roger, Tom.
        51:13:50  P   ... let me sit here for a minute.
        51:13:56  P   The left side has cleared up pretty well ....
                      pressure gage is 80 percent fogged over. I can
                      see it's still reading somewhere around 4 psi.
        51:14:51  P   Hey, Neil. You might tell everyone down there
                      that's concerned, that I'm sure sorry about this.
        51:14:59  CC  Houston, Tom. Tell him we're not concerned a bit.
        51:15:04 C    Well, it was the only way we could play it and
                      the safest way.
        51:15:09 P    I'd like - while I'm standing here I might brief
                      you. The umbilical did hang out, by the way.
                      One armrail was deployed, the footrail was deployed,
                      the left armrail and the umbilical guard
                      were not deployed. They were hung up with the ...
                      I was able to get back there without any problem.
                      I say it was just hanging loose and I sprung the
                      ... loose and the armrail came out and the umbilical
                      guard came out, so I was ... away. I had the
	Page 242

                        starboard EVA light back there. I had one pen
                        light. I think one of the problems was that just
                       before sunset I bet my backpack must have gotten
                        over 100 degrees because it was really hot. And
                        right after it got cold, my visor started fogging
                       up and I could do part of the things with the
                        fogged visor, but I just couldn't see enough of
                       what I was trying to get at when the visor fogged
                       completely over.
           51:16:11 CC   Tom, we copy.
           51:16:13 P   And it's still not clear. I guess about 40 percent
                        fogged right now on the eye level.
           51:16:21 C    It looks just about clear here. The sun's pretty
                       high anyway.
           51:16:27 P    I'd like to ask Houston ... just stand here now.
                       My pressure gage is still fogged and it's around
                        4 psi.
           51:16:36 C    Okay. One thing, how about getting the docking
                       mirror back in.
           51:16:42 P   You want that out of there?
           51:16:44 C    Yes. We want it out of there.
           51:16:46 P    Okay. I'll go up and get it.
           51:17:26 C   You bet.
           51:17:37 P   I'm slipping forward, forward to do it. I am
                        coming up on it....hold it, please ...
           51:19:53 C    ... phase we've got about 31 minutes left. If
                       you've fogged up, I don't want you to try it.
           51:20:12 P    I'm fogging up again and working here in high-flow.
           51:20:15 C   Houston, Gemini IX.
           51:20:17 CC  Houston, Go.
           51:20:19 C    Okay. Just started happening. He started fogging
                       up when he went up to retrieve the docking bar.

	Page 243

                      I'm going to make the recommendation that we retrieve
                      this before sunset.
        51:20:28 CC   Roger. We agree with that, Tom.
        51:20:31 C    Okay. He is still out there taking pictures,
                      basically. Except we're having trouble closing
                      the hatch and we're going to go ahead and close
                      the hatch.
        51:20:48 C    ...
        51:20:54 C    Okay. Come on. (Laughter)
        51:20:57 P    That's what I need - a ballet lesson.
        51:20:58 C    ... no, legs together- legs together...
        51:21:09 P    ...
        51:21:29 CC   How are you doing?
        51:21:30 C    We're doing good, Gene. I've got the ... umbilical
                      ... Probably take us to sunset.
        51:21:43 C    Houston, Gemini IX. Give our regrets to Dr. Knapp.
                      I see just no other way to play it.
        51:21:48 CC   Roger.
        51:21:50 P    Did you get through?
        51:21:51 C    Yes.
        51:22:32 P    ... forward ...
        51:22:37 C    There you go.
        51:22:43 P    ... Tom. I'm really fogged up. I guess I'm
                      getting more fogged up.
        51:22:49 C    Okay, Houston. He continues to get more fogged up
                      just from standing here. We may have green glass.
        51:22:56 CC   Roger. We concur.
        51:22:58 P    Okay, Tom. How does it look down there?

	Page 244

                    51:23:07         C        Pretty good.
                    51:23:21         P        Tom.
                    51:23:22         C        I'll see you, Gene.
                    51:23:25         P        Okay.  There it goes.
                    51:23:34         C        Still fogging, right?
                    51:23:36         P        Still fogging.
                    51:23:37         C        Still fogging on HIGH RATE?  39 percent. Okay.
                    51:23:43         CC       Houston. Roger.
                    51:23:46         C        Put your left foot forward.
                    51:24:01         P        ...
                    51:24:04         C        ...
                    51:24:11         CC       Hey, Tom. Did you bring the EVA camera in?
                    51:24:15         C        We did, Neil.  I've got it in.
                    51:24:16         CC       Okay.  Good.
                    51:24:18         C        You look pretty good.
                    51:24:28         P        Boy! Am I tired!
                    51:24:30         C        He's starting to fog now, Houston.
                    51:24:38         P        ... at about a ...
                    51:24:55         P        I'm starting to fog up at eye level.  Hey, Houston,
                                               ... this way.  My face towards you.
                    51:25:19         P        I don't think I'll make it that way.
                    51:26:53         C        Houston. That hatch was harder to close than we
                                              thought it would.
                    51:26:56         CC       Roger. We've got about 5 minutes to Antigua LOS,
                                              Tom.
	Page 245

        51:27:02 C    ... film ... they let it go.
        51:27:33 C    We are having a very big deal getting this hatch
                      closed. I don't think I'd like to do this again,
                      would you?
        51:27:46 P    No, I wouldn't.
        51:28:45 C    Let's take a rest before closing the hatch.
        51:28:50 CC   Roger. We got about 3 minutes yet and then there
                      will be 8 minutes before you get to RKV.
        51:28:56 C    Roger.
        51:29:01 P    ...
        51:30:00 P    Is that the last one?
        51:30:03 C    ...
        51:30:20 P    Message for you.
        51:30:23 C    Okay, Houston. We've got the hatch closed.
        51:30:27 CC   Good work, Tom.
        51:30:30 P    ... place for it but ...
        51:30:39 C    Don't push it. It's got to be pulled.
        51:30:52 P    ... don't pull anymore.
        51:30:53 C    Whooppee!
        51:30:54 P    Is that it?
        51:30:55 C    Yes, we've got the hatch locked.
        51:30:58 CC   Good, Tom. Glad to hear that. You've got about a
                      minute yet and then it's about 4 minutes until RKV.
        51:31:05 P    Let's pressurize this cabin, Tom. Close the valve.
        51:31:07 C    Okay.
        51:31:25 P    I think we got the last one now. Is that it?

	Page 246

            51:31:42  P   What are you doing?
            51:32:06  C   Okay, Houston. Cabin pressure starting up. 1/2
                          inch.
            51:32:13  P   Okay. Put the ...
            51:32:17  CC  Houston copies.

                                 ROSE KNOT VICTOR

            51:35:23  C    ... fog pusher.
            51:35:26  P   Oh, man! Solid, Tom!
            51:35:31  CC  Gemini IX, RKV. Standing by.
            51:35:34  C   ... to RKV. Our cabin pressure is 2 and building
                          up.
            51:35:39  CC  Roger. Copy.
            51:35:40  C   Just thought you would be interested in knowing
                          that the Pilot was completely fogged over.
            51:35:46  CC  Roger.
            51:35:48  C   ... and he's still fogged over.
            51:35:51  C   Pressure is up to about 2-1/4.
            51:35:54  CC  Roger.
            51:35:58  P   RKV, I hope you were smiling.
            51:36:03  CC  Roger. We are.
            51:36:06  P   So are we, believe it or not.
            51:36:11  C   I think we've learned a lot. ... learned a lot.
            51:36:14  CC  That's affirm.
            51:36:20  P   I can tell you one thing, Tom - that once I was
                          back there, my chances were about 50-50.

	Page 247

         51:36:31 C    More like 70-30.
         51:36:44 P    Back there I couldn't see anything, and the sunlight
                       on one side, and visor was so fogged I couldn't see
                       anything.
         51:37:05 P    ... I could hear you, but only in spots.
         51:37:10 P    Did you push the audio tone?
         51:37:20 P    I could read you loud and clear when I could read
                       you, but I could tell you were talking and I didn't
                       get anything at all.
         51:37:26 CC   Gemini IX, RKV.
        51:37:28  C    RKV, Gemini IX.
        51:37:30  CC   Roger. Would you turn your ECS O<sub>2</sub> Manual Heater
                       ON?
        51:37:37  P    That's Cabin Pressure, ON, Tom.
        51:37:43  P    Let me know when ...
        51:37:52  C    Cabin pressure 3.13.
        51:37:55  CC  Roger.
        51:38:07  P   Darn. I should be able ...
        51:38:43  C   Okay ... RKV, Gemini IX. We're up to 4 psi.
        51:38:48  CC  Roger. Copy.
        51:38:54  P   RKV, Gemini IX.
        51:38:56  CC  Go, IX.
        51:38:58  P   You might ask Houston whether or not they have any
                      more D-14's planned for us. If they do, we'd better
                      just take the first one and take a look at it because
                      I broke off the antenna.
        51:39:08  CC  Roger.
        51:39:29 P    We're pressurized, Tom. I can't get the visor open.
	Page 248

            51:39:38  C   Yes. I would.
            51:39:41  P   Or take it off. One or the other. I can't get it
                          off.
            51:39:57  CC  Gemini IX, RKV. We'll have LOS in about a minute.
            51:40:01  C   Roger.
            51:40:09  P   RKV, it's going to take us quite a while to clean
                          house here.
            51:40:18  CC  Say again, please?
            51:40:20  P   It'll take us a few hours to clean house here.
            51:40:22  CC  Roger.
            51:40:51  C   How are you doing?
            51:41:56  CC  Gemini IX, Houston standing by.
            51:42:01  C   Roger, Houston. Our cabin pressure is 5.5, and
                          for your information, Gene fogged over completely
                          during the Ingress Maneuver.
            51:42:14  CC  Houston copies.
            51:42:15  C   Okay. ... all squared away.
            51:42:29  CC  Houston copies.
            51:42:49  C   ... in the wrong direction.

            51:56:10  C   ...
            51:56:17  CC  Okay. We're having trouble talking to you over
                          this station again. We'll be standing by.
            51:56:21  C    ...

        52:02:07  CC  Gemini IX, Houston. If you read, we're recommending,
                      after you get the cockpit cleaned,that you have an
                      eat period for the - about the next hour.
        52:02:23  C   Tananarive ...
        52:30:37  CC  Gemini IX, this is CSQ Surgeon. We have full-scale.
        52:30:45  CC  Gemini IX, this is CSQ Surgeon. We have all blood
                      pressure, exercise. Give me a Mark.
        52:30:52  P   Roger.
        52:30:53  P   MARK.
        52:31:11  CC  Gemini IX, CSQ Surgeon. Your cuff is full-scale.
        52:36:39  CC  Gemini IX, Hawaii.
        52:36:42  P   Go ahead, Hawaii.
        52:36:43  CC  Okay. We have three small items for you, if you
                      have the time.
        52:36:47 P    To write down?
        52:36:48 CC   Negative.
        52:36:50 P    Okay. Go ahead.
        52:36:51 CC   We'd like for you to check RCS Ring A No. 1 Pitch
                      circuit breaker - see if it's CLOSED.
        52:37:00 P    It was OPEN.
        52:37:02 CC   Okay. We see it on the ground. And we'd like to
                      verify the T/M switch in the REAL-TIME and ACQ AID
                      positions.
        52:37:09 P    Okay. It's in REAL-TIME and ACQ AID now.
        52:37:12 CC   Roger. Would you go to the EXPERIMENT position on
                      the Propellant Indicator switch and give us a read-out
                      pressure and temperature on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>?
        52:37:21 P    Okay. It looks like we bang a few switches around
                      here, don't we? It's reading 460 right now -
	Page 250

                          pressure- and 65 degrees Fahrenheit temperature,
                          and our question is probably what you've been
                          considering. Do you want us to get rid of it or
                          not?
            52:37:40 CC   They'll talk to you over the States about that.
            52:37:43 P    Okay.
            52:37:49 P    Any circuit breakers we kicked around?
            52:37:51 CC   We don't see any from here.
            52:37:57 CC   Everything else looks real good.
            52:37:59 P    Okay. Thank you.
            52:38:01 CC   We'll be standing by.
            52:38:06 P    You can tell Houston they'll probably see our water
                          consumption go up rapidly.
            52:38:10 CC   Say again.
            52:38:12 P    You can tell Houston they'll probably see our water
                          consumption go up rapidly.
            52:38:15 CC   I don't doubt it.

            52:39:30 CC   Gemini IX, Hawaii.
            52:39:31 C    Roger. I'd like to have somebody give us an accurate
                          readout on our latest Propellant Quantity, please.
            52:39:36 CC   Roger.
            52:39:41 CC   We'd like an on-board Prop Quantity readout.
            52:39:45 C    Okay. By knocking out the parallax, I'd say 4 percent,
                          maybe 3.

	Page 251

         52:40:05 C    Go.
         52:40:07 CC   They'll be giving you some updates on these
                       quantities over the States.
         52:40:12 C    Roger.
         52:43:04 CC   Gemini IX, Hawaii. We have 1 minute to LOS and
                       standing by.
         52:43:08 C    Roger, Hawaii.
         52:43:55 CC   Hawaii has LOS.

         52:44:54 C    Houston, Gemini IX. Go.
         52:44:56 CC   Roger, Tom. We'd like to have from Gene his best
                       recollection of the configuration of the AMU at the
                       time he left; that is, in terms of connections,
                       tether, arms, the valves, et cetera.
         52:45:20 P    Houston. Can you read us okay? We're reading you
                       garbled.
         52:45:23 CC   Okay. We're reading you loud and clear, so go
                       ahead.
         52:45:26 P    Okay. I'm not sure of all you asked for, but when
                       I went back there after I closed the hatch, I went
                       back over the top all the way down to the handrails
                       and - -
         52:45:35 CC   Stand by.
         52:45:37 CC   Stand by.
         52:45:39 P    - - Extend the attitude controller arms.
         52:45:41 CC   Stand by.
         52:45:42 P    Saw the umbilical guard come over the back of the

	Page 252

                            adapter, so I figured that they did not extend.
              52:45:47 CC   Stand by.
              52:45:51 CC   Do you read it? Do you read, Houston?
              52:45:54 P    Houston, do you read?
              52:45:55 CC   Yes. What we want to know, Gene, is the configuration
                            of that AMU as it is now. Right now, as best
                            you know it.
              52:46:02 P    Okay. The AMU, as it is now, has the Oxygen valve,
                            OPEN, Hydrogen valve, OPEN. On my gage, I have 80
                            percent peroxide quantity. The Battery switch is
                            ON.
              52:46:26 CC   Okay. How about the arm and the tether?
              52:46:37 C    Houston, Gemini IX. You're coming in broken.
              52:46:40 CC   Roger. We got all that. We'd like to have the
                            condition of the arm, the umbilical and the tether -
                            the restraint.
              52:46:51 P    Down.
              52:46:54 P    The attitude control arm is up and locked. It's
                            in the flyable position. The tether was discarded,
                            and it cleared the Spacecraft.
              52:47:09 CC   Roger.
              52:47:21 CC   Say again the position of the left arm.
              52:47:26 P    The left arm is down. Not locked, but all the
                            way down.
              52:47:31 CC   Roger. All the way down.
              52:47:32 CC   Now, how about any other electrical or hoses?
              52:47:41 CC   Are they still curved to the pack, or are they
                            loose or what?
              52:47:46 P    The tin hose is Velcroed to the - to the arm controller.
                            The restraint harness on both sides is
	Page 253

                     Velcroed to the arm controller, and the electrical
                     connection, I believe, is Velcroed. I think I've
                     got it back down but I cannot verify it.
       52:48:06 CC   Roger. We have all that.
       52:48:14 CC   Okay. For your information, the - your on-board
                     quantity indicates 20 pounds of fuel. The source
                     pressure indicates 28 pounds of fuel. The ground
                     equations indicate 35 pounds.
       52:48:30 P    Roger. We've got that. Thank you.
       52:48:32 CC   Okay. And I've got a maneuver update when you're
                     ready to copy.
       52:48:36 C    Roger. Houston, we have that. Is that fuel only
                     or is that fuel and oxidizer?
       52:48:42 C    Fuel only.
       52:48:43 C    Roger.
       52:48:44 CC   We got a - we'd like to do this Orbit Shaping to get
                     your true anomaly in the right place, if you'd agree
                     with that.
       52:48:51 C    Roger. That sounds real good, Neil.
       52:48:54 CC   Okay. We'll have that. When you're ready to copy,
                     I'll give it to you.
       52:48:58 C    Okay. Want to do that right away?
       52:49:00 CC   It will be at 53:41.
       52:49:04 C    Okay.
       52:49:06 CC   That's about an hour from now, over Tananarive.
       52:49:09 C    Okay. We've got the Platform all Alined here and
                     we are in good shape. Stand by one and we'll copy
                     it.
       52:49:15 CC   Okay. I can tell you first it's going to be a 25-
                     foot-per-second burn. We'd like to monitor your -
                     have you monitor your VW tank, your reserve tank,
                     during the burn, and if it starts to go down, you
	Page 254

                            stop your burn at that point.
              52:49:34 C    Shoot for 25 feet per second or if VW tank starts
                            down, we'll stop the burn.
             52:49:38  CC   That's right. And let us know how many feet per
                            second you burned.
             52:49:41  C    Roger.

                                  GUAYMAS

             52:49:52  C    Go ahead with the GET.
             52:49:53  CC   Okay. GET B: 53:41:35; Delta-V, 25; burn time,
                            31 seconds; yaw 180, pitch 0; Address 25, 90250;
                            Address 26, zero; 27, zero; aft thrusters; Retrograde.
                            Go ahead.
             52:50:27  C    Roger. GET Burn: 53:41:35; Delta-V, 25 feet per
                            second; Delta-T, 31 seconds burn time; yaw 180,
                            pitch 0; Address 25, 90250; 26 and 27, zeros; aft
                            thrusters; Retrograde Maneuver.
             52:50:52  CC   That is correct and you can turn your crossfeed ON.
             52:50:59  C    Crossfeed coming OPEN.
             52:51:09  CC   Our current approach is not to jettison AMU unless
                            we feel for some reason we have to.
             52:51:18  C    Roger. We were going to ask you about that. What
                            was your recommendation?
             52:51:22  CC   Well, we're sure going to keep it for awhile. I
                            want to watch these pressures and I'm sure you'll
                            be watching them too.
             52:51:29 C     Roger.
             52:51:32 C     Bob, we learned a whole lot out of the EVA. It was
                            a real worthwhile exercise.
             52:51:35 CC    Yes. We certainly agree with that.
	Page 255

           52:51:40         C       In fact, I wished you would have gotten some ...
                                    data on the previous one.
           52:51:44         CC      Say again.
           52:51:50         C       I said I'd wished you'd have been able to get this
                                    data on the previous one.
           52:51:52         CC      Yes. But it looks like you got a lot of the data
                                    we would've got.
           52:51:55         C       Yes. I think it was still a real fine exercise.
                                    We hated to give up the AMU portion of it, but we
                                    did do some good umbilical evaluation and we got
                                    some pictures. We also got a lot of thermal inputs
                                    to give back to the people.
           52:52:11         CC      Yes. We can see that it was very valuable. You
                                    know the EVA bottle is empty.  
           52:52:19         P       Thanks a lot.
           52:52:20         C       Thanks a lot, Dick.
           52:52:22         P       Still batting 500, Dick, but a lot smarter.
           52:52:26         CC      Yes. You did good work, friend.
           52:52:29         P       You don't know how much.
           52:52:31         CC      Yes, I do. I was watching you.
           52:52:36         CC      The Surgeon told me.
           52:52:39         C       Houston, Gemini IX. Would you give us a time
                                    hack, please?
           52:52:41         CC      Roger. It will be 52:45.
           52:52:45         CC      MARK.
           52:52:48         C       Right on.

                                                TEXAS

           52:53:20         CC      Okay. Tom, we're expecting this AMU pressure to go

	Page 256

                            up and it may go up over 500. Then it's conceivable
                            that you could get a light here sometime
                            along the way.
              52:53:37 C    Okay.
              52:53:38 C    We'll think on it, Neil.
              52:53:40 CC   Okay. We're going to be thinking about it some
                            more on the ground here.
              52:53:46 C    Roger.
              52:54:14 CC   Looks like, Tom, that we are not planning to
                            jettison the AMU, even if that light does come on.
                            However, in the configuration you have it - we
                            don't see any reason why we won't be able to
                            jettison it if, for some reason, we have to.
             52:54:33 C     Roger.
             52:56:18 CC    Houston is about a minute from LOS
             52:56:22 P     Roger, Neil. We'll be set up and we'll make the
                            burn according to instructions.
             52:56:28 CC    Right. The guys down here think you made a real
                            good show there, Gene.
             52:56:34 P     Like I say, I feel I'm only batting 500 but that's
                            better than nothing.
             52:56:40 CC    We're with you.
             52:56:45 P     Tom thinks I need some ballet lessons.
             52:56:48 CC    (Laughter)
             52:56:52 CC    You want me to give them to you?
             52:56:56 P     Not exactly.

	Page 257

      53:08:55  C    RKV, Gemini IX.
      53:08:57  CC   Roger. Could you do a Fuel cell purge for us at
                     this time?
      53:09:02  C    ...
      53:09:12  CC   We'd like to have you do a Section 1 purge and
                     then a Section 2.
       53:09:46 P    Okay, RKV. I'm with you now. You want Section 1
                     first?
       53:09:51 CC   That's affirm.
       53:10:01 P    Okay. Purging hydrogen, Section 1.
       53:10:04 C    Roger. We understand.
       53:10:20 P    Purge hydrogen in Section 2.
       53:10:22 CC   Roger.
       53:10:25 P    Fuel cells have been working real good up here.
       53:10:28 CC   They're running real beautiful down here. This is
                     the nicest I've ever seen fuel cells running.
       53:10:41 P    And we're on the oxygen purge, Section 1.
       53:10:43 CC   Roger.
       53:10:46 P    They've been holding very well here. Voltages
                     have been holding on good. Very well balanced.
       53:10:52 CC   Yes. I've never seen one before that ran this
                     close on the current. Hold really in there.
       53:11:22 CC   Gemini IX, RKV. When you get a chance, could you
                     give us a water gun count, please?
                P    Roger. Water gun now reads 2706.
                CC   Roger. Copy 2706.
                P    We're starting on this ATDA Command Signaling.
       53:12:47 P    Gemini IX. We're now purging oxygen, Section 2.

	Page 258

              53:12:51 CC   Roger. Right with you.
              53:12:53 P    And the AMU tank pressure is holding.
              53:12:56 CC   Roger.
              53:14:38 CC   Gemini IX, RKV. Just for your information, we
                            turned the L-Band beacon OFF on the ATDA and we
                            also turned ACQ lights ON on the ATDA. We are
                            pretty well powering the ATDA up.
              53:14:53 P    Roger. Can you give us an idea where it is in our
                            relation now to where it will be after our burn?
              53:15:00 CC   Roger. Stand by.
              53:15:16 CC   Last information we have here on the ground is
                            that - Houston's going to get a better look at it
                            now - is that it should be a slightly higher orbit
                            than what you have. It should be about - was 185
                            miles long.
              53:15:32 P    Okay. Thank you.
              53:15:43 CC   Okay. Would you place your Quantity Read switch
                            to the - let's see - FUEL CELL O<sub>2</sub> position?
             53:15:54  P    Okay. FUEL CELL O<sub>2</sub>.
             53:16:20  CC   Flight just advised that the ATDA is 160 miles
                            behind you.
             53:16:26  P    Roger. And the transponder's ON?
             53:16:29  CC   That's affirm.
             53:16:31  P    Okay. We'll do a little interrogating here.
             53:16:33  CC   Roger. We notice you have your radio on.
             53:16:36  P    Okay. Will you give us FUEL CELL H<sub>2</sub> quantity,
                            please?
             53:16:40  CC   FUEL CELL H<sub>2</sub>.
             53:16:48  CC   Okay. You can go back to ECS O<sub>2</sub>.
	Page 259

      53:16:52 P    ECS O<sub>2</sub>.
      53:17:12 CC   You can even turn it off if you want to, or however
                    you want to leave it.
      53:17:29 P    This is IX. How is the hydrogen quantity holding
                    up?
      53:17:34 CC   Our transducer has failed and we're not getting
                    any indication down here on the ground on it so - -
      53:24:03 C    Gemini IX recording at 53:23:59. We have radar
                    lock-on with the ATDA, 159.12 miles.
      53:24:10 P    Solid.
      53:24:11 C    Solid lock.
      53:24:16 P    Looks like the angle's down - that can't be, can
                    it?
      53:24:23 P    Down about minus 4 or 5 degrees.
      53:24:31 C    ... radar in attitude ...
      53:24:33 P    What?
      53:24:34 P    Yes. I am in radar now. Looks about 4 or 5
                    degrees.
      53:24:39 P    And that says 12 feet per second.
      53:24:41 C    That's about right.
      53:24:45 P    Pitch down about 5 degrees, 159.17 miles. We just
                    lost lock. Just got lock on again. Pretty good,
                    you know it?
      53:25:15 P    Yes. We're opening, Tom, at 2 feet per second now,
                    but that may not be the right reading.
      53:25:24 P    It's 159.20 miles.
      53:25:31 P    Just lost lock. Just got lock back. 5 feet per
                    second, opening.
      53:25:39 P    Lock. We're losing, gaining, getting lock,

	Page 260

                            intermittently. Most of the time it's on and now
                            it's off again.
              53:25:52 P    Remember, this has to be stowed back up here, Tom.
                            There's no use for the camera box S-12.
              53:26:04 P    This is Gemini IX. GET at 53 hours, 26 minutes.
                            We have radar lock on the ATDA, 159.28 miles.
                            Pitch down about 3 degrees and we're opening at 2
                            feet per second.
              53:26:30 C    Do you have your swizzle stick over there?

              53:30:32 CC   Gemini IX, this is Houston. How do you read?
             53:30:35  P    Gemini IX. We read you loud and clear. A lot of
                            noise going on ...
             53:30:41  P    ...
             53:30:48  CC   Gene, you're coming in very garbled. I've got
                            some dope for you, though. Your H<sub>2</sub> quantity is
                            around 40 to 46 percent and is okay. We're getting
                            a Flight Plan update ready and we'll send it up at
                            Hawaii. Over.
             53:31:05  P    Roger. Understand. Flight Plan update at Hawaii
                            and H<sub>2</sub> quantity is okay.
             53:31:11  C    And what about ...
             53:32:16  P    Gemini IX. At GET of 53 hours 32 minutes. We're
                            opening at 2 feet per second. Range is now 159
                            miles, 159.92 miles - at 10 feet per second.
             53:39:04  P    This is Gemini IX. It's now 160.88 miles. Range-Rate
                            is 17 feet per second. It's 53:39 and we're
                            standing by to make our burn.
             53:41:14  C    Okay. We have just burnt. Coming into 53:41.
	Page 261

       53:41:28 P    Okay. I'll watch the regulated pressure and time
                     to burn.
       53:41:36 C    32, 33, 34, 35, BURN.
       53:41:48 P    Regulator pressure is holding, Tom. 13 feet to
                     go; 10 to go; starting to drop.
       53:41:59 C    290 to 330. Did you make it?
       53:42:07 P    Okay, Tom. Burn was 29 seconds and we're at 295.
                     She dropped to 290 so she's - I think we're right
                     at that point.
       53:42:23 C    Good show! We've got 25 feet per second before
                     that.
       53:42:26 P    Want to interrogate 81, 82? Says 3 feet per second,
                     Tom, 82 down. We want to go 3-feet-per-second
                     down. Still got 2 to go.
       53:42:50 C    Let it go. What do we have?
       53:42:56 P    Okay. At that point.
       53:43:00 C    ...
       53:43:14 P    Will you give me that book to write on? That one
                     right there is good enough. That little one where
                     the burn is.
       53:43:24 C    This one?
       53:43:26 P    I know it. 81 is plus 6, 82 is 2.2, 80 is minus
                     1.3. Okay?
       53:43:56 P    See. It's just starting to go down, Tom.
       53:44:02 P    Okay. We've made our fuel nominal burn and - to
                     the ATDA at 53:46, it's 161.34 miles. Range-Rate
                     is 5 feet-per-second, closing at the moment. It
                     appears that the needles show pitch down about 2
                     degrees.
       53:44:40 C    Okay. Now I know the rates.
       53:44:48 P    I think that's got it. Anytime you say you're ready.

              53:53:32 C    Okay, CSQ. Go ahead.
              53:53:34 CC   Roger. Have you completed your maneuver?
              53:53:36 C    Roger. Maneuver has been completed on time. We
                            hit the ... times just to the west of ... pick up
                            residuals ...
              53:53:49 CC   Roger. Understand. Can you give me an OAMS Prop
                            Quantity reading, please?
              53:53:54 C    OAMS Prop Quantity I have now indicated as zero.
              53:53:59 CC   Roger. Would you give me your OAMS Reserve Tank
                            pressure?
             53:54:02  C    Roger. We have now 295.
             53:54:06  CC   Roger. Understand. We have nothing further for
                            you at this time.
             53:54:12  P    CSQ, Gemini IX.
             53:54:14  CC   Go ahead, Gemini IX. CSQ.
             53:54:16  P    Residuals on that burn were Address 80 minus 0013.
             53:54:22  CC   Roger.
             53:54:24  P    81 is 00006; 82 is 00022.
             53:54:35  CC   Okay. Would you give me an Address 81, please?
             53:54:38  P    Roger. 81 was 00006.
             53:54:43  CC   Roger. Understand. I copy.
             53:54:45  P    And just ... of burn there was an indication that
                            the OAMS regulated pressure was dropping down to
	Page 263

                     about 285 to 290. Now it's up again to around 290.
       53:55:00 CC   Roger. Understand.
       53:55:07 C    CSQ, Gemini IX. Are we supposed to get a Flight
                     Plan update at Hawaii?
       53:55:11 CC   That's affirmative, Gemini IX.
       53:55:13 C    All right. Roger.
       53:56:26 P    CSQ, Gemini IX.
       53:56:29 P    We've been reading the L-Band on the ATDA for about
                     15 minutes. The Range-Rate is very slow. We were
                     opening prior to our burn and then we started to
                     close very slowly and we are approximately 162.75
                     miles with a Range-Rate of plus 26 feet per second.
       53:56:49 CC   Roger. Understand.
       53:56:52 P    The lock-on is pretty solid. Occasionally it drops
                     out, but it looks like a pretty good lock-on.
       53:56:57 CC   Roger.
       53:57:30 C    If you will give us a Mark prior to LOS, I'll give
                     you another Range and Range-Rate...
       53:57:36 CC   Roger.
       54:00:16 CC   Gemini IX. On my Mark would you give me a Range
                     and a Range-Rate, please?
       54:00:21 C    ... Roger.
       54:00:27 CC   MARK.
       54:00:32 P    On your Mark, Range is 164.72 miles.
       54:00:43 P    Range-Rate is 51 feet per second, overtake.
       54:00:46 P    51 feet per second.
       54:00:48 CC   Roger. Understand.
       54:01:00 CC   Okay. You are just about to leave us here,

             54:11:19 CC   Gemini IX, Hawaii.
             54:11:21 C    Hello, Hawaii. Gemini IX.
             54:11:23 CC   Roger, I have a Flight Plan update for you.
             54:11:28 C    Roger. Be ready to copy in 1 minute.
             54:11:29 CC   Roger.
             54:11:45 C    Hawaii, Gemini IX. Go.
             54:11:47 CC   Roger. 54:38:34 through 54:47:28: photographs of
                           South America; 70mm Hasselblad, 80mm lens; strip
                           chart; weather and film permitting. These should
                           be nadir photographs.
             54:12:18 C    Roger.
             54:12:21 CC   55:30 - stand by. 54:57:00.This is an S-1. Start
                           with Milky Way exposures. Take two exposures of each
                           of the four horizons starting north, then west,
                           south and east. 55:30:00: Load re-entry module
                           tape; then power-down except for rate gyros.
             54:13:11 CC   Stand by, Gemini IX.
             54:13:24 CC   Gemini IX, Hawaii. That time for loading the re-entry
                           module should be approximately 55:46:37.
                           That will be Hawaii acquisition on the next revolution.
                           Also, over Hawaii, on the next revolution,
                           it's 55:46:18 crew status report. S-11: 56:49:17;

     54:15:38 C    Roger, Hawaii. Could you give us the first times
                   for the South America strip chart?
     54:15:43 CC   Roger. 54:38:34 through 54:47:28.
     54:15:59 C    Roger.
     54:16:03 CC   We'd also like for you to think about the weight
                   update of the Spacecraft at this time. Such items
                   that you have jettisoned and the amount of the O<sub>2</sub>
                   and the ELSS and such as this.
     54:16:15 C    Roger. The ELSS has approximately 1 pound of
                   oxygen left in it.
     54:16:25 CC   Roger.
     54:16:28 C    And the jettisoned items were estimated to be
                   approximately 2 pounds.
     54:16:36 CC   The number of items jettisoned should add up to
                   around 2 pounds.
     54:16:44 P    That's affirm. That's internal from the Spacecraft
                   and, of course, there was the S-12 steering
                   and the ...

     54:18:03 C    Hawaii, Gemini IX.
     54:18:05 CC   Gemini IX, Hawaii.
     54:18:07 C    I'd like to give you the status of the D-14
                   antenna.
     54:18:09 CC   Okay.
     54:18:11 C    Okay. I broke it about two-thirds of the way
                   down. I actually broke the casing; it seemed to
                   snap - semi-snap back in place. Apparently there
                   is a cable or a line through it. It's not spring-loaded
                   like the UHF nose antenna. It may or may
                   not work. I don't know whether you want to try it.

            54:18:34 CC   I believe they've canceled the rest of the D-14
                          experiment.
            54:18:37 C    Okay.
            54:18:41 CC   We're at LOS minus 1, Gemini IX.

            54:45:10 CC   Gemini IX, RKV standing by.
            54:45:12 C    Roger, RKV. We're taking a quick nap.
            54:45:14 CC   Roger.
            54:49:15 CC   Gemini IX, RKV here. For your information, I'd
                          like to have you transfer about 4 pounds of water
                          to the water boiler. That's 134 count. Start that
                          over the CSQ.
            54:49:25 C    104 counts of water to the water boiler.
            54:49:28 CC   134.
            54:49:30 C    134.
            54:49:31 CC   Affirmative.
            54:49:38 CC   RKV. That's 132 counts.
            54:49:41 CC   Correction on that, Gemini. That's 132 counts.
            54:49:50 C    Roger.
            54:50:24 C    RKV, this is Gemini IX. We'll start drinking quite
                          a bit here, too.
            54:50:28 CC   Roger.
            54:50:29 C    You want 134 - 132 more than what we have now.
            54:50:33 CC   That's affirmative.

     54:50:55 CC  Gemini IX, Houston.
     54:50:57 C   Roger, Houston. We're in the middle of a ...
     54:55:32 P   Hey, Tom! I think that would have been off.
     54:55:36 P   ... be 8.
     54:55:40 P   When I tell you, pitch up, Tom.
     54:55:46 P   Pitch up.
     54:55:54 C   Got the other one going?
     54:55:57 P   Yes. I do now. Don't thrust.
     54:56:26 C   Okay. Go on to the other horizon.
     54:56:46 P   Turn the ... back on.
     54:56:49 C   Sure glad that little fuel will do all of this.
     54:56:59 P   I am too.
     54:57:06 P   What's next on the agenda?
     54:57:34 P   Have to load the computer, so you might want to
                  bring the computer up in between times. I can
                  be here.
     54:57:40 P   Hawaii, 55:46.
     54:57:42 C   Get most of it okay?
     54:57:45 P   Yes.
     54:58:02 C   Don't have a ... How's that one?
     54:58:08 P   Very well; you've got an open.
     54:58:10 C   An open.
     54:58:12 P   No, left, don't you?

	Page 268

             54:58:14 C    No, to the right.
             54:58:52 P    Okay. Anytime.
             54:58:54 C    Okay. Looks good where...
             54:58:56 P    Okay ....
             54:58:57 C    All set?
             54:58:58 P    Anytime you say.
             54:59:00 C    Hit it.
             54:59:12 P    When I tell you, you can damp the rates, then you
                           can damp some more. You're drifting down and left.
                           Don't do anything yet.
             54:59:34 P    Okay. You can thrust. Okay. Don't do anything.
             55:00:17 C    Go on for the next one, if you'd like.
            55:01:11 P    ... over CSQ. Should work with that off the West
                           Coast.
            55:01:14  C    Yes. I know but that's - -
            55:01:17  P    Before you get to Hawaii?
            55:01:20  C    - - We'll never be able to transfer there.
            55:01:26  P    When do we get there?
            55:01:34  C    Load Module 4 down there.
            55:01:39  CC   We're having an S-11 down here. ...
            55:01:49  P    Crew status at Hawaii?
            55:01:57  CC   Okay. They're there.
            55:02:05  P    You will even get EVA. I'll tell you because - -
            55:02:07  C    You ready?
            55:02:32  P    - - When I tell you, roll left.
	Page 269

       55:03:24 C   Okay.
       55:03:27 P   You got a big spot of lightning in that, right at
                    the last.
       55:03:31 C   What did you call it?
       55:03:33 P   Big spot of lightning.
       55:03:42 C   All kinds of bumpers right now. Boy!
       55:04:04 C   The sun's coming up.
       55:04:06 P   Look at the lights down there.
       55:04:10 P   Australia, you suppose?
       55:04:12 P   Let's see now - no we must be - -
       55:04:23 C   ...
       55:04:24 P   - - Another city. Look at that one down there.
       55:05:14 P   We have everything hung up on it, Tom.
       55:05:20 P   We are over Africa, South Africa.
       55:05:25 C   This is Gemini IX.
       55:05:27 P   Up a little, Tom. No, you're all right. I guess
                    you're at 40 degrees. That's good. Anytime,
                    when you're ready.
       55:05:54 C   Okay. I've got it.
       55:05:56 CC  Gemini IX, Houston.
       55:05:59 C   Roger, Houston. We're in the middle of an S-1
                    photograph right now.
       55:06:05 CC  We have a procedure for you, if you're ready to
                    copy it.
       55:06:13 C   Stand by one. We're still on Experiment S-1.
       55:06:16 CC  Roger.
	Page 270

             55:06:20 P    Is this Gemini CAP COM?
             55:06:29 P    Go right.
             55:06:30 C    Okay.
             55:06:32 C    Procedure on 1. I wonder - -
             55:06:36 CC   This is Houston standing by. We'll send the procedure
                           up at CSQ.
             55:06:41 C    - - Roger.
             55:07:04 P    Okay.
             55:07:07 P    Don't you want to get any Milky Way pictures with
                           this?
             55:07:13 P    We've got 1 to CSQ.
             55:07:17 C    Milky Way is straight up the pipe.
             55:07:22 P    Yaw left, to the left.
             55:07:26 C    Yes.
             55:07:27 P    Yaw left more - more than your nose. Yaw to the
                           left a bit.
             55:07:42 P    Keep going left.
             55:07:51 C    See up there.
             55:07:53 P    Yes. I can see it.
             55:07:54 P    If you stop - stop it all.
             55:08:03 P    Then you'll have to tell me when you're stopped.
             55:08:09 P    Don't let it yaw any more. You're yawing too far.
             55:08:11 P    Too far. Oh, you're all right yet.
             55:08:13 P    Go.
             55:08:14 C    Okay.
	Page 271

        55:08:27 P    Still rolling left a little bit.
        55:08:30 C    Balls of fire!
        55:08:46 P    Okay. Go up the Milky Way now, if you can, Tom.
                      No matter whether it's perfect, just go up to
                      window level on the horizon. It doesn't make any
                      difference what roll you have, just so you hold it.
                      Any time.
        55:09:52 C    Okay.
        55:09:54 P    Go up some more, if you can.
        55:09:55 C    Want me to go from here?
        55:09:57 P    Just go up to that level. Go up about 30 degrees
                      high - 10 degrees high, I mean.
        55:10:22 P    Okay. Stop it somewhere in there.
        55:10:27 C    Really shooting it up.
        55:10:30 P    I've taken 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and I ruined the first
                      one; 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.
        55:10:38 P    Ready?
        55:11:09 P    Go on up some more.
        55:11:17 C    S-12.
        55:11:27 P    Yaw just a little right, you're coming too far.
                      You seem to be about 320.
        55:11:40 P    We're not getting any because of the moon. Can't
                      get anything here because of the moon. Might be
                      able to get the rest of them on another one.
        55:11:50 C    Okay.
        55:11:51 P    You ready?
       55:11:55 C     Okay.
       55:12:25  P    Okay. We can't go any higher. The moon's up
                      there.
	Page 272

             55:12:28 P    How many have we taken of the Milky Way?
             55:12:30 C    Three.
             55:12:32 P    It was four.
             55:12:33 C    Want me to take some more of the horizon while
                           we're here?
             55:12:38 P    That was four at eight to 12 ...
             55:12:49 P    Where is the tape?
             55:12:51 P    You've got this all on tape?
             55:12:54 P    Tape's been on, I guess, and you want to tell them
                           what we're doing?
             55:12:57 P    We have taken two pictures, S-1; two pictures,
                           northern horizon, western horizon, southern
                           horizon and eastern horizon. Two pictures of the
                           Milky Way; one of northeast horizon and we have
                           taken four pictures - that's a total of 12 and I
                           ruined the first shot. Pictures...
             55:13:20 P    Couldn't go any further on the horizon because the
                           moon was up there toward the beacon.
             55:13:38 C    Want to pitch down some more?
             55:13:44 P    Yes, a little bit.
             55:13:49 P    Two more pictures of the eastern horizon.
             55:13:52 C    One more picture of eastern horizon.
             55:14:11 P    And knowing now that - with my experience, EVA, I
                           can appreciate that it would have not only been
                           difficult, but impossible to hold this camera for
                           30 seconds in any one direction.
             55:14:33 C    S-1 is completed with 18 exposures. ... 56.
             55:14:44 P    Have you got the Platform Alined so we can load
                           Module 4?

       55:28:24 CC  Gemini IX, CSQ CAP COM.
       55:28:25 C   CSQ, Gemini IX. We're loading water into the
                    water boiler.
       55:28:29 CC  Roger. Could you give me the gun count prior to
                    the start?
       55:28:33 C   It was 2715.
       55:28:35 CC  Roger. And that's a 132-gun count?
       55:28:39 C   Roger. When they told us that, we started at 2175.
                    We drank quite a bit. We are now at 2747.
       55:28:49 CC  Roger. Understand. I have a module-loading procedure
                    for you when you're ready to copy.
       55:28:57 C   Okay. ... busy - we're loading the water boiler
                    right now.
       55:29:07 CC  Roger. Understand.
       55:29:09 C    ... regular procedure ... on-board.
       55:29:14 CC  Roger. This is a new procedure, Gemini IX.
       55:29:30 C   Okay, CSQ. Go ahead.
       55:29:31 CC  Roger. Step 1: Switch to CATCH-UP; clarify IVI's
                    do not drive. Step 2: set small numbers in IVI's.
                    Step 3: insert into the MDIU, Address 25, all zero;
                    Address 26, all zeros; Address 27, all zeros. Step
                    4: push START COMP IVI's, 23 to zero. Step 5:
                    switch to PRELAUNCH. Step 6: at 55:46:00 load
                    Module 4, be in automatic. Step 7: switch to REENTRY.
                    Step 8: verify Computer Run light stays
                    OFF. Step 9: switch to PRELAUNCH. Did you copy?
       55:31:27 C   Roger. Repeat Step 8, please.
       55:31:30 CC  Step 8: verify Computer Run light stays OFF.
       55:31:42 P   Roger. I'd like to read it back to you real quick.

	Page 274

            55:31:44 CC  Go.
            55:31:45 P   Number 1: switch to CATCH-UP; clarify IVI's do
                         not drive. Set small numbers in IVI. Set 25, 6
                         and 7, all zeros. Step 4 is push START COMP; IVI's
                         to zero. Step 5 PRELAUNCH. At 55:46:00, load
                         Module 4, be in the automatic. Step 7: switch to
                         REENTRY. Verify Computer light is OFF. Step 9:
                         switch to PRELAUNCH.
            55:32:15 CC  That's affirmative. And at this time I have a
                         Flight Plan update.
            55:32:21 P   Go ahead with the Flight Plan update, and if we
                         have any anomaly prior to Step 6, should we continue
                         or not?
            55:32:28 CC  Stand by one.
            55:32:35 CC  Stand by. We're checking on it. We'd like to
                         know what the anomaly is before we proceed past
                         Step 6.
            55:32:45 P   We would like to know what the anomaly is before
                         proceeding.
            55:32:49 P   Roger. Understand. Go ahead with your update.
            55:32:51 CC  Roger. Final: CSQ at 57:04:00; computer, PRELAUNCH.
                         46-1: T<sub>R</sub> and computer update. Did you
                         copy?
            55:33:17 P   Roger. Copied.
            55:33:23 P   CSQ: 57:04:00; computer, PRELAUNCH. 46-1: T<sub>R</sub>
                         and computer update.
            55:33:29 CC  That's affirmative.
            55:33:32 CC  We have nothing further for you at this time. We
                         show you as GO.
            55:33:35 P   Roger. And one question. Is this procedure prior
                         to loading the normal weights for the ATM - is it
                         about this START COMP business that we had the
                         other day?
	Page 275

       55:33:45 CC  That's correct.
       55:33:46 CC  That's affirmative.
       55:33:47 P   Okay. Thank you.
       55:34:41 P   CSQ, this is Gemini IX.
       55:34:44 CC  Go, Gemini IX.
       55:34:45 P   First, Step 1 - you want me to insert the numbers
                    in the IVI's when I go to CATCH-UP?
       55:34:53 CC  Stand by.
       55:35:09 CC  Roger. They want to insert the small numbers in
                    the IVI's to see if they will go to zero.
       55:35:14 P   Roger. They do go to zero. I understand you want
                    me to verify that they do not drive.
       55:35:20 CC  That's affirmative.
       55:35:22 P   Okay. We'll try it right there.
       55:35:27 CC  Stand by.

                          HAWAII

       55:46:55 CC  Gemini IX, Hawaii
       55:46:56 P   Go, Hawaii.
       55:46:57 CC  Roger. Has either of you started on the oral
                    temperature yet?
       55:47:02 P   That's affirm.
       55:47:03 CC  Roger. I have a little change to that ATM loading
                    procedure, if you'd like to copy it.
       55:47:11 P   Go ahead.
       55:47:12 CC  Okay. We'd just like for you to go to CATCH-UP on
                    the computer and then pick up the sequence you

	Page 276

                                         already have at Number 3.
                    55:47:23      P      Roger.  Understand.
                    55:49:01      CC     Gemini IX Pilot. We have a good temperature on
                                         you.
                    55:49:09      P      Gemini IX. Roger. And I'm - starting on Step 6
                                         of loading the ATM.
                    55:49:15      CC     Roger.  We've been following you down here.
                    55:49:20      CC     You're looking okay at this time.
                    55:49:22      P      Affirmative and everything GO and we'll get the
                                         rest of the crew status report as soon as the
                                         Pilot can talk.
                    55:49:28      P      Correction, Command Pilot.
                    55:49:29      CC     Roger.  Understand.
                    55:49:34      CC     Okay. We have a good temperature on the Command
                                         Pilot.
                    55:49:54      C      Hawaii, Gemini IX. A - water count now 2764 and
                                         we will continue drinking until we have 2847 on
                                         the gage.
                    55:50:05      CC     Roger.  You have 2764 at this time; you'll continue
                                         until 2847.
                    55:50:11      C      Roger.  That's to give us that 132 squirts into the
                                         water boiler.
                    55:50:13      CC     Roger.
                    55:50:17      CC     Have you both been drinking about the same or have
                                         you - or is one of you thirstier than the other?
                    55:50:22      C      Gene has had about three times as much of that
                                         since EVA.
                    55:50:28      CC     About three times as much since EVA?
	Page 277

       55:50:29 C    Roger.
       55:50:38 CC   Okay. Have you got any food to report?
       55:50:43 C    Yes. We've each had one meal today and we don't
                     know what to do with the second one.
       55:50:47 CC   Roger.
       55:51:02 CC   How do you feel today compared with yesterday,
                     when you started to delay the EVA until today -
                     as far as tiredness and physical feeling?
       55:51:11 C    Roger. We feel a lot - we feel about twice as
                     good. We both had to kind of - little drowsy
                     yesterday.
       55:51:20 CC   Roger. Understand.
       55:51:26 P    Hawaii, it appears that Module 4-Alpha is going

       55:52:15 P    Go, Hawaii.
       55:52:16 CC   Okay. I have a small Flight Plan update for you
                     if you're ready to copy.
       55:52:21 P    Go ahead.

       55:52:46 P    Roger. We got the Node: 55:18:51; Rev 35, 77 -

       55:52:56 CC   Roger. That's affirmative.

            56:20:57 CC   Gemini IX, RKV. Would you go to the EXPERIMENT
                          position and give us a readout on the Hydrogen
                          Peroxide Pressure and Temperature, please?

                     C    This is a continuation of the debriefing on the
                          Rendezvous. One trimming will complete the first
                          Rendezvous. Radar was turned on and lock was
                          obtained intermittently at 130 miles. It occurred
                          at 120 nautical miles. After N<sub>SR</sub> we started to
                          make data points throughout TPI. They showed
                          that we were fairly ... in our effort ... 12-1/2
                          miles.
                     P    The altitude -
                     P    Altitude ... shows us to be 12-1/2 miles. Our

	Page 279

                                      Delta, Delta-R held between 47 and 49, .49 negative,
                                      and this is based on a 50-nautical mile range. Just
                                      exactly a little over 2-1/2 miles difference, so
                                      we're probably 200 miles to the ATDA. Apparently
                                      so. We went into Rendezvous mode, as I recall
                                      from the charts.
                              C       And we noticed a computer problem prior to where
                                      the START COMP was initiated.
                              P       That was just on the last burn after the N<sub>SR</sub> burn 
                                      and ...
                              C       The computer was switched to Rendezvous mode.
                              P       After eight data points, we got a solution with the
                                      computer. Our first solution was expected - but
                                      then the computer also reacted just as if you had
                                      pushed START COMP, giving us an unauthorized solution.
                                      We re-initialized the computer and went
                                      into the Rendezvous mode. We went down through
                                      eight data points and picked up another solution,
                                      at which time the computer and the IVI's gave us
                                      a solution as did the MDIU and the computer. We
                                      had selected that as our Open Loop. This happened
                                      twice in a row.
                              P       The number of data points that was required to get
                                      a Closed Loop solution - and if we switched into
                                      the Closed Loop at 3:20:05 GET, we would get a
                                      solution that would - the computer would give us,
                                      if this START COMP cycle repeated itself, that
                                      solution would be our TPI Solution based upon -
                                      going into RENDEZVOUS. We caught this - we were
                                      in the process of talking about this when ...
                                      rendezvous 03:20:17 or 12 seconds late. We - what
                                      am I doing - Okay.
                              C       ...
                              P       The solution that the computer came up with turned
                                      out to come right down on the predicted time of
                                      Point Charlie or Point C, from the charts. However,
                                      this time was a little bit off. I am not sure how
                                      this time coincides with the back-up time for TPI
                                      burn, but the Closed Loop did come up just as predicted
                                      and with this automatic START COMP function
	Page 280

                        it had, the solution was apparently a good solution.
                        The time, as far as we are concerned for TPI, however,
                        differed with the ground. The computer gave
                        us 26 forward, 8 up and 4 right. It differed with
                        the ground. The ground gave us 26.7 forward, 1.3
                        up, 2.2 right. Backup correction, 24 forward and
                        0 up/down. We went with sort of a compromise because
                        we did not like the 8 up from the Closed
                        Loop at all and we did not have too much confidence
                        in the computer.
                    P   We went with 27 forward, 1 up and 2 right, which
                        was basically a compromise between the ground and
                        back-up solution. It looked good to us, which was
                        our on-board back-up. Now one thing about the on-board
                        and back-up rendezvous information. On both
                        this and the other rendezvous, many times we were
                        dependent on making corrections based on our radar
                        angle and then the elevation angle. Wherever we
                        could, we tried to take the two angles to get the
                        Delta-Delta-R difference of ..., so as a result,
                        we did compromise on this TPI and went with what
                        appeared to be the ground solution.
                    C   Okay. With respect to the lighting, approaching
                        TPI. We first saw a speck of light that could be
                        compared with about a fifth or sixth-magnitude
                        star and it was in excess of 50 miles. The ATDA
                        appeared in the darkness as about a zero-magnitude
                        star. Continuing on, we made our first back-up
                        solution measurement in 1 to 4 minutes after transfer
                        into reflected sunlight, and the ATDA disappeared
                        into darkness for approximately 5 minutes,
                        so the overall condition from the ground with respect
                        to the Phasing and the N<sub>SR</sub> was exactly on
                        time.
                    P   I might add that the Closed-Loop solution from the
                        computer came right on time. The COMP light came
                        right on the predicted time of my burn. In other
                        words, I predicted back-up burn time accurately
                        and my COMP light came on exactly on time. The
                        reason we did not like the 8 up on Closed-Loop
                        solution was that there was little or no ellipticity
                        and it just didn't appear right to us. As it turned
                        out, it was a good thing we did not burn it. The
                        first correction obviously was initiated as Closed-
	Page 281

                    Loop. We decided to see what the Closed-Loop
                    was going to give us on its first correction. It
                    came up with 2 aft and 3 up as my back-up solution.
                    We did get a Closed-Loop solution to go with it.
                    Closed-Loop solution was 2 aft, 2 up and 3 left.
                    My back-up solution said 3 aft and 4 up. They both
                    tended to agree. Whether or not there was a difference
                    in this optical sight angle, I don't know,
                    but for some reason we did go with the Closed-Loop.
                    It looked good to us. It even looked better to
                    us than the back-up solution. It looked pretty
                    poor to us on the basis of its own correction,
                    because we did not burn the 8 up in TPI. On the
                    third correction, which is back-up, I got 1 aft
                    and 1 up. We burned zero on the fourth correction.
                    Our insert correction gave 3 forward, 2 down;
                    back-up solution 0 forward and 3 down. We burned,
                    in Closed-Loop, 3 forward and 2 down. After that
                    point, the corrections, we felt, were very small
                    and the back-up solutions agreed with the Closed-
                    Loop. We went Closed-Loop and came right up the
                    pipe. We had very few LOS problems to control at
                    all. They were all within boundaries and we had
                    little or no braking problems at 1 mile. As I
                    recall, we took off about 20 - which brought us
                    down to somewhere around 20 feet a second and all
                    the COMP ... must have been ...
               C    Immediately after going into darkness we saw the
                    flashing light. The ATDA went into darkness at
                    approximately 20 miles ... we immediately saw a
                    flashing light. The flashing light stayed on for
                    15 seconds and disappeared. After this time, we
                    would intermittently see the flashing light. As
                    long as certainly 12 miles to 13 miles away, we
                    could see a slight red light when there was no
                    flashing and, as we progressed on, the ATDA finally
                    came in the vicinity of the moon. The maneuver
                    for the initial line of sight was held constant
                    and was done with the moon, before we made the
                    final correction to the right. The sky was lit up
                    so brightly by the full moon that very little ...
                    background could be seen. The ATDA from approximately
                    4 miles was in very brilliantly reflecting
                    moonlight. We could see the flashing light and
                    the RED, GREEN and AMBER lights at that time.
                    There was a final brake at approximately 1/2 mile.

	Page 282

                          We could tell that the cone lights were on and,
                          as we approached within 1000 feet, everything
                          looked in good shape on the ATDA since we could
                          see the cone lights and a part of the ATDA. Then,
                          as we closed in further, we could see the moonlight
                          and extensions on the nose of the ATDA. It became
                          very obvious, there in the moonlight, that the nose
                          shroud had not jettisoned. The shroud was open
                          like a set of jaws, approximately 30 degrees off,
                          not ... Braking went very smooth and we had 58
                          percent fuel remaining at the end of the first
                          run. Equal period orbit initiation at Omega 80
                          ... it was determined in real time that ... the
                          ATDA was going ... orbit rendezvous. At this time
                          we Alined the Platform ... made a good Platform
                          Alinement and proceeded directly on top of the
                          ATDA ... initial maneuver on time. As we fell
                          behind the ATDA, of course, we could see the running
                          lights, particularly the RED running lights
                          on the ATDA. Approximately 13 miles, pardon me,
                          up to approximately 8 miles in darkness ...
                      P   The sextant practice that was to occur after
                          separation, or 1 mile through 3 miles, was
                          attempted but could not be done for a couple of
                          reasons. At first we were at too steep an angle to
                          acquire the horizon out of the Spacecraft window
                          while we were boresighted on the target. In addition,
                          seeing a target that was as bright and
                          white as the ATDA was, it was impossible to see
                          the target against the ground background. We
                          discovered that it was very difficult during
                          Rendezvous even up to as close, as I recall, a
                          mile because we were coming in from above....
                          so, as a result, none of the sextant practice was
                          actually done because I could not acquire the
                          target visually at all. I did get a sextant reading
                          at 12 degrees to give us a back-up to our
                          Horizontal-Adjust Maneuver. Nominal was 41:05,
                          our time was 41:22. And then we got a GET of
                          local horizon crossing of 45:20 and 45:33 was
                          nominal. This gave us a Horizontal-Adjust maneuver
                          of .1-foot-per-second forward and .2-foot-per-second
                          out, which ended up in time to be 0 forward
                          and .5 foot-per-second up. I decided we would not
                          burn. Now, regarding Terminal-Phase Initiation,
                          we were coming in real well at - Tom.

	Page 283

               C    At this time we continued to track him on radar
                    throughout this maneuver ... The ATDA was only 8
                    to 9 miles in front of us. It was impossible to
                    see. We rolled to keep the sun from us. It became
                    brilliantly lit in sunlight and I would
                    estimate it was a maximum of about a zero-magnitude
                    star at dawn. He grew in intensity all the
                    way through the rest of the maneuver. It was very
                    easy to see, a short time after sunrise.
               P    I made a slight error at first. I took 47 degrees
                    for my second angle instead of 43 degrees. As a
                    result, I missed my whole transfer. I looked for
                    a second angle first and of course, I missed the
                    first angle. I was too late to go back. I didn't
                    think it was worthwhile waiting for a sextant angle,
                    then I regrouped and took the Delta-Theta that went
                    with it, because I thought the delay too long. So
                    what I did, I regrouped at that time and I took -
                    I computed TPI from Delta-Theta ... I could have
                    gotten a sextant reading of 8 degrees very easily.
                    We initiated ... TPI slightly late at 114.29 and
                    nominal is 112.51. We had to go with this method
                    and then, plotting ourselves on the chart, started
                    courses that seemed correct. Even though TPI was
                    late, I felt that we caught it pretty well. Now
                    the first correction, because TPI was late ... I
                    again lost the sextant correction - because we'd
                    gone past that sextant angle as a result of the
                    late TPI - so I computed it again with Delta-Theta,
                    from the ball and the time, and got 0 aft and 2
                    down. Now I was all prepared on the second correction.
                    I got my sextant angle, but the second sextant
                    angle was 80 degrees, and an 80 degree angle
                    is almost impossible to get in the Spacecraft.
                    Cramped far down in the left bottom corner of the
                    window, I was not able to pick the horizon out. I
                    feel that this correction went very good. I computed
                    it with a combination of sextant angles and
                    Delta-Theta and came up with the time and a Delta-
                    Theta, but the correction was slightly biased or
                    ended up to be a bad correction because of the
                    last sextant angle. Delta-Theta was good, but
                    the 80-degree sextant angle was bad. You just
                    didn't have enough room for error up here, whether
                    you held perpendicular to the horizon or not, and
                    I think this was the difficulty.

	Page 284

                    P    I came up with 2 down. I feel this correction
                         probably should have been 0 or close to it....
                         quite a bit of line-of-sight correction in the
                         mode prior to braking. Like to talk about the
                         lighting and braking, Tom?
                    C    Right. After TPI, the reflected sunlight continued
                         to increase to a more brilliant light than
                         the planets by the time that we were in ... 3
                         miles. There was no difficulty in seeing it. I
                         used the optical sight out of the window optically
                         for all the braking. At 1 mile the nose cone and
                         the complete body of the ATDA was the size of the
                         total of Agena. I tried braking at approximately
                         - well, I would estimate 3/4 of a mile - continued
                         in brake and arrived at stationkeeping position
                         well before sunset. We made the Rendezvous in the
                         inverted position. The terminal phase on up presented
                         no difficulty whatsoever.
                    P    I personally feel that the reason we were so -
                         could so ably see the target in reflected sunlight
                         was that big white nose cone. It was silver with
                         a dull burnished aluminum, was very dull and burnished
                         where that white should have shown out there.
                    C    On the Rendezvous from above, we continued it in
                         after the N<sub>SR</sub> maneuver.
                    P    Closed-Loop solutions for the total velocity ...
                         total velocity and we didn't get a repeat of
                         START COMP cycle and T<sub>I</sub> and V<sub>T</sub> looked real good.
                         Occasionally we'd get one about every fourth or
                         fifth solution that came up that would be higher
                         than the preceding one, but generally they came
                         down in a fairly systematic order. We had a lot
                         of faith in our Closed-Loop by the time it came.
                         However, we saw ... ellipticity for about - let
                         me see ... mile Delta-H. We were about 8 m1les
                         ... and then we were ... and then we were still
                         going. We were still going up when we hit TPI
                         and our computer gave out ... the pass over the
                         RKV. I'll repeat what I was going to say. We
                         noticed an ellipticity ... we were about 1/2 mile
                         over our desired 7-1/2 miles. We started out
                         about a 1/4 of a mile high and went up to 1/2
                         mile high. We then started coming back down and 

	Page 285

                    we went through 7-1/2 miles in Delta-Delta ...
                    all the way as high as ...
               CC   Ascension, AOS ...
               P    ... a 1/3 of a, 3/10 of a mile, 1/3 of a mile.
                    But we got the Closed-Loop ... properly. The
                    Closed-Loop gave us 19 forward and & down and
                    I'd like to point out ... 1/2 forward and 3/10 up.
                    ... in the Closed-Loop gave us 2 left. We didn't
                    like the down and at that time we left it ... to
                    the ground so there were two things about the
                    Closed-Loop we didn't like ... much more logical,
                    so we went with 17 forward and 3 up, essentially
                    the back-up solution for Terminal Phase Initiate.
                    The COMP light came ON at 7:50, time 7:50, and we
                    initiated a correction at 8 minutes. I predicted
                    it to come on at 7:50, so we're pretty close there.
                    Our first correction on back-up data was 0 forward
                    and 3 down.
               C    Alined the Platform.
               P    Then we Alined the Platform at that time. Closed-Loop
                    or Open-Loop back-up information ... the
                    Closed-Loop gave us 4 aft, 1 up and 5 left. We
                    burnt 4 aft, 1 up and 3 left. With the Closed-Loop,
                    the up looked good on the basis of our
                    initial transfer. Here again the computer - although
                    we did not - ... the first correction gave
                    us 1 up ... both the primary ... computer solutions
                    are debatable, I believe. Like to talk, too, about
                    our lighting, Tom.
               C    Now.
               C    Prior to transfer, we could see the - target flashing
                    light and, suddenly, just before daylight we
                    noticed a small light that grew in intensity. It
                    was the brightest reflecting target we have ever
                    seen. I would estimate that it was 4 to 5 times
                    brighter than Sirius, against the earth's surface
                    just before sunrise with reflected moonlight on it.
                    We had this at 20 miles. As sunrise occurred, the
                    lighting changed from moonlight into sunlight and
                    the intensity of the target decreased all the way
                    through. We finally came out over the desert areas,

	Page 286

                        where we lost the target completely.
                    P   This is where it became extremely difficult to
                        get good angles because we were going from boresight
                        to radar and radar to - hey, Tom, I don't
                        know exactly! they were not obviously really
                        steady and some of our corrections ... but as I
                        recall, we did not have visual contact until -
                        correction, we were doing line-of-sight control
                        and you were radar-boresighted and I think it was
                        to a mile before we had it.
                    C   During this time we had reflected sunlight from
                        the desert and I could not see my pattern on the
                        optical reticle. There was no possible way to see
                        the target. I tried to adjust the needles, which
                        had fluctuated in somewhat of a previously prescribed
                        manner. The Range-Rate needle was far in
                        excess of nominal and continually fluctuating between
                        12 to 15 feet per second. I finally could
                        see a faint speck in the distance, 3 to 3-1/2 miles.
                        This was not ... by reticle. Finally, as we crossed
                        the Red Sea, I could see you coming up on the white
                        target, against a blue ocean, but 1 mile was approximately
                        the maximum that we could see under this
                        condition. And during this time the radar needles
                        fluctuated back and forth ... We continued in to
                        one-half mile, we got a good Range-Rate and the
                        line-of-sight was going good ... Range-Rate to a
                        negative value.For this we had to make a 7 to 10-foot-per-second
                        positive forward thrust. At this
                        time we continued on until we were stationkeeping.
                    P   The third correction back-up gave 2 aft and 2 down
                        and then we could see rapidly that we were crossing
                        angles. The fourth correction gave Closed-Loop:
                        2 forward, 10 down and 7 right; 1 aft, 5 down, and
                        we burned. Apparently Tom could see errors developing,
                        as I recall, from the ball. We burned a total
                        of ... We went in on the basis of LOS at that point
                        and we had quite a bit of line-of-sight control,
                        which worked out fine. We had to force it down
                        because our angles were crossing too steeply ...
                        come up into the sun as I recall it was happening
                        at that time. I think the one thing we ought to
                        remember from this Rendezvous ... showed suddenly
                        during the equal-period orbit was that when you're

                    looking down at daylight with an earth background,
                    the target is almost impossible to see.
                C   Also, the motion that you experienced as you are
                    down to a vertical position going across the ground
                    is something phenomenal. The relative positions,
                    even when you can see plainly, are very hard to
                    ascertain; as is the job of looking at your Flight
                    Director Attitude Indicator, optically tracking and
                    also cross-checking your radar.
                P   As the target goes across the ground, it is impossible
                    to try to pinpoint it against any terrain,
                    looking down. It was just impossible to acquire
                    it even after we thought we would. We might add that
                    on our third day here today, we turned on our radar
                    and got a fairly steady lock-out up through about
                    179 miles, at which time we changed our attitudes
                    and did not follow it any further.

                     started and we'd like you to start with Section
                     2.
        57:56:19 CC  IX, RKV. We'd like to get an on-board reading of
                     the Hydrogen Peroxide Pressure and Temperature.
        57:56:28 C   Roger. Stand by.
        57:56:35 C   Hydrogen Peroxide Pressure is 48; Temperature,
                     64 degrees.
        57:56:42 CC  Roger. Copy 48 and 64 degrees.
        57:56:54 CC  Okay. We'd like to have you turn your Tape Recorder
                     Power circuit breaker to the OPEN position.
        57:57:02 C   OPEN.
        57:57:20 CC  And we'd like to get a feel from you, Gemini IX,
                     on that 132 counts of water. Did you drink any of
                     it? Do you have much feel for how much you drank
                     of it?
        57:57:31 C   Roger. We drank - out of 132, we drank a good 70
                     of it.
        57:57:36 CC  Roger. Copy 70.
        57:58:01 CC  IX, RKV. I'd like to know if that was equal
                     amount between the both of you or - -
        57:58:08 C   Roger. It's about equal between us.
        57:58:10 CC  - - Roger. Thank you.
        57:58:13 CC  Okay. As soon as we get these fuel cells purged
                     and get a Cryo Quantity readout, we'll put you to

             58:01:04  CC   Okay. We notice you're still on A pump in your
                            primary loop and the control valve temps are coming
                            on down just like you did last night. It might
                            get a bit cold in there in awhile.
             58:01:20  P    Right. We're going to B now.
             58:01:23  CC   Roger. We've got you.

             58:01:42  CC   Roger.
             58:01:52  CC   Okay, IX. You can move your switch back to the
                            OFF position.
             58:01:58  P    Roger. It's OFF.
             58:01:59  CC   Roger. We're all finished with you and you can
                            have a good night's sleep. We'll be watching
                            you here down on the ground.
             58:02:06  C    That's ...
             58:02:18  CC   We'll see you back at the ranch, IX. We won't see
                            you again tomorrow.
             58:02:23  C    Roger.

       58:02:26 P   Thanks for all the help.
       58:02:28 CC  Roger. It's been a pleasure.
       58:02:31 C   How have the seas been down there these times?
       58:02:34 CC  It's been nice and calm, a nice sunny day.
       58:02:40 CC  IX, Houston BLACK FLIGHT says they'll see you back
                    at Houston.
       58:23:10 P   This is the EVA debriefing for this afternoon. We
                    had about four hours for the EVA preparation, of
                    which we took less than three. We thought things
                    went very well during the EVA preparation; of
                    course, as usual we had the snake in the cabin, but
                    we sat here for approximately 45 minutes. We were
                    ready to go except for pilot pressurization, check
                    out emergency ELSS supply, 45 minutes before sunrise
                    and then 25 minutes before sunrise we went ahead and
                    did this. We egressed about 10 minutes before sunrise,
                    got the hatch fully open. The pilot was actually
                    standing in his seat in darkness - still we
                    got no sun coming over the horizon at all.
       58:24:10 C   This was approximately a GET of 49:16, 49 hours and
                    16 minutes.
       58:24:24 P   And the first thing we did - and the first thing I
                    did - I looked around, reached back and saw the
                    EV bar extended on the adapter section. I just
                    reached over and extended the bar on the retro section.
                    I'm sure glad it did because it came in handy
                    later.
       58:24:53 C   Experienced some difficulty on that.
       58:24:54 P   The EV camera bracket was very difficult to put in
                    the holder. As a matter of fact, I had to get two
                    hands on it at one time. Very, very difficult in
                    zero g. Then I put on the cutters - I wrapped them
                    around the - the IN hole that was out there. That
                    was again a little more difficult job than predicted,
                    because everything had to be one-handed, and some
                    time - because you have to hold on with the other
                    hand - because if you don't find some way to hold
                    on you are going to drift right out and do a somer-

	Page 294

                        sault right over on top of what you're doing. As
                        a matter of fact, I did it a number of times and
                        I'm pretty sure that that's what broke the D-14
                        antenna. I actually sat on it - laid on it with
                        my back but - got the cutters out there and got
                        those wrapped around - took the EV Hasselblad and
                        put it in on the chest pack, snapped it on. All
                        this went fairly smoothly, pretty much the way we
                        had planned it. We had the cameras positioned well
                        on top of the - Tom had it - or we got the umbilical
                        out at that time, and Tom, you had some comments on
                        that I guess you might want to read.
            58:26:09 C  Roger. On the umbilical, we had a number of difficulties.
                        Also, when you were standing on the
                        seat, you had some difficulty in maintaining position.
                        I had to help hold your feet down.
            58:26:27 C  When you're working near the Spacecraft, if you did
                        not have something directly to grab, your feet would
                        float up.
            58:26:41 P  Apparent through the whole EVA period was the fact
                        that whenever you float, you float up and if you
                        hold on to something, whether it be the docking
                        bar, handrail, or what it is, you do not have -
                        unless you've got two hands firmly implanted or a
                        foot or a hand or something - you do not have enough
                        strength in your wrist to overcome the inertia of
                        your body floating up. You just can't keep your
                        arms that rigid. And you can't get two hands on
                        it, generally, if it's the same thing like the
                        docking bar or one article because - it's not that
                        you can't reach - close your hands in front of you
                        - but when you're trying to hold on to something,
                        you need to do more than close your hand, you need
                        to grab it and strengthen - or straighten out your
                        wrist. The combination of the ELSS, plus the difficulty
                        in reaching, makes this impossible. I
                        think the main problem starts in the cockpit. The
                        fact that you start floating up all the time.
                        Whenever you're outside, it's always up, you never
                        float down. Even with a slight perturbation you
                        float for a little bit, and then you - you're on
                        your way up again, especially true Tom, on the
                        adapter work. The next thing was that he put the
                        docking mirror, he handed me the docking mirror,

	Page 295

                    and I put it on the docking bar. Of course, the
                    first thing is to get to the docking bar and I
                    tried to give myself a shove with my feet from the
                    hatch and also hold on to the RCS thrusters. Once
                    you get your hand in an RCS thruster, you can pull
                    yourself forward - it's pretty easy to hit the
                    docking bar but until - until you get yourself
                    alined fairly well with a thruster in a docking
                    bar position, you're just going to float up and
                    force yourself down. I got the mirror on and Tom
                    seemed to like that real well.
       58:28:39 C   Right. The mirror is a wonderful device for keeping
                    track of the person who's outside anytime he's
                    not in your field of view. I could see Gene right
                    when he was going back to the adapter, when he was
                    outside my field of view behind me here - out of
                    the field of view of my window.
       58:29:00 P   And then I - I pushed off, attempting to get in
                    position first to push off from the Spacecraft.
                    I found that holding the umbilical very short, so
                    you could position your feet somewhere on the
                    Spacecraft, and get yourself a fairly good thrust
                    action through the center of gravity. The only
                    problem is your feet do not stay on the Spacecraft
                    - you can't keep them on the Spacecraft. So I
                    pushed off a number of times and a couple of times
                    got out to the full extent of the umbilical and,
                    here again, you can talk about what is the best
                    way to pull in on an umbilical - jerk in or - a
                    slow pull. From my short experience today, I
                    feel that a slow pull is much, much better. But
                    - you can't - even a slow pull is very difficult
                    to direct to the center of gravity. So what happens,
                    even a slow pull will give your body rotation.
                    It's not the rotation that's so bad, but
                    it's the fact you you also pull yourself in towards
                    the Spacecraft, and the chance of your hitting the
                    Spacecraft with your back or your helmet or on the
                    side is very very good. Also, when I pulled in
                    again, I always floated to the top, never to the
                    bottom. Of course, this has something to do, I
                    feel, with the umbilical direction, but I think it
                    had more of a - more to do with the same general
                    tendency that we had here in the Spacecraft to
                    float up. Not truly being zero g. Tom, you watched
                   

	Page 296

                        some of this, didn't you?
            58:30:32 C  Right. Everytime you'd get out there and start to
                        maneuver, you always tended to go straight up -
                        float up.
           58:30:38 P   Again, I think this was not so much because of the
                        manner in which the umbilical was routed, but because
                        of the general tendency to go up. I can't
                        stress too much how difficult it is to hold on to
                        a single bar such as the docking bar and keep your
                        body rigid there partially in the attitude you so
                        desire, because it keeps you - all at once the
                        Spacecraft floats back up under you, and it takes
                        an awful strong wrist if one hand is to hold that
                        - to hold your whole body down and rigid, and two
                        hands to use ELSS, which is in front of you - it's
                        an almost impossible task. I had the Velcro pads
                        on my hands, and I got back to the right-hand side
                        of the Spacecraft. I started to use them and got
                        my left hand in. I started to put my right hand in
                        and I got it in there. But when I pulled my left
                        hand out, I pulled the Velcro pad right off my
                        hand. I didn't clench my fist apparently tight
                        enough to hold the Velcro pad to stay there and I
                        - my hand came right out. But another thing that's
                        very obvious, even with Velcro pads, if you try
                        to walk around the surface of the Spacecraft, it
                        would take a great deal of strength and wrist action
                        to keep your body stiff. I don't think you
                        would be able to develop this type of torque with
                        the Velcro pads, because again your feet will tend
                        to go right on over the top of you because you tend
                        to float up. If you, for instance, got on the starboard
                        side of the Spacecraft and kept your hands
                        in those Velcro pads, you'd probably do a complete
                        somersault and stand on your head and might be
                        laying on your back across the adapter - just because
                        of that tendency again to float up. I guess
                        after that I came back to the hatch. It was fairly
                        easy to work your way up to the hatch, step by step,
                        pulling slowly on the umbilical - just give a slow
                        jerk and then reach out and try to grab another
                        piece of the umbilical and make a sort of vectorial
                        correction to your direction of motion. A very
                        slow pull on a short umbilical and you can - you
                        can tend to control your attitude somewhat better

	Page 297

                                      and, of course, make corrections to your translations.
                                      I got back in the hatch and handed Tom
                                      the EV camera and he changed the lens and the film
                                      pack. I guess, Tom, without difficulty, because
                                      you sure handed it back in a hurry.
             58:33:09         C       Right. There was no difficulty at all, strapped
                                      in here.
             58:33:15         P       Then I put it back in and the camera again was
                                      very difficult to get back in the slot. But I
                                      did get it in and locked. Then I stepped out of
                                      the hatch. I had to get the umbilical clear, so
                                      I first held on to the short end of the umbilical
                                      - maybe about a foot from where it was attached
                                      to the hatch - and then attempted to close the
                                      hatch that way. It took quite a bit of effort and
                                      time to close the hatch because it was very stiff
                                      in the semi-open and fully-open modes. It was
                                      very loose in the last one - 8-10 inches of travel
                                      just before locking. But it took quite a bit of
                                      work. I got it partially closed and then, as I had
                                      planned earlier, I was going to work my way back
                                      to where I could hold on to the handrail on the
                                      retro adapter and close the hatch that way. I
                                      finally got it fully closed. Tom pulled a little
                                      bit from inside and I'm sure at the end much more.
                                      We finally got it shoved all the way closed and I
                                      was able to sort of control by body movements -
                                      one hand being on the hatch, rigid as well as pushing
                                      on it, and the other hand being on the arm rail.
                                      Then we got the hatch closed, and I began to work
                                      my way back to the back of the adapter. While I
                                      was still in the retro area, Tom cut off the thrusters
                                      and I told him to blow the EVA bars and he
                                      did; he said he did, and immediately I knew that
                                      we had problems there because I did not see the
                                      umbilical guide come around the adapter.     So I
                                      continued to work my way back there and, had I
                                      been able to hold myself rigid enough back there,
                                      I would have taken a picture, but the only thing
                                      to hold on to was the adapter handrail and that
                                      meant holding on out to my left and looking around
                                      a fairly jagged, but a very clean, adapter separation
                                      plane. So I didn't get a picture. I could
                                      see that the foot rail was deployed, the handrail
                                      on the far side was deployed - which would be the
	Page 298

                        bottom of the Spacecraft. The handrail and the
                        umbilical guide on my side, or on the top of the
                        Spacecraft, were not deployed and the bathtub was
                        hung up. I worked myself back around to where I
                        could - I was about a third of the way into the
                        adapter - and I just took a slight jolt or tug.
                        I pulled on the handrail, and it broke the bathtub
                        loose. It went sailing back - I gave a fair Delta-P,
                        I guess - and the umbilical guard extended very
                        slowly, as expected. It didn't give me any problems
                        at all. Had I anticipated any when I looked back
                        there, I wouldn't have gone in to do it, but I
                        could see fairly well what the problem was and I
                        knew the handrails extended very slowly. Had it
                        been the foot rail, I would have given it a second
                        thought. But then I threaded the umbilical through
                        the guide - pulled it - and looked over the top of
                        the Spacecraft to see that it was taut. It looked
                        very taut to me and out of the way of all thrusters.
                        However, when I began to put it in the umbilical
                        guard on the handrail, I was about a foot from
                        the mark that we had placed on this umbilical, so
                        I began to wonder. I did work my way back to take
                        another look at it on the adapter, pulled it tight,
                        and it looked good to me, so I worked my way back
                        into the adapter again. Now, here again it's very
                        difficult to do things one-handed because of the
                        strong wrist required. There's always a tendency
                        to float up. If you hold on with one hand, your
                        feet are going to come right on over the top of
                        you. The stirrups are undoubtly the greatest
                        thing that's happened, but even they, I think,
                        should be configured somewhat, because it's pretty
                        much of a very difficult task to don the AMU or
                        probably any other vehicle in the adapter area.
           58:37:25 P   I feel that without stirrups at all, just relying
                        on something like Velcro or to hold one foot under
                        the handrail - or one hand under the foot rail and
                        one foot on top - would have been impossible because
                        in donning the AMU, you have to have both
                        hands free almost all the time. This requires you
                        to be able to stay in the foot rail. It's a little
                        bit different in 1 g. In 1 g you could put your
                        feet in those rails, lean over and down to the
                        fringe where the tether was, make all your tether
                        hookings, tie into the extension without any problems

                                        at all. Here today, every time I would bend
                                        down there, I would float out. Then if I stiffened
                                        my ankles real tight and bent down there, it was
                                        an extremely difficult work load. I got the tether
                                        rig tied to my jumper with ease. Started out on a
                                        small tether hook, which I could do in 1 g with
                                        no problem at all, pressurized. But I had a great
                                        deal of difficulty with it today. I tried the large
                                        hook. I had a great deal of difficulty with it
                                        also, mainly because I needed two hands and I
                                        couldn't rely on two hands all the time. I couldn't
                                        rely on my feet to keep me in the stirrups and I
                                        couldn't rely on two hands to utilize in mating
                                        these hooks. I had to use one hand sometime to hold
                                        on with and force myself down in the stirrups. I
                                        finally got the large tether hook mated and I spent
                                        so much time on the other one that I decided that I
                                        was good for 125 feet of tether and I'd only go out
                                        so far on the first 25 feet. So I was tethered
                                        good, anyway, from the umbilical - from myself
                                        through the umbilical to the 125 feet. Tom, I
                                        think you turned these lights on about this time.
               58:39:14         C       Right.
               58:39:15         P       No, a little bit before that you turned them on
                                        because to get at the tether portside I had to
                                        take out the pen light.
               58:39:24         C       Right. Did you float out of the stirrups at any
                                        time? Did you float out of the stirrups one time
                                        or a couple times?
               58:39:30         P       I floated out of the stirrups continually - and
                                        that was one of my - that's why it took so much
                                        time.   I'd say wait until I get in position again
                                        because it was a two-footed and a one-handed task
                                        to stay in the stirrups. Again it was just a problem
                                        of floating up. But again the adapter didn't
                                        have anything hanging from it at all, just a pure,
                                        clean separation, Tom. Nothing back there at all.
                                        It was sharp in placed because I could see that
                                        fairly well. Let's see. We went though the
                                        checkoff list normally. Oh, the lights. We had
                                        the light - as I was facing the AMU - the light
                                        on the right worked, the one on the left did not.
                                        I had one good pen light so I put it on the left.
	Page 300

                                      I figured this would give me ample light, because
                                      I need most of the light on the left-hand side
                                      anyway to make my connection. We went through
                                      the normal donning of the AMU much more slowly -
                                      because of holding myself in position and - than
                                      we'd otherwise have to do. We can bend over to
                                      make and break these connections from the AMU.
                                      1 g pressurized is about 50% easier than 0 g.
                                      But I got all the AMU connections loose and fastened
                                      to the arm rails, went ahead and got the arm
                                      rails down.  Here again, retro were pyro-tested
                                      within 1 g pressurized; even in the zero g airplane
                                      pressurized, it is for some reason easier than this
                                      was. This was a very, very tough, two-handed operation.
                                      The point being, if I could get two hands
                                      on it the way I wanted to, it would be all right,
                                      but to get my body up where I could get two hands
                                      on it and reach around the bulky ELSS, my feet
                                      would come right out of the stirrups. I couldn't
                                      keep them in there at all, and this was a problem,
                                      Tom. Finally, got them both down. By that time
                                      I was probably a little bit bushed, but got them
                                      both down and got the bat wings installed. I even
                                      put the - the thermal - these little thermal tabs
                                      we had on there, and later on I noticed there was
                                      only one on there.  I noticed also, when we got in
                                      with the ELSS, but I definitely did put both of
                                      them on there. I guess one had floated away. Maybe
                                      I just picked it up again when I leaned over to
                                      do something.  We went through the procedures of
                                      checking out the nitrogen pressure and the oxygen
                                      and so forth and I swore here again I have never
                                      seen an oxygen valve that was as tight as this.
                 58:42:32      C      I heard - I heard you say that.
                 58:42:33      P      Never at anytime.
                 58:42:34      C      I think actually it was probably frozen.
                 58:42:36      P      I felt for sure that the oxygen valve was frozen.
                                      I finally got to it and I finally was able - or I
                                      got to it all right - and I had no problem because
                                      it was one-handed.  I held on with the other hand
                                      and had both feet in the stirrups in this case,
                                      because I was able to keep them there with my right
                                      hand.  Opening that thing with the left hand was the
	Page 301

                    highest - was one of the highest valve forces
                    I've ever felt on an AMU. I got it open, checked
                    the pressures, and the nitrogen pressure looked
                    like it was about 3000 and - I knew it was up there
                    - I couldn't see exactly because of the size of the
                    gage. The nitrogen pressure - or oxygen pressure
                    I could read upwards about 7000. So it looked
                    good to me. We turned on the power switch and I
                    got the light and I turned around and backed in.
                    Now backing in, I must say - and I figured it
                    would be, was an easier job in zero g than it was
                    in 1 g because I was able to - I was much lighter
                    and was able to sort of give myself a little
                    twist and twist myself right around. I came in
                    low and out of the way of the thruster extensions
                    on the AMU and got back in the AMU and sat down.
                    Prior to doing this, the sun was going down while
                    I still had my back to the west. The sun was going
                    down and I was going through - it took me a
                    long time to work on these arms and get the AMU
                    prepared to turn around and doff. The sun was
                    just almost unbearably hot on my back from about
                    the thigh on up to the small of my back. It just
                    felt like I was sitting on a hot stove. I just
                    had to - I - I was fine up until that point on
                    medium flow - I had to go to high flow on the
                    ELSS and I just had to wait there because even
                    my hands, holding on to these handrails, I could
                    feel in my fingertips how hot my hands were. It
                    was just phenomenal - I couldn't believe things
                    would be that hot. I just had to wait until things
                    cooled off. Then about the time the sun went down,
                    my visor started fogging and it started fogging
                    slowly and I continued on, turned around, got in
                    the AMU and then things started fogging up quite
                    a bit. I got the tether positioned - out of the
                    bag - positioned out of the way on the handrail
                    where I wanted it, which looked pretty good, although
                    floating at 0 g there's more umbilical and
                    tether lines floating around than you'll ever
                    believe. But you could keep track of them and
                    keep them untangled. We then broke the electrical
                    connection that went on the AMU - the AMU electrical
                    connection - and I verified VOX that we had a COM
                    check. Tom, you want to comment on that?
       58:45:27 C   The COM check. When Gene would transmit the first

	Page 302

                                      part of his word - say the first word, or the first
                                      part of his first word would come in very clear,
                                      followed by a series of warbles all the rest of
                                      the way through. Sometimes it was running like
                                      the two  words through a series of warbles.   In
                                      these warbles he was practically unreadable. To
                                      me it presented a very marginal case as far as
                                      communications. If everything else had gone all
                                      right, I would have said GO when the AMU - with
                                      this type of communications.
                  58:45:58      P     I felt the communications were marginal too. The
                                      VOX was much more sensitive than I've ever - ever
                                      heard it for some reason.  I pushed - I think I
                                      solved the problem - I pushed the mike as far
                                      away with my lips and tongue as I could get them
                                      from my mouth, and that seemed to solve the VOX
                                      problem.  However, when Tom would talk, he'd be
                                      fairly clear but I could tell that I obviously
                                      lost, I don't know, at least 10 or 15 to 20 percent
                                      of his conversation. There was also a lot of
                                      background noise, and I brought up the left-hand
                                      rail and I tried to pull the talk mode.  I had
                                      the same results, so I knew it wasn't just VOX.
                                      It was just the general communications. They were
                                      acceptable, but not nearly as good as I had hoped
                                      they would be or as good as they checked out on
                                      the ground. About this time, my visor was really
                                      fogging up and I looked at my pressure gage. It
                                      was fogging up as a matter of fact, right now
                                      it's - I don't know how many hours later - 8 hours
                                      later - and there's - it's still solid water.
                  58:47:02      C     Nearly 10 hours later. And you still can't read
                                      it, can you?
                  58:47:05      P     Slowly, cross - slowly - no I can't read it -
                                      slowly around the edges, it's good for 30 minutes,
                                      but it's just solid with water. That's the way
                                      my visor was.  It just got - it got just completely
                                      fogged up and I could just about see that there
                                      was light glowing out there, and that's about it.
                                      That's why I tried to use the mirror to see things,
                                      and couldn't see through them at all because I
                                      couldn't see. I could feel, though, that my right
                                      controller - my attitude controller was not. I
                                      don't know why because this had happened the last
	Page 303

           58:50:08 P   I actually - when we decided to come out of the
                        adapter and give up on the AMU, I made sure all
                        my connections were undone and I jettisoned the
                        tether to make sure that got out of the way.
                        Came back without much difficulty. I came back,
                        actually, with the sun visor up. I did not have
                        it down - it was daylight - I did not have it
                        down. I worked my way around the adapter over
                        the handrail.
           58:50:41 C   Please keep your feet up.
           58:50:45 P   Well, I could just begin to see now, through
                        around a spot around my nose. The trouble is
                        that spot stayed there --
           58:50:51 C   That's right, you had a spot around your nose
                        where you could see.
           58:50:52 P   - - Around the center of the plate. The whole
                        side here was fogged up and the whole side over
                        here was fogged up. And I came around on the
                        handrails and worked my way into the seat area
                        and stood there for awhile because, admittedly,
                        I was probably pretty tired by this time, and
                        wanted to see what that visor would do. I put
                        my sun visor down at this time because there
                        didn't seem to be much appreciable change in the
                        visor. It was daylight, so I thought it advisable
                        to go ahead and put it down. I waited there for
                        awhile and it slowly started to clear, but it
                        would have been an hour in the sun before the
                        water cleared out of it and, as I say, even here
                        my pressure gage is still - still full of water.
                        I couldn't read my pressure gage out there, even
                        when I could see through my visor. We covered
                        the EV camera and I handed the Hasselblad to Tom.
                        I stayed out there for awhile and contemplated
                        whether we should wait for darkness for S-1 or
                        not. We decided we'd go ahead and try to get
                        in. We gathered up the umbilical and worked my
                        way in.
           58:52:07 C   The Egress Maneuver proved every bit as difficult
                        as what we anticipated, with respect to complexity
                        of gear to be handled. We'd gone though it many
                        times so we were prepared for it, but it was still
	Page 304

                    a long tedious process. The hatch was also hard
                    to open to the extent of the ... egress. Also
                    hard to close for the first part of the stroke.
       58:52:31 P   I think the hatch made it difficult for me to
                    egress because I'd get personally in and then I'd
                    try to pull the hatch and it was extremely stiff.
                    When it was open 20 or 30 degrees - extremely
                    stiff, and I had to get partially out to bring it
                    in, and then try to go through my egress again
                    and this was difficult. I knew I wasn't all the
                    way down in with my knees when I leaned back, but
                    we had the hatch coming, so I just pushed down
                    with all I had from my arms and, believe it or
                    not, Tom was able to - the last - 6 or 8 or 10
                    inches in fast travel was very easy. Tom was
                    able to get a good inertia on it and we locked
                    it the first time. The trouble is - one thing
                    I was trying to get clear from the hatch area,
                    Tom, was the oxygen lines and my tiedown cord,
                    and there was a line from the umbilical guard
                    that was floating around, and I didn't want to
                    get anything caught in the hatch seal. There
                    were a number of things that were floating out in
                    that area. I think just - I know there's many
                    more things I'm going to remember - but some
                    things that are probably worth mentioning. I
                    feel that all our egress work in the zero-g airplane
                    is well and good, but it ought to be done
                    after we're good and tired. The umbilical: I've
                    got a note here on umbilical or egress, and I
                    don't remember exactly what it was but it will
                    come back to me I'm sure. The body inertia out
                    there, again is a big thing; that - your tendency
                    to float up - tendency not to be able to stabilize
                    yourself with one hand by holding on to anything.
                    Unless you've got extremely strong wrists, I think
                    this is almost impossible for the average person
                    to do and the ELSS prevents you from holding on to
                    the same point or the same bar with both hands.
                    If you can't get close enough to it, such as the
                    docking bar, which is away behind the nose, or
                    there's some obvious reason that you can't get
                    close enough to hold on to anything unless it's
                    right in front of the ELSS - you have to reach
                    for a little bit. I think the S-1, after my experience
                    with working - standing - in the cockpit
	Page 305

                        and working in the cockpit - it's well and easy
                        to say just go ahead and lean on the hatch or lean
                        on the adapter and take a picture. If you just
                        even stand in the hatch or the hatch area or the
                        seat, Command Pilot Tom had to either hold my feet
                        down or had to lock them under something. You're
                        always floating in one direction or another, and
                        to take S-1 pictures for 30-second exposure
                        times I feel would have been impossible, and I
                        don't feel we lost a thing. I hope possibly we
                        gained something by taking the pictures from inside
                        the Spacecraft.
           58:55:23 C   Also, every slight motion he made, even standing
                        up, would fire the thrusters. We were in Plat
                        mode. One example, when you went to the adapter
                        and I turned off the control power for approximately
                        30 seconds, at the end of this time we were yawed
                        over 100 degrees and pitched down 30 degrees - -
           58:55:50 P   I couldn't tell - I was so busy wrapped up in
                        everything else - -
           58:55:52 C   - - Just for the torques you generated. I think
                        that for the rest of the Gemini program, the ideal
                        way is the way we did it. Use the Plat mode and
                        Automatic Rate Stabilize Reference mode, because
                        when Gene was working in the adapter, tugging on
                        those arms, the Plat mode was firing continuously
                        back there. The disturbing torques displaced on
                        the Spacecraft were very difficult to overcome
                        in Pulse mode. It would take a Direct mode in
                        RATE COMMAND.
           58:56:22 P   I feel that procedures in our planning were well
                        thought out. I think they would have sufficed,
                        but there were a number of unknown terms of operating
                        back in the adapter section. Our experience
                        thus far in EVA is to just let us work out in
                        front of the Spacecraft a little bit - a little
                        umbilical work but - we just - we just - never
                        have done - never have done any long-term tasks
                        such as working in the adapter. And you've got
                        to fix yourself, fix your position back there or
                        it's just such a workload - and such a task that
                        it's almost unbelievable. I don't feel all was
                        lost; as a matter of fact, I feel a great deal was
	Page 306

                    gained. I feel that I was able to accomplish a
                    great deal of work back there and look situations
                    over and see what was happening, such as getting
                    rid of the bathtub and what-have-you and, as I
                    say, I think our procedures would have accomplished
                    what we set out to do, but we obviously overlooked
                    a number of very small things, one of which is the
                    restriction that ELSS does give you when you want
                    to reach out in front of you and you have to have
                    two hands. I also - I will say that I don't feel
                    that a large hook for anything is adequate. I
                    think we ought to build one larger and make things
                    easy - and not make things adequate for EVA anymore,
                    but make them easy for EVA, which means
                    going to the extreme of our logical thinking for
                    normal 1 g flying. I know this is true, now.
                    Okay, Tom, you might mention something about
                    opening the left hatch with all the stuff you
                    have in your - -
       58:58:02 C   Right. With all the gear I had in my footwell,
                    umbilical bag, which was later out, the S-10, and
                    the other gear that I had stowed in the footwell,
                    I think it would have been nearly an impossible
                    task for me to open the hatch and do the egress
                    after that. I could have opened the hatch, but
                    I think there was a very low probability that I
                    ever would have been able to get my hatch closed.
                    So I - opening the Command Pilot's hatch during
                    the Gemini program, I think is a last ditch resort
                    and should be considered very carefully before it
                    is ever attempted.
       58:58:47 P   - - It is difficult for me to say whether we -
                    how the water in the ELSS went - it did get hot
                    toward the end - a little warm. I don't necessarily
                    attribute it to ELSS, I attribute it to
                    the - maybe to my workload, but I think it performed
                    very well. I was doing fine on medium
                    flow until I got that sun on my back and that was
                    just - that was just unbelievably hot. Maybe I
                    was in the focal point of the gold curtain back
                    there; I don't know, but most of the heat was
                    focused on my back and the back of my legs, not
                    on the front, and it was unbearably hot. High
                    flow didn't put a dent in it, and I think this is
                    what started everything to fog up. The best way
	Page 307

                        obviously to do it is out-of-plane so you don't
                        have that sun on your back, but then I'm sure
                        there are going to be some stationkeeping problems
                        with other vehicles, at which time I know
                        we'll have a lot to elaborate on later, probably.
                        But I don't know. If we ever work in the adapter
                        again, we're certainly going to have to consider
                        that sun going down.
           58:59:51 C   Right.
           58:59:56 P   I failed to mention that during egress we did lose
                        one roll of film. We don't know which one it was
                        - exposed - unexposed - but we did lose one.

       66:44:34 C   Go ahead with your update, Carnarvon.
       66:44:35 CC  Roger. Item 1 is a node: Time, 68:47:45;
                    Remarks, Rev 43, 130 degrees west; right
                    ascension, 18 hours 44 minutes. Second
                    item, final Canary Islands: Time, 67:37:40;
                    Remarks, crew status report; then begin stowing
                    equipment.
       66:45:39 CC  Gemini IX, Carnarvon CAP COM.
       66:45:42 P   Go ahead, Carnarvon. Fuel cell purge is complete.
                    Those the only two items?
       66:45:46 CC  Roger. Will you put your Cryo Quantity Read
                    switch to ECS O<sub>2</sub>?
       66:45:54 P   Roger. ECS O<sub>2</sub>.
       66:46:04 P   Okay. FUEL CELL O<sub>2</sub>.
       66:46:16 CC  Gemini IX, Carnarvon. Will you switch to FUEL
                    CELL O<sub>2</sub>?
       66:46:21 P   FUEL CELL O<sub>2</sub>.

           67:25:13 CC  Gemini IX, this is Houston.
           67:25:15 C   Good morning, Houston. Gemini IX.
           67:25:19 CC  Roger. How's everything going up there?
           67:25:22 C   Roger. Pretty good. We've got the Platform
                        Alined 0, 0, 0 degrees, and computer should
                        go in on a different update mode. Our stowage
                        is pretty well squared away.
           67:25:34 CC  Okay. We have a message for you on the computer
                        problem that we had the other day. You'll have
                        to START COMP. When you get to switching into
                        REENTRY, the computer running light comes on.
                        An alternate procedure is to switch out of REENTRY
                        to a spare position, which is one detent
                        clockwise of REENTRY, and then switch back to
                        REENTRY 1 second prior to retrofire.
           67:26:13 C   Okay. We've just gone to REENTRY on the computer
                        and the light does not come on.
           67:26:17 CC  Okay. Good.
           67:26:35 CC  Gemini IX, Houston.
           67:26:37 C   GO, Houston.
           67:26:38 CC  Roger. I've got some ball scores here if you're
                        interested.
           67:26:42 C   Okay. Let's hear them, Buzz.
           67:26:44 CC  Roger. Which ones are you interested in? I've
                        got the whole "smear" here.
           67:26:47 C   Let's try the Astros and the Cubs.
           67:26:53 CC  Okay. Pittsburgh 10, the Astros 5.
	Page 310

       67:27:01 C    You struck out. Try again.
       67:27:05 CC   Well, if I can read this message, it looks like
                     the Reds 5 - the Reds 8 and the Cubs 3.
       67:27:12 C    Yes, you ought to go back to sweeping the streets;
                     you struck out again.
       67:27:16 CC   Doesn't sound very good, right? Okay. We had a
                     tornado in Enid, Oklahoma. How's that one?
       67:27:24 C    In Enid?
       67:27:25 CC   Yes.
       67:27:27 C    How's the weather in Houston?
       67:27:30 CC   Looked pretty good when I came in.
       67:27:33 C    Pretty dark out, right?
       67:27:39 CC   Can you see anything of a tropical storm about,
                     oh, a little bit behind you right now. There is
                     supposed to be a storm building south of Cuba
                     called - it'll be called Alma, if it reaches that
                     strength.
       67:27:56 C    We're in darkness right now, Buzz. Can you give
                     us a latitude and longitude on it?
       67:28:21 CC   How about 85 degrees west and about 18 degrees
                     north?
       67:28:27 C    85 and 18. Okay.
       67:28:22 P    Looks like we pass just about over it next time
                    around.
       67:28:36 CC  On the Cubs, Gene - had a double header. The
                    first one was Reds 8, and the Cubs 3, and the
                    second one, Cubs won 9 - 5.
       67:28:46 P   Yippee!
       67:28:54 P   Out of two teams, I haven't gotten many wins this
                    week.
	Page 311

           67:29:22  CC  Say again?
           67:29:27  P   I said out of two teams, I don't have many wins
                         this week.
           67:29:54  P   Is poor Ed going out pulling his hair out after
                         yesterday?
           67:30:03  CC  Gemini IX, Houston. I didn't read your last
                         transmission. Could you give us a Propellant
                         Quantity, please?
           67:30:09  C   Roger. We're reading zero on the gage, but we
                         still haven't had a drop on our fuel regulated
                         pressure, so we're not on the Volkswagen tank yet.
           67:30:20  CC  Okay. I understand. What's that pressure showing
                         now?
           67:30:24  C   Say again?
           67:30:25  CC  What is the pressure showing now?
           67:30:27  C   Roger. 305.
           67:30:29  CC  Good enough. Ready to get a vector to go get
                         the ATDA?
           67:30:36  C   Say again. We've got a little bit of fuel left;
                         we might try to work in a fourth one.
           67:30:44  CC  Might as well.
           67:30:57  C   We had good solid lock on the radar yesterday.
                         170 miles on it.
           67:31:03  CC  Yes. That was real good.
            67:31:14 CC  Gemini IX, Houston.
            67:31:16  C  Go ahead.
            67:31:18 CC  What sort of reading are you getting now on
                         your Cabin Pressure?
            67:31:22 C   Roger. We're about 4.8.

	Page 312

         67:31:24  CC   Roger. That's quite close to what we've got
                        here.
         67:31:28  C    It has been holding about 4.9 to 4.8 all night
                        long.
         67:31:31  CC   Okay. Very good.
         67:32:00  CC   Gemini IX, Houston.
         67:32:02  P    Go ahead, Houston.
         67:32:03  CC   Roger, Gene. Chris is wondering when he ought
                        to get the cigars out to light up, once you hit
                        the water.
         67:32:12  P    When he sees our smiling face on the carrier,
                        and I'll buy.
         67:32:16  CC   You'll buy, is that right?
         67:32:27  C    Tell Chris that I might even break training
                        after splashdown and smoke one, too.
         67:32:36  CC   I'm not sure I read that right.
         67:32:39  C    You did.
         67:32:41  CC   Okay. We'll be seeing you, oh, perhaps later
                        on this afternoon.
        67:32:45   P    Roger.
        67:33:41   CC   Gemini IX, Houston.
        67:33:43   C    Go ahead, Houston. With you.
        67:33:45  CC    Roger. I'd like to remind you of a crew status
                        report over Canaries and put the temperature
                        probes in at, oh, about 1 minute. We've got 1
                        minute to LOS.
        67:33:56  C     Roger.

            67:38:11  CC   Gemini IX, Canary CAP COM. We have a valid oral
                           temp. We're standing by for your third water
                           report.
            67:38:19  C    Roger. The water gun now reads 2925 and both crew
                           members have had two meals since yesterday evening.
            67:38:33  C    It looks like it's nice and sunny out in the
                           Canaries today.
            67:38:36  CC   Yes. It's a lovely day outside here.
            67:38:39  C    I'm going to snap a couple of pictures.
            67:39:19  CC   Gemini IX, Canaries. Could you give us a sleep
                           report also?
            67:39:23  C    Roger. Pilot had 5 hours sleep, Command Pilot had
                           6 hours.
            67:39:31  CC   Roger. Copy.
            67:39:37  CC   You're looking real good on the ground here,
                           Gemini IX. We'll be standing by.
            67:39:41  C    Roger. We're powered up to Platform ... We're
                           going to take some pictures on this pass and then
                           finish the stowage.
            67:39:46  CC   Okay. Very good.
            67:40:23  P    Canaries, IX. Which island is the tracking site
                           on?
            67:40:28  CC   It's on the Grand Canary Island.
            67:40:31 P     Is that the big one in the middle?
            67:40:33  CC   Right, that's the big one. Way down at the south
                           end.
            67:40:39  P    Got any trees down there?
            67:40:43 CC    Just a few right on the end.

       68:13:42 P   Go ahead, Carnarvon.
       68:13:43 CC  Roger. We don't have anything for you. If you
                    need anything, give us a call.
       68:13:48 P   Will do. Thank you, Bill.

       68:55:16 CC  Gemini IX, Houston.
       68:55:20 C   Houston, Gemini IX.
       68:55:22 CC  Good morning, Tom. We're standing by.
       68:55:24 C   Roger. In our Pre-Retro Check during stowage, as
                    I was checking through the cockpit, I knocked off
                    one of the Electronic Timer circuit breakers for
                    about 1 second and got it back on. Checked; all
                    the clocks run the same as the electric clock does.
       68:55:46 CC  Okay. We're not reading you too well. Wait till
                    we get a little more elevation here.
       68:55:48 C   Okay.

                          TEXAS

       68:56:28 CC  IX, Houston. You say you find your Electronic
                    Timer circuit breaker knocked off for a little bit
                    and it's reset.
       68:56:35 C   Roger. I caught it when I knocked it off and got
                    it right back on. Probably a second or so off.
                    We'll have to recheck all the clocks for sync.
       68:56:45 CC  We'll have to update that thing anyway.

	Page 315

           68:56:47 C   Yes. Okay.
           69:03:33 C   Houston, Gemini IX.
           69:03:36 CC  Go ahead, IX.
           69:03:37 C   Roger. We should be approaching that tropical
                        storm about now. We'll pitch down and see if we
                        can take a look at it.
           69:03:42 CC  Okay. That's the one in your landing area.
           69:03:49 C   That's just about in the landing area. Right?
           69:04:01 CC  Roger. We have you approaching 250 on your VW
                        tank. When you get to that value you might arm it.
           69:04:10 C   Roger.
           69:07:13 C   Houston, Gemini IX. We're arming the Volkswagen
                        tank at this time.
           69:07:17 CC  Okay, Tom.
           69:07:24 C   And it works good.
           69:07:27 CC  Yes, we have it. Pressure coming up.
           69:08:53 CC  Houston is about 1 minute from LOS at Bermuda.
           69:08:57 C   Roger.

                              CANARY ISLANDS

           69:15:34 CC  Gemini IX, Canary CAP COM. You're looking good on
                        the ground. We're standing by.
            69:15:38 C  Roger. Canary. We're just taking a few pictures
                        here.
            69:15:42 CC Roger.

        69:24:13  C    Roger, Houston. Loud and clear.
        69:24:15  CC   You're the same.
        69:24:17  C    Houston, Gemini IX. Would you relay the word to
                       Captain Hartley to have the big ship right on the
                       landing point?
        69:24:24  CC   You bet we will!
        69:24:25  C    Okay.
        69:24:27  CC   Tom, your IVI versus bank angle chart is satisfactory
                       for this orbit.
        69:24:36  C    Roger.

         69:48:52 C    Go ahead, Carnarvon.
         69:48:53 CC   I've got some reentry information for you when
                       you're ready to copy.
         69:48:57 C    Roger. You're coming in very weak. Go ahead.
         69:49:00 CC   I say we have some reentry information for you when
                       you're ready to copy.
         69:49:04  C   Ready to copy.
         69:49:07  CC  Okay. This is the 46-1: your nominal IVI's are
                       aft 298 and down 112; bank angle additional deflection
                       at 0 is 189; 55 is plus 45, and 90 is 75;
                       pitch gimbal at 400K 90. You won't have a lighted
                       horizon at Retro, but you will at 400K. Begin
                       blackout at 22 plus 08; end blackout at 20 plus 75;
                       RET of drogue, 28 plus 47; RET main, 30 plus 21.
                       Use your back-up curves for bank angle 146 degrees.
         69:50:33  P   Carnarvon. 46-1: understand IVI's are 298 and
	Page 317

                        112: downrange needle deflection zero degrees is
                        plus 189; the 55 degrees is 45; 90 degrees is 75.
           69:50:53 CC  That's minus 75.
           69:50:54 P   Minus 75. Roger. And pitch gimbal is 400K, 90

       70:30:38 CC  That's correct.
       70:30:42 C   Do we have a loaded computer at this time?
       70:30:51 CC  Negative. Your computer is not loaded yet.
       70:30:53 C   Okay.
       70:30:55 CC  Okay. That bank right was 60 degrees; bank left
                    50; bank right 60.
       70:31:01 C   Bank right 60.
       70:31:06 CC  Okay. We're ready to transmit the load now.
       70:31:09 CC  You all set?
       70:31:10 C   We're all set.
       70:31:14 CC  Okay. Transmitting now.
       70:31:40 CC  Did you get a light on that, Gene?
       70:31:43 P   This time I received it.
       70:31:46 CC  Okay. We're ready at Arm RCS when you're ready.
       70:31:52 C   Roger. Arm your RCS now.
       70:31:59 CC  And we're ready for you to turn the batteries on.
       70:32:04 C   ...
       70:32:07 C   Okay. The ... should read 2500, ... 2450.
       70:32:16 CC  Roger. We agree with that.
       70:32:18 P   These batteries are ON. We have a light.
       70:32:25 CC  Okay. And we would like to have you check your
                    peroxide temperature and pressure, please.
       70:32:34 P   Okay. Peroxide pressure seems to have dropped to
                    500 psi, and temperature is about 65.
       70:32:39 CC  Roger .We copy. Would you put your Antenna Selector
                    to REENTRY, please?

             70:32:46  CC   Okay.
             70:32:57  CC   Okay. Your load looks good, based on the computer
                            readout on the ground.
             70:33:02  P    Roger. Same thing here.
             70:33:11  P    Is our T<sub>R</sub> minus 256 out?
             70:33:14  CC   Say again.
             70:34:42  CC   Okay, IX. We're ready to transmit T<sub>R</sub>.
             70:34:46  C    Okay. We're ready for it. Standing by. Okay.
             70:34:55  CC   It's okay on the ground.
             70:34:57  C    Okay. They all check out good.
             70:34:59  CC   Good.
             70:35:07  C    Okay, Houston. Gemini IX. Both RCS rings A and B
                            check out good. All control modes.
             70:35:15  CC   Roger, Tom.
             70:36:23  C    Houston, Gemini IX. Our Pre-Retro Check List is
                            complete at this time. Take a break at this time.
             70:36:31  CC   Roger.
             70:36:37  C    ... Captain Hartley guarantees big boat is on the
                            spot?
             70:36:43  CC   We couldn't copy that, Tom.
             70:36:46  C    Roger. Does Captain Hartley guarantee that the big
                            boat's going to be on the spot?
             70:36:52  CC   I think that you'll know where you're landing better
                            than they know where they are.
             70:36:57  C    Roger.
              70:36:59 CC   Be careful.

        70:37:23 C   Houston, Gemini IX. Do you want he to leave the
                     main power up or ... most of the time?
        70:37:32 CC  Yes. Let's leave them up for the rest of the time.
        70:37:37 C   Okay.

                          ANTIGUA

                     List?
        70:39:58 C   Roger. We have completed all the reentry stowage
                     and we have completed all the Pre-Retro Check
                     List. Standing by now for T<sub>R</sub> minus 256.

        70:44:01 CC  Go ahead.
        70:44:03 C   Roger. You might have ECON check our water quantity
                     pressure ... We can't get a full charge to
                     the gun any more.
        70:44:12 CC  Roger. We understand that you can't get a full

                      charge to the gun. We're about to get to LOS.
                      We'll probably talk to you at Canary.

          71:09:37 CC Roger.
          71:16:35 CC Gemini IX, Houston. Approaching LOS, Tananarive.
          71:16:51 P  He has LOS.
          71:21:02 C  We are at T<sub>R</sub> minus 256 now.

       71:21:32 P    Okay. I am going to the Recharger switch right
                     now. It's OPEN.
       71:21:40 C    OPEN.
       71:22:02 P    T<sub>R</sub> minus 256 Second Check List. I'll just read
                     this out to you, Tom. Okay?
       71:22:05 C    Sounds good.
       71:22:13 P    Got a crazy sky out there. Look at that!
       71:22:24 C    Looks like we're going to see it like that for awhile.
       71:22:26 P    Yes.
       71:22:37 C    Boy, that's beautiful!
       71:22:58 P    Oh, that looks like something out of a Biblical
                     story; a couple of stars shining, an orange and
                     a blue sky.
       71:23:04 C    Holding steady.

       71:24:11 P    Roger. We're currently set up but we'd like a

                        time hack to check it.
           71:24:16 CC  Roger. I'll give you a hack at 22 minutes.

           71:24:50 P   Roger. We're right on the event timer and also on
                        the computer. We're counting down real well.
           71:24:56 CC  Okay.
           71:24:59 P   Computer is in REENTRY at this time.
           71:25:01 CC  Roger.
           71:25:06 CC  We don't have anything else for you. We'll be

           71:25:10 P   Okay. Thanks a lot for the help, Bill.
           71:25:12 CC  Roger.
           71:25:13 C   We'll see you back in Houston.
           71:25:43 C   Okay. We'll get these other punches right on the
                        1 minute.
           71:25:49 P   Okay.
           71:25:50 C   Everything's running fine. Everything's 1 minute
                        down and 1 minute up.
           71:26:11 P   Okay. I've got the 256-Second Check List completed
                        down at the bottom, and my part at the top, with
                        the exception of where I am right now. I'll read
                        right through.
            71:26:17 C  Okay.
            71:26:19 P  And - you will be ...

            71:26:51      C      Are you having any luck?
            71:26:53      P      Well, I just pulled the pin out about a quarter of
                                 an inch so I can get it out, because it's so hard
                                 to get out.
            71:27:05      C      Think I'll do the same thing after Retrofire.
            71:27:19      C      After you get your camera on the floor, then pull
                                 your D-Ring out.

         71:53:42 CC  Okay?
         71:53:44 C   That's affirm.
         71:53:46 C   Couldn't we get a lot of these switches off now?
                      You get the Maneuver Thrusters, I'll get all
                      these - -
         71:53:50 P   Okay. You get those on that side, and I'll take
                      a look at what we have over here.
         71:54:01 C   - - These Attitude Control and Fuel and Temperature
                      are all OFF. Cryo Quantity is OFF. Okay, Turn
                      the Heater - Left Heater is OFF. Right Heater is
                      OFF. Fuel Cell is OFF.
         71:54:29 P   Okay, Tom. You were at nominal. Aft was 296, you
                      had 298. And nominal up/down was 112 and you had
                      125.
         71:54:43 P   Boy! There was a delay between the third and
	Page 336

                     fourth retro.
        71:54:46 C   Yes.
        71:54:47 P   Boy, oh boy!
        71:54:50 P   Okay. You've got the P and the 400K over there,
                     right?
        71:54:55 C   Check.
        71:54:58 P   Okay. I'm all set till we get to 70K.
        71:55:02 C   Okay. Lock. Retro aft. Understand ... to left.
                     Start blackout.
        71:55:11 CC  Gemini IX, Hawaii. We have 1 minute to LOS and
                     standing by.
        71:55:14 C   Roger, Hawaii. See you back in Houston.
        71:55:17 CC  Roger.
        71:55:22 P   That's a real kick, isn't it?
        71:55:24 C   Real long steady -
        71:55:26 P   Man! I tell you though, I waited a long time for
                     that fourth retro.
        71:55:35 P   Okay, Tom. Let's fly the Reentry the way we can.
        71:55:38 C   Power on ...
        71:55:49 C   Okay ...
        71:55:59 P   What time is it? I've got all the Fuel Cell switches
                     OFF and my circuit breaker panel's OFF - or
                     I can get it OFF. And we can get all these pumps
                     OFF. We don't have them any more, do we?
        71:56:09 C   Fuel Pumps coming OFF.
        71:56:11 P   Okay.
        71:56:14 P   And what was tape time, Tom?
        71:56:20 C   19 plus 52.
	Page 337

                   71:56:37      P       18 plus 52. Okay. I've got that written down.
                                         It's back here, though.
                   71:56:41      C       Get ready and I'll call them off before I hit it
                                         on.
                   71:56:47      P       Okay.
                   71:56:48      C       I've got the jettison right there.
                   71:57:06      C       How about a little computer.
                   71:57:09      P       You bet your life it came on normally. I would
                                         push START COMP - I don't want it to freeze so - -
                   71:57:19       P      Yes. Let's see, we've got 2300 in Ring A, 2300
                                         in Ring B.
                   71:57:23       C      ...
                   71:57:26       P      And we're using the remainder at this time.  Scanners
                                         are OFF; Gyros are ON; Radar is OFF.  I guess
                                         we can't push much else off, Tom.
                   71:57:40       C      All set on you?  Over there on the pulse?
                   71:57:46       P      Yes.  All set.
                    71:57:47      C      Really going to feel good to feel these g's. I'm
                                         not kidding you.
                   71:57:50       P      How high do you think we'll get up there?
                   71:57:52       C      ... what we had going out on lock.
                    71:57:55      P      Oh, really?
                    71:57:56      C      Packed itself way down.
                    71:58:34      P      Picked up sunlight.
                    71:58:36      P      Oh boy!
                    71:58:41      C      That's it now.  There's no doubt about it.
                    71:58:43      P      Man, that's - that's really - really something!
                    71:58:53      P      You got that horizon? I don't see the horizon.

	Page 338

       71:58:55 C   Had it for a second.
       71:58:58 P   Okay.
       71:59:35 P   Well, we're still moving east, according to the
                    computer.
       71:59:39 C   Well, I've got the horizon out there now. Look.
       71:59:48 P   Boy! That's pretty out there, Tom.
       71:59:51 C   Far as seeing sights, you haven't seen anything
                    yet. Wait till you see the big fireball.
       72:00:44 P   What's all that stuff coming out there behind us?
       72:00:46 C   Oh, just some pyro.
       72:00:50 P   Why did you start retro pack just now?
       72:00:53 C   The retro pack will be behind us and above us and
                    look like it's up there.
       72:01:14 P   There's that horizon.
       72:01:27 P   If you want to, go to left to 50 degrees.
       72:01:29 C   Okay.
       72:01:45 P   I've got to show a little bias in that last bit of
                    information I gave you.
       72:01:48 CC  Hello, Gemini IX. This your Houston Prime Contractor
                    standing by.
       72:01:49 P   I said 65, but that's based on 55 being nominal.
                    So it would be bank left 60 degrees, Tom, in case
                    we lose the computer.
       72:02:09 P   And it would be reverse main type.
       72:02:37 P   Okay? If we lose comp at left bank 60, and reverse
                    bank on time, or would it be bank left 60 and bank
                    right - let's see - 50.
       72:03:30 P   We're over the US.
       72:03:56 C   Retro bank nominal is left 50 degrees.

	Page 339

           72:03:57 P   Retro bank nominal is left 50 degrees. Got that
                        written down there?
           72:04:02 C   Yes.
           72:04:03 P   If you don't, I'll look it up again.
           72:04:10 C   The right ...
           72:04:12 P   Okay. If you've got it, I won't look it up. Left
                        50 degrees I'm sure but those numbers I gave you
                        were back-up angles - back-up "lost comp angles"
                        based upon our Retrofire. I feel certain we'll get
                        an update here pretty sudden anyway.
           72:04:52 P   Bank left 50, bank right 60. You have the other
                        numbers now? Okay.
           72:05:13 P   There's the moon up there.

                              TEXAS

           72:05:18 CC  Okay, Gemini IX. We're ready with the Retro update
                        when you're ready to copy.
           72:05:24 P   Go.
           72:05:25 CC  400K is 19 plus 37. Skip down to blackout. That's
                        22 plus 01; end blackout, 27 plus 07; drogue, 28
                        plus 43; main, 30 plus 08. Your downrange needle
                        deflection, 10 plus 94.
           72:05:50 P   Roger. We've got our 400K, 19 plus 37; blackout,
                        22 plus 01; and blackout, 27 plus 07; drogue at
                        28 plus 43; main at 30 plus 08; downrange, 10 plus
                        94.
            72:06:11 P  Okay. 400K is 19 plus 37, Tom.
           72:06:25 CC  There's a - that looks like it was based on your
                        IVI's. We'll be getting you any other data we
                        can from radar.
            72:06:32 P  Roger. Understand.

	Page 340

       72:06:35 C    Hey, and we have the deflection within one second
                     400K!
        72:06:38 CC  Very good.
        72:06:42 C   Going to roll left 50 degrees.
        72:06:44 P   Okay, Tom. Roll left 50.
        72:07:05 C   Real good beginning.
        72:07:17 CC  Gemini IX, Houston. Got your bank angle?
        72:07:23 C   Roger. We're rolling left 50 right now.
        72:07:29 CC  Okay. Your back-up bank angles are 28 degrees
                     left, and bank right 38. RET RB is 25 plus 27.
        72:07:40 P   Back-up bank left 28: bank right 38; RET RB 25
                     plus 27.
        72:07:45 CC  Roger.
        72:07:46 C   Check.
        72:07:53 P   That's back-up, Tom. 50 degrees. Go to 50 degrees.
        72:07:57 C   Okay.
        72:07:58 P   Okay. This is back-up angle of 50 degrees.
       72:08:01 C    What's our status?
       72:08:03 P    They haven't had any banks yet, have they?
       72:08:05 C    Yes.
        72:08:32 C   ...
       72:08:35 P    Yes.
       72:08:37 P    Okay. Even the computer is GO, Tom.
       72:08:38 CC   See you after blackout.
       72:08:39 C    Okay. Go ahead. Put it on, Gene.

	Page 341

             72:08:44   P    Roger. Blackout is 22 plus 01.
             72:08:59  P     No Guidance yet, right?
             72:09:01  C     No.
             72:09:03  P     What time's that thing supposed to ring in?
             72:09:19  P     There's Guidance, Tom. Turn deflection in about
                             20, 40, 80, 120, miles. 120 miles. Want you to
                             roll right for that position.
             72:09:36  C     Roll right? ... high?
             72:09:39  C     Say again.
             72:09:40  C     There's Guidance, Tom. Turn-rate needle deflection
                             is about 20, 40, 80 - about 120 miles.
             72:09:41  P     Okay. It's coming in real nice.
             72:09:45  P     All for roll right.
             72:09:47  C     You want to fly it?
             72:09:49  P     Fly it. It looks good. That's what they said
                             about 94 when we got 120.
             72:09:53  C     Okay.
             72:09:54   P    We just passed over Houston.
             72:10:00   P    Look at that!
             72:10:05   P    Okay. It's calling for bank right slightly. Push
                             START COMP and a full left.
             72:10:20   P    Keep going now. You've got a good braking line,
                             now.
             72:10:48   P    I got another minute and a half yet.
             72:10:53   P    Tell you when.
             72:10:58   P    Beautiful out here, isn't it?
             72:11:00   P    Okay. Still full left and earth is coming slowly,
                             Tom.
	Page 342

            72:11:07      P      Starting to come in slowly and we're coming in at
                                 low range.
            72:11:22      C      ...
            72:11:27      P      Okay, She's coming in Tom, slowly. You're about
                                 40 miles till earth. 40 miles to it. Still coming
                                 in closer. You can go ahead and turn it if you
                                 want to.
            72:11:42      C      Okay.
            72:11:43      P      Okay.  It's beautiful....
            72:11:50      P      Okay. Now we're going to start rolling downrange
                                 just about any time. Crossrange looks real good.
            72:12:00      P      Boy! What a fireball! Whew!
            72:12:02      P      Okay. Commanding you roll right. What a fireball!
            72:12:14      P      Boy! We're really doing something, aren't we?
            72:12:18      C      2 g's.
            72:12:20      P      Okay.
            72:12:21      C      2 g's.
            72:12:22      P      Boy! It's just about 5.
            72:12:24      P      Okay. Still holding on. The time is just about
                                 out.
            72:12:26      C      That's good enough. Boy, look at that fire!
            72:13:06      P      Okay. GO on roll right, Tom.
            72:13:11      P      Beautiful!
            72:13:12      C      Keep rolling right.
            72:13:22      P      I wish I could catch up with those numbers like he
                                 can.
            72:13:26      C      Keep rolling right.
	Page 343

             72:13:29 P   Keep it rolling right. Beautiful!
             72:13:47 C   Beautiful!
             72:13:50 C   Roger.
             72:13:51 P   Okay.
             72:14:05 C   I think we're coming at it.
             72:14:07 CC  Gemini IX, Houston. Your drogue and main times
                          are good.
             72:14:16 C   Roger. Can you read me?
             72:14:27 CC  Read you loud and clear.
             72:14:32 C   We are absolutely GO.
             72:14:34 CC  Very good.
             72:14:48 C   We're rolling to the left. 2-1/2 feet.
