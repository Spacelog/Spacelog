CC: Roger.

[00:02:50:28]
C: Hello, Hawaii. Gemini IX.

[00:02:50:30]
CC: Gemini IX, Hawaii.

[00:02:50:32]
C: Roger. We've had a computer malfunction. Want
     to clue you in on it.

[00:02:50:39]
CC: Roger. Go ahead.

[00:02:50:42]
C: Okay. We noticed this after the N<sub>SR</sub> burn. Every
     time we would go from RENDEZVOUS back to CATCH-UP,
     the COMP light would come on without starting and
     the IVIs would display. This showed we were getting
     some signal in that would start the computation
     cycle. Okay, went to RENDEZVOUS and after
     the total data points, we got the first solution
     displayed. The START COMP light then came on and
     it cranked up the solution for this range, and it
     would not give a second data point. We went over
     to CATCH-UP and it had the same values in CATCH-UP
     that we had in RENDEZVOUS and, naturally, the
     light was on, which shows that we are holding it
     in the register. It appears that after every
     eighth data point all we'll get is that solution
     and nothing more. Our Delta-Delta-R shows that
     we are about 2-1/2 miles high for 15 which is 12.5
     and the list isn't too bad and the radar is doing
     beautifully. You want to relay that on to Houston?

[00:02:51:49]
_page : 34
CC: Roger. Will do.

[00:02:51:55]
CC: Everything is looking real good here on the
     ground. We still read you've got solid lock.

[00:02:52:00]
C: Roger. We do have solid locking. Occasionally
     it will break and the needles act too wild.

[00:02:52:05]
CC: Roger.

[00:02:53:21]
C: Hawaii, Gemini IX. We're back in Rendezvous Mode
     to try to stay Closed Loop. We are getting good
     Delta-R's out of our computation. We will let
     you know when we get our next solution.

[00:02:53:32]
CC: Roger. Will do. And Houston says they'll talk
     to you about the problem over the States.

[00:02:53:36]
C: Roger. It's just the same as if we START COMP
     every time we turn to the Catch-up and Rendezvous
     Modes.

[00:02:53:42]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[00:02:53:50]
CC: Gemini IX, Hawaii. Houston says they confirm
     the Delta-H.

[00:02:53:55]
C: Roger.

CC: Gemini IX, Hawaii.

[00:02:54:57]
C: Hawaii. Go.

[00:02:54:59]

[00:03:00:01]
CC: Hello, Gemini IX. Houston here.

[00:03:00:03]
C: Roger. Houston, Gemini IX. We've just gone
     through another cycle on the computer in the
     Rendezvous Mode. It brings up the first solution
     and then immediately goes down to give us the
     same as if we had pushed START COMP, Neil.

[00:03:00:15]
CC: Roger. And understand it does that at the eighth
     data point. Is that correct?

[00:03:00:18]
C: Yes. We're coming up to 9 degrees and going down
     to Aline the Platform.

[00:03:00:22]
CC: Roger. Understand you are going to Aline now.
     We're going to try to work out the best time we
     can for you to cycle into Rendezvous Mode so that
     you get a correct solution at the proper time.

[00:03:00:36]
C: Okay. We already thought about this one up here.

[00:03:00:40]
CC: I'm sure you did.

[00:03:02:09]
C: Hello, Houston. IX here.

[00:03:02:10]
CC: Go ahead, IX.

[00:03:02:13]
C: Okay. We just thought of another thing up here,
     Neil. If we get that solution right at that
     point, and it's bad, and we have to go to CATCH-UP
     to make the burns, we will have to treat the
     IVIs to do it.

     and how many right?

[00:03:36:10]
C: 2 right.

[00:03:36:14]
P: 2 right. You're burning it, right?

[00:03:36:16]
C: One.

[00:03:36:39]
C: MARK.

[00:03:36:43]
P: Okay. We'll get our clocks started at 13 30.
     Looks like you initiated fairly well on the
     angle, Tom.

[00:03:36:46]
_page : 42
C: Okay.

[00:03:36:51]
P: Here, let me get 25, 6 and 7 in 0 if I can. That
     right here?

[00:03:36:58]
C: No, not yet. Not yet. Don't do anything with
     it.

[00:03:37:00]
P: Okay.You can set your clock to 1 minute.

[00:03:37:03]
C: Okay. It's coming down to 1 minute.

[00:03:37:08]
C: ... functions ...

[00:03:37:10]
P: 27 forward, 1 up and 1 right. Affirm?

[00:03:37:13]
C: Yes.

[00:03:37:15]
C: 1 minute. Now if we can see in this thing we
     can only get 1 minute.

[00:03:37:22]
P: Okay. 15 seconds. Hey! see it.

[00:03:37:24]
C: Oh yes! It's out there, man. It's really out
     there!

[00:03:37:25]
P: Boy, I hope that's not the shroud ...

[00:03:37:26]
P: Okay. Coming up on 1 minute. Ready? Start your
     clock.

[00:03:37:27]
P: Mark it.

[00:03:37:33]
C: Marked it.

[00:03:37:43]
C: Did you time my burn by any chance?

[00:03:37:55]
P: No, Tom, I didn't. I was starting to and we hit
     it so fast then.

[00:03:38:05]
P: Houston, Gemini IX. Is that 29.9, 23.31 miles?
     Range-Rate is 142.

[00:03:38:46]
C: There! It's working.

[00:03:38:51]
P: What is?

[00:03:38:54]
_page : 43
C: Closed Loop. It snapped off.

[00:03:38:58]
P: Okay. Let's go to - I want an angle and a Range-Rate
     of 225.

[00:03:38:59]
C: It's still in my reflected sunlight.

[00:03:39:01]
P: Ready.

[00:03:39:03]
P: Mark it.

[00:03:39:04]
C: Stand by.

[00:03:39:05]
P: We've got it right on.

[00:03:39:22]
P: We may have to go up on this one, Tom.

[00:03:39:29]
C: This Closed Loop has been pretty good.

[00:03:40:49]
P: Loop is cranking.

[00:03:40:53]
C: Yes, you can see it out there. We're getting
     dark. It's still in reflected sunlight. It's
     going to disappear shortly. It's getting dim.
     It's getting very dim. And I have the flashing
     lights.

[00:03:41:15]
P: You have them?

[00:03:41:17]
C: Houston, Gemini IX. I've got the ACQ lights.

[00:03:41:22]
P: I've got them too. I see them. Oh great, Tom!
     4.9. We're going to have a little UP correction
     on this one, but --

[00:03:41:24]
C: All right. We're in business.

[00:03:41:27]
P: And we're cranking, by the way.

[00:03:41:31]
P: Let's see, 4.9 - 4.9 and 35.

[00:03:41:36]
C: I don't have them.

[00:03:41:39]
P: I had them though.

[00:03:41:41]
C: Yes, I did earlier.

[00:03:41:42]
_page : 44
P: ...

[00:03:41:43]
C: The ACQ lights have disappeared again.

[00:03:41:47]
P: Three of them.

[00:03:41:55]
C: Three of them, right?

[00:03:42:00]
P: Three or four of them.

[00:03:42:05]
C: Well, I've lost them. Still tracking the radar.

[00:03:42:10]
P: 2 aft and 3 up. Okay?

[00:03:42:14]
C: Yes! Now I've completely lost them, Gene.

[00:03:42:19]
P: Maybe roll a little bit. They were on though,
     Tom, I saw them.

[00:03:42:21]
C: Yes.

[00:03:42:23]
P: Saw them blinking.

[00:03:42:24]
C: There they are!

[00:03:42:26]
P: Yes, there they are.

[00:03:42:27]
C: There they are again!

[00:03:42:28]
P: Okay. 7 minutes. We're going to have a slight
     UP correction, Tom.

[00:03:42:30]
C: Good?

[00:03:42:34]
P: What time do you have?

[00:03:42:36]
C: Okay. 5 56.

[00:03:42:39]
P: Okay. We've got another minute to go ...

[00:03:42:41]
C: ... just a faint little ...

[00:03:42:44]
P: 34.8 ... 34.8

[00:03:42:48]

C: Hello, RKV, Gemini IX.

[00:03:44:20]
CC: Gemini IX. Houston standing by.

[00:03:44:38]
CC: Gemini IX. Houston standing by.

[00:03:44:42]
P: Roger. This is Gemini IX at 7 minutes, elevation,
     5.69.

[00:03:50:14]
P: Elevation, 54.3; range, 9.35; Range-Rate, 89 feet
     per second.

[00:03:50:21]
CC: Roger. We're less than a minute from LOS.

[00:03:53:34]
C: Okay. The burn is at 16 40 after transfer 5
     degrees right in the reticle and still see the
     flashing light.

[00:03:53:50]
C: 1 up, 1 aft, 20. Okay. 7 miles and 63.3.

[00:03:53:53]
P: 19 minutes, Tom.

[00:03:54:12]
P: Okay. Here's our plot coming right in here.
     Okay? Okay. What are we coming up on now,
     anything much?

[00:03:54:24]
C: 17 40.

[00:03:54:25]
P: Okay.

[00:03:54:29]
P: Boy, I feel bent over like a pretzel!

[00:03:54:34]
C: There are no stars out there either.

[00:03:54:38]
P: No, that moon is just blinding. You don't have
     any of them (stars) period!

[00:03:54:41]
P: Sure glad there are flashing lights.

[00:03:54:43]
C: I've got some running lights on him.

[00:03:54:47]
P: I've lost him entirely now.

[00:03:54:53]
C: What's that?

[00:03:54:55]
_page : 46
P: Hey, that is Scorpio. The head of Scorpio behind
     the moon.

[00:03:54:59]
C: Yes.

[00:03:55:02]
P: And Antares.

[00:03:55:05]
P: I've never seen anything so bright as that moon.

[00:03:55:07]
C: Yes, it's blinding me.

[00:03:55:13]
P: I don't have him at all now.

[00:03:55:16]
C: I don't either. I'm tracking him on radar. The
     needles are - -

[00:03:55:19]
P: Okay. 19 minutes. Radar looks pretty good.

[00:03:55:24]
C: - - Sure does. Lots better than what we've
     been getting.

[00:03:55:34]
P: What did we do with the ... by the way?

[00:03:55:36]
C: I've got it.

[00:03:55:37]
P: Okay.

[00:03:55:38]
P: Okay. Ready?

[00:03:55:40]
P: Mark it.

[00:03:55:42]
C: I've got him again.

[00:03:55:43]
P: How's the angle?

[00:03:55:44]
C: Now. I hit it. I'm right on him.

[00:03:55:48]
P: 7 seconds late, but we'll take it.

[00:03:55:50]
C: 7 seconds late only.

[00:03:55:53]
P: 7 seconds. 72.5, 5.13 miles, Range-Rate is 55
     feet per second. Looks fairly good, Tom. Matter
     fact, this is looking real good. 72.5, 5.13.
     Coming right in here.

[00:03:56:38]
_page : 47
C: Good show. We have to get in there somehow,
     Gene.

[00:03:56:41]
P: How about a planet, or can you tell it?

[00:03:56:43]
C: I can't really tell it yet, little bit of bias -
     maybe when I rolled to the right I goofed this
     up, but I think the Closed Loop will probably
     take us back in.

[00:03:56:46]
P: I didn't like the Closed Loop transfer, but the
     correction seemed to be all right.

[00:03:56:53]
C: Yes.

[00:03:56:55]
P: Look at those needles!

[00:03:57:00]
C: ... I don't have any flashing lights either,
     Gene.

[00:03:57:04]
P: Yes. Just do the best you can and I'll take a
     reading.

[00:03:57:08]
C: Hit it.

[00:03:57:10]
P: MARK.

[00:03:57:14]
C: Can't tell ...

[00:03:57:26]
P: 77.1 degrees, 4.4O miles and 53 feet per second.

[00:03:57:33]
C: I've lost my place.

[00:03:57:42]
P: Okay. I need a critical angle at 22 minutes.

[00:03:57:53]
C: There he is. I can see the red light on him
     now. The moon is giving him reflected moonlight.

[00:03:58:00]
P: Yes, reflected moonlight is right. It sure is.
     You can almost see him tumble.

[00:03:58:01]
C: Yes.

[00:03:58:02]
P: Watch the ACQ light go around now.

[00:03:58:03]
_page : 48
C: Yes.

[00:03:58:05]
P: Okay. At 22 minutes I need a 4 40 76.

[00:03:58:07]
C: This is Gemini IX transmitting in the blind. We
     have him in reflected moonlight at approximately
     4 miles.

[00:03:58:17]
P: Am I right - I don't expect this correction to
     be little or nothing, Tom. Okay.

[00:03:58:19]
C: Oh, look at that moonlight!

[00:03:58:24]
P: Reflected moonlight! I can almost see an ACQ
     light, I think.

[00:03:58:31]
P: Sure can. I see something red. Okay, Tom.
     Here we go. 19:07. That's all right, 22:07.
     You ready?

[00:03:58:43]
P: Mark it.

[00:03:59:00]
C: Who have we got this going away to.

[00:03:59:05]
P: The Out-of-Plane that's looking around ...

[00:03:59:07]
C: A little left.

[00:03:59:10]
P: 10.8 in 83.

[00:03:59:14]
C: 10.8.

[00:03:59:19]
P: See, the trouble is you give me one radar angle
     and one visual angle and that's what hurts.

[00:03:59:21]
C: Yes.

[00:03:59:22]
P: This says about 3 down.

[00:03:59:33]
_extra : CARNARVON
C: Well, if we'd have applied that number we'd have
     really gone down.

[00:03:59:34]
_page : 49
CC: Gemini IX, Carnarvon CAP COM. We're standing by.

[00:03:59:38]
C: Roger. Carnarvon. We've got the ATDA in reflected
     moonlight at about 3 1/2 miles and it looks like
     we've got the Out-of-Plane wired and we're coming
     up the pipe.

[00:03:59:43]
CC: Good show!

[00:03:59:50]
P: 04 on aft and 3 down, but I - I'd buy 3 down. One's
     a radar angle and one's a visual angle.

[00:03:59:58]
C: I think our Out-of-Plane is just about 0.

[00:04:00:00]
P: 83. Okay. I'm going to take an angle and give it
     to them right now.

[00:04:00:02]
P: You on?

[00:04:00:08]
C: Yes. 23, 25. Coming up with the solution.

[00:04:00:12]
P: That burn is going to play heck with us.

[00:04:00:22]
P: Carnarvon, we're at 88.2 degrees and 3 miles.

[00:04:00:24]
C: 3 forward and 2 down.

[00:04:00:25]
CC: Roger.

[00:04:00:26]
C: 3 forward and 2 down?

[00:04:00:27]
P: Right.

[00:04:00:28]
C: Okay.

[00:04:00:31]
C: MARK.

[00:04:00:36]
P: You don't even need the forward. What'd you put,
     2 forward or 3?

[00:04:00:38]
C: 3. It's right in there, Gene. PULSE okay. Go
     ahead.

[00:04:00:42]
P: Okay. Let's see if we can zero 25, 6 and 7.

[00:04:00:44]
_page : 50
C: Okay. Going to CATCH-UP.

[00:04:00:48]
P: Carnarvon. We just applied the Closed-Loop solution
     of 3 forward and 2 down.

[00:04:00:58]
C: Okay. Go ahead now that we're in CATCH-UP, Gene.
     Hey, the thing isn't.

[00:04:01:04]
P: No it isn't.

[00:04:01:05]
C: Holding steady at 45 feet per second.

[00:04:01:17]
P: Okay. Looks good.

[00:04:01:22]
P: Okay.

[00:04:01:24]
C: Lean it forward just a bit.

[00:04:01:27]
P: I can see the red ACQ lights all right. Okay, Tom,
     what time do you have? 25?

[00:04:01:28]
C: Yes.

[00:04:01:31]
P: Going to get an angle?

[00:04:01:33]
C: Yes.

[00:04:01:35]
P: Okay. Now get it.

[00:04:01:43]
C: Got it.

[00:04:01:46]
P: Oh!

[00:04:01:48]
C: Carnarvon, Gemini IX. We have the red running
     lights at this time, 2-1/2 miles.

[00:04:01:53]
CC: Roger.

[00:04:01:57]
C: Oh, we're going to brake right into the moon, Gene.

[00:04:01:59]
P: Yes.

[00:04:02:05]
C: Carnarvon, Gemini IX. It looks like we're going to
     be braking directly into the moon and it should be
     an interesting problem.

[00:04:02:06]
CC: Roger.

[00:04:02:12]
_page : 51
P: Gemini IX. Elevation 94.9, range 2.37 miles, 39
     feet per second.

[00:04:02:22]
P: Coming up right under, Tom. Here's your last
     point.

[00:04:02:25]
C: Good show, Gene.

[00:04:02:29]
P: Okay. I want to get on LOS here, Tom, at about
     5 minutes after - 5 seconds after.

[00:04:02:36]
P: Don't use the moon for inertial reference.

[00:04:02:41]
C: (Laughter) Okay.

[00:04:02:43]
P: Okay. You ready?

[00:04:02:44]
P: Mark it.

[00:04:02:51]
C: Go, Gene.

[00:04:02:58]
P: Too fast. Way too fast, Tom. 2 miles.

[00:04:03:02]
P: Carnarvon, Gemini IX. Elevation 99.0 degrees, 2
     miles, 37 feet per second.

[00:04:03:10]
P: Okay, Tom. Let me take another one on this, but
     that was 4 - no, that's about right, I'm sorry,
     that's exactly right. 4.1 degrees in a minute.
     Let's try it again.

[00:04:03:20]
C: I'm right on it. Now you can see it tumble.

[00:04:03:22]
P: Right here. Here we go. You can see it tumble
     because of the ACQ light.

[00:04:03:23]
C: The two red ones.

[00:04:03:24]
P: Okay. At 5 seconds aft, I want to see 103 degrees.

[00:04:03:27]
C: Okay. Are you ready?

[00:04:03:28]
P: Mark it.

[00:04:03:32]
C: Got it. I might have been off a tenth.

[00:04:03:53]
P: 1.67 miles.

[00:04:04:02]
_page : 52
P: This is Gemini IX. Elevation 102.7, 1.67 miles,
     and 34 feet per second and we can actually determine
     that it is tumbling because of the ACQ light
     and the running light variations.

[00:04:04:21]
CC: Roger.

[00:04:04:23]
P: Okay, Tom. Let's see if we can get another one
     here at - I want to see about 106.7 to 107. You
     ready?

[00:04:04:29]
C: Yes.

[00:04:04:30]
P: There goes your radar. Okay?

[00:04:04:31]
C: It's coming in and out.

[00:04:04:32]
P: Stand by.

[00:04:04:33]
P: Mark it.

[00:04:04:37]
P: That's all right. 106.8, Tom. We're null inertially.

[00:04:04:40]
C: Good show, Gene.

[00:04:04:41]
P: Gemini IX is 106.8 degrees, 1.32 miles and 34 feet
     per second.

[00:04:05:01]
P: Okay, again. I'll take it, Tom, at - Boy, no stars!

[00:04:05:03]
C: No stars at all!

[00:04:05:36]
P: Okay. Let's try and get this one.

[00:04:05:38]
C: I've got one, but - -

[00:04:05:40]
P: Get inertial.

[00:04:05:42]
CC: Gemini IX, Carnarvon. We're 30 seconds to LOS.

[00:04:05:43]
C: Roger. And we've got it wired inertial.

[00:04:05:47]
C: This is Gemini IX at 1 mile. We can determine
     distance between the running lights.

[00:04:05:50]
CC: Roger.

[00:04:05:55]
_page : 53
P: Point 98.

[00:04:05:59]
C: Should we burn to brake it down some?

[00:04:06:00]
P: Yes, let's go to push START COMP.

[00:04:06:02]
C: I've got a START COMP. Brake her down.

[00:04:06:04]
P: 32 feet per second, Tom. You might just as well
     take it down to 20.

[00:04:06:10]
C: Okay. Stand by. RATE COMMAND to burn.

[00:04:06:14]
P: Houston. Gemini IX at 110.1 degrees; 1 mile; 32
     feet per second, and we're braking off to 20 feet
     per second at this time.

[00:04:06:29]
C: Okay. There's 11-back to PULSE.

[00:04:06:48]
P: Okay. Let's get some LOS, Tom, anytime you can
     again.

[00:04:06:49]
C: Okay.

[00:04:06:52]
P: Now you have a little star out there on that rascal.
     Look at him.

[00:04:06:54]
C: Got a little star for you.

[00:04:06:56]
P: Okay. If you've got a little star, I'll give you
     the ranges here.

[00:04:06:59]
P: Inertially we look pretty good but is anything,
     maybe we were just - -

[00:04:07:02]
C: I can see the red and green lights now on the ATDA.

[00:04:07:04]
P: - - just a little and we want to keep going down.

[00:04:07:05]
C: Going down.

[00:04:07:07]
P: Go down; I agree.

[00:04:07:10]
P: Go down for 5 seconds.

[00:04:07:13]
P: Stand by. Okay. You got that star behind him?

[00:04:07:19]
_page : 54
C: Yes. I have just one little star.

[00:04:07:21]
P: .64 miles. And you've got about - you should have
     about 20 feet per second.

[00:04:07:26]
C: I'll look at that.

[00:04:07:27]
P: There's 19 feet per second, Tom.

[00:04:07:28]
C: That's good, Gene.

[00:04:07:29]
C: Okay. Now ... you back, push START COMP.

[00:04:07:30]
C: MARK.

[00:04:07:31]
C: Go.

[00:04:07:32]
P: Okay. You're coming in on half a mile with 19 feet
     per second. You're still going down a little.
     Still going down a little. Out-of-Plane looks good.

[00:04:07:44]
C: Maybe a little more to the left.

[00:04:07:46]
P: A little left, maybe. Coming up on a half mile.
     Just hold your 19 feet per second, Tom. Down and
     left a little. See, we're following that moon all
     the way up. That's why it's so bright. Okay.
     You're at a half mile right now at 19 feet per
     second.

[00:04:08:04]
C: Up or down ...

[00:04:08:07]
P: You're at 22 feet per second. Look, it's still
     going down a bit, Tom. It's not tumbling much now.
     Okay, there's - coming up on 2600 feet. There's
     2400 feet and 22 feet per second. 2200 feet and
     22 feet per second. Tom, you might want to take
     off - -

[00:04:08:38]
C: Let's take off some more.

[00:04:08:40]
P: - - Okay. Push -

[00:04:08:41]
P: Okay. You're good. Press START COMP.

[00:04:08:42]
P: You're coming in at 1800 feet, 22 feet per second.
     Are you in RATE COMMAND? Okay. 1800 feet. She's
     still going down, Tom. I think you have it now.
     Inside 1800 feet.

[00:04:09:05]
_page : 55
C: What have we got?

[00:04:09:06]
P: You've got about 13 - you have 12 feet per second.
     You've got 11 feet per second and you're at 1500,
     1400 feet. Okay. You only have 7 feet per second
     now, Tom, so hold it. You've only got 7 feet per
     second. And you're at 12 - 1300 feet.

[00:04:09:28]
C: Man, it looks like a Christmas tree out there.

[00:04:09:33]
P: You only have 7 feet per second and you're at -
     computer's working okay. You're about 1000 feet
     right now. I wonder if I should try to get any
     pictures of this.

[00:04:09:44]
C: Yes. Go ahead and try one final sequence.

[00:04:09:50]
P: You're at 1200 feet ...

[00:04:10:03]
C: I think we have the In-Plane, Out-of-Plane wired.

[00:04:10:04]
P: Okay. You're at 7 feet per second ...

[00:04:10:07]
C: ...

[00:04:10:09]
C: Oh, there he is! The whole thing! The whole moose!
     Look at that, man!

[00:04:10:10]
P: He's not moving either.

[00:04:10:11]
C: He isn't moving at all.

[00:04:10:12]
P: Okay. Tom, you're at 7 feet per second and you're
     at ... a thousand feet.

[00:04:10:19]
C: Well, maybe I'll knock it down a little more.

[00:04:10:21]
P: 7 feet per second right now. You're at 900 feet.

[00:04:10:25]
C: I've got 5 feet per second on the gage.

[00:04:10:27]
P: Okay.

[00:04:10:29]
P: Coming in at 800 feet. Still at 900 feet right now.

[00:04:10:34]
_page : 56
C: That's a weird looking machine, isn't it?

[00:04:10:36]
P: Doesn't look like it's tumbling. It may be rolling,
     but - it sure is.

[00:04:10:42]
C: Would you believe that there's a nose cone on that
     rascal?

[00:04:10:44]
P: I don't know.

[00:04:10:53]
P: I don't know, Tom. The back of the TDA is painted;
     there can't be a nose cone on it, can there?

[00:04:10:57]
C: I can't tell.

[00:04:10:59]
P: Okay. Come on baby, you're 5 feet per second and
     you're at 780 feet. Want me to turn the ACQ lights
     off? Any time you do, let me know.

[00:04:11:09]
C: No, no, let's leave them on.

[00:04:11:14]
C: We still have 60 percent fuel remaining.

[00:04:11:16]
P: Okay. Tom, you're at 660 feet.

[00:04:11:21]
C: Roger. 660 feet.

[00:04:11:24]
P: We're right In-Plane at 2 feet per second on this
     thing.

[00:04:11:27]
C: I've got about 5.

[00:04:11:28]
P: Okay.

[00:04:11:34]
P: Okay. Your angle is about 130 degrees now, so it's
     looking good. You're at 600 feet right now. 540
     feet. Boy, it's going to be nice to see that in
     daylight - we're looking at the TDA!

[00:04:11:49]
C: Hey, we've got it!

[00:04:11:50]
P: We're looking at the TDA! Sec, - -

[00:04:11:52]
C: Look at that moose!

[00:04:11:54]
P: ... in it.

[00:04:11:55]
_page : 57
C: Look at that moose!

[00:04:11:56]
C: I'm going to knock it down some - -

[00:04:11:57]
P: It's upside down, but we're looking at it!

[00:04:12:01]
P: Back up a few seconds; tape recorder just went out.

[00:04:12:04]
P: Half a "Sec". Will the lights stay on?

[00:04:12:08]
P: Boy, I wish we had a - this was daylight, we could
     see this thing better, Tom. You're coming in on
     it. What's your Range-Rate? You're at 360 feet.

[00:04:12:16]
C: Okay. I'll brake it down.

[00:04:12:19]
P: 360 feet right now.

[00:04:12:22]
C: Think I've got to stop ...

[00:04:12:25]
P: Can't see which way I'm looking.

[00:04:12:27]
P: We're looking at the bottom because it's not
     tumbling very fast.

[00:04:12:35]
C: I can't really tell.

[00:04:12:37]
P: You're at 300 feet.

[00:04:12:40]
C: The shroud is half open. The shroud is half open
     on that thing!

[00:04:12:43]
P: Is it?

[00:04:12:44]
C: It's half open!

[00:04:12:46]
P: It sure is!

[00:04:12:49]
C: The back pin didn't fire.

[00:04:12:51]
P: It's there but it's half open all right - -

[00:04:12:52]
_page : 58
C: - - It didn't fire.

[00:04:12:54]
P: It's like a clamshell. It's like a clamshell, Tom.

[00:04:13:01]
P: Okay. You're 240 feet. Like a clamshell.

[00:04:13:04]
C: Turn on the Dock light. Let's give it a try.

[00:04:13:09]
P: There's the shroud looking right at us.

[00:04:13:11]
C: Hello, Houston. Gemini IX.

[00:04:13:16]
P: Half open. It's half off too, Tom, because the
     aft lights are visible - well, they didn't come
     out, but they are both working. Half open, Tom.
     Look at that thing! You could almost knock it
     off! I feel certain you could. The band didn't
     break, I don't think.

[00:04:13:37]
C: What's the range?

[00:04:13:38]
P: Okay. Range is 120 feet right now.

[00:04:13:42]
C: Looks like those have extended.

[00:04:13:44]
_extra : HAWAII
P: Look at that thing! Darn it! What a mess! What's
     hanging from it, too. Okay. It's rolling our way,
     Tom; there's the dipole extended.

[00:04:25:18]
C: Hello, Houston. Gemini IX.

[00:04:25:20]
CC: Gemini IX, Hawaii.

[00:04:25:21]
C: How are you? I've got a weird looking machine
     here.

[00:04:25:25]
CC: What does it look like?

[00:04:25:26]
_page : 59
C: Okay. Both the clamshells of the nose cones are
     still on, but they are open wide. The front release
     has let go, the back closing bolts attached
     to the ATDA have both fired and it appears that
     one of the bolts from the band has fired. What's
     keeping it together is the slip disconnect for a
     small electrical connector that fires the bolt on
     the band.

[00:04:25:54]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[00:04:25:55]
C: So the jaws are like an alligator jaw that's open
     at 25 to 30 degrees. Both the piston springs look
     like they are fully extended.

[00:04:26:06]
CC: Roger.

[00:04:26:11]
C: Both of the back parts of the nose cone have separated
     from the ATDA and it looks like it's just held
     on by some inconceivable force there. Everything
     looks good.

[00:04:26:26]
CC: Roger. Understand. What types of rates have you
     got? How bad is it tumbling?

[00:04:26:33]
C: Okay. It's about 3 to 4 degrees per second.

[00:04:27:37]
C: 58 percent fuel remaining. We're stationkeeping
     to keep it out here between 10 and 30 feet from
     it.

[00:04:27:38]
CC: Roger. Copy.

[00:04:27:51]
C: All the ...

[00:04:27:54]
C: ... here.

[00:04:27:58]
CC: Say again, Gemini IX.

[00:04:27:59]
C: Roger. It appears that the basic rate is in roll.
     The body axis right now is merely horizontal. Very
     slight bit of yaw technically inconceivable and the
     big rates are in roll.

[00:04:28:11]
CC: Roger. Understand. Do you think there's any possibility
     of breaking the cone or shaking it loose by
     going through a few Unrigidizing-to-Rigidizing Sequences?

[00:04:28:21]
_page : 60
C: Well, I might give it a try.

[00:04:28:25]
CC: Roger.

[00:04:28:38]
C: Again, did you copy the information that it appears
     that the back explosive bolts connected to the ATDA
     have fired? Also, it is very evident that one of
     the strap bolts has fired, but also there is a
     small quick-disconnect from the pyros that fired
     the bolts from the strap. Those are still attached.

[00:04:28:56]
C: And the ATDA is basically open. So the cone is
     open 3 to 4 inches at the back on both sides. It's
     gone out in a 30-degree angle and the strap is around
     it.

[00:04:29:09]
CC: Roger. Understand. Are you in such a position
     where you could watch the Unrigidizing-to-Rigidizing?

[00:04:29:15]
C: Stand by one.

[00:04:29:47]
CC: Gemini IX, Hawaii.

[00:04:29:48]
C: Hawaii, Gemini IX. I can also see the back two
     springs, the back small spring, the little 30-pound
     springs. We're up to about 5 to 10 feet and
     jockeying it into position here. And the back bolt
     is definitely fired. I can see the spring. It's
     got the two shells apart about 2 inches. The two
     halves are 2 inches - you can see that the ...
     and the pyros - the cables on the pyros - the front
     clamshell against the strap has fired. You can see
     the black smudge marks on it. I'm now about 3 feet
     from it and those electrical connectors - the quick-disconnect
     did not connect on either one of them.

[00:04:30:40]
CC: They did not disconnect? Is that right?

[00:04:30:42]
C: - - the band is holding the whole mass together.
     Stand by one and let me give you a distance on
     this other one.

[00:04:30:55]
C: Yes, I'm trying to find the cable disconnect. I
     can't see the cable disconnect. Of course, it
     would be taut. Okay, the other one. The spring
     is gone from the back of the other half one and -
     no, pardon me, it's still there. It's separated
     from - the back is completely separated 3 to 4
     inches and I'll give you another good check. Oh,
     wait. What's holding the whole mass on there is
     the band. And half the time these pyro disconnects
     will work.

[00:04:31:24]
_page : 61
CC: Roger. Understand.

[00:04:31:26]
CC: We've got about 3 minutes here until our LOS. We'd
     like to go through one Rigidizing and Unrigidizing
     Sequence and have you watch it, if you'll get into
     position where you could watch it for them.

[00:04:31:35]
C: Stand by one. I don't want to be too close when
     those things cut loose.

[00:04:31:40]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[00:04:31:41]
C: Okay. Now on the other side, both explosive bolts
     on the band have fired; the band is held intact by
     all four of those electrical pyros that fired the
     bolts. Looks like somebody did not hook up a disconnect
     cable.

[00:04:31:54]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[00:04:31:56]
C: The disconnects did not disconnect. That's the
     only thing that's holding the whole mass intact.

[00:04:32:01]
CC: Roger.

[00:04:32:04]
C: Don't Unrigidize here. Could we hack it over the
     States?

[00:04:32:07]
CC: Roger. I was just going to suggest it. I'm
     getting too close to LOS.

[00:04:32:10]
C: Yes, and I'm too close to the nose cone, too.

[00:04:32:12]
CC: Roger.

[00:04:32:18]
C: Pass that word on to Houston that all four explosive
     bolts have fired and it is basically free from the
     ATDA but just barely held on by those four little
     pyro wires there.

[00:04:32:28]
_page : 62
CC: Roger.

[00:04:32:29]
C: Those little wires on the strap of the disconnector.

[00:04:32:34]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[00:04:32:35]
C: And we have 58 percent OAMS fuel remaining.

[00:04:32:37]
CC: Roger.

[00:04:32:42]
C: It looks like an angry alligator out here rotating
     around.

[00:04:32:46]
CC: I can imagine.

[00:04:32:57]
C: Pass the word on to Houston we can stationkeep here
     quite awhile, and also have a suggestion that we
     might put out our docking bar and go tap it.

[00:04:33:01]
CC: Roger. Stand by.

[00:04:33:03]
C: Roger.

[00:04:33:18]
CC: Gemini IX, Hawaii.

[00:04:33:20]
C: Go, Hawaii.

[00:04:33:22]
CC: Houston wants to wait and take a look at it and
     start cycling the Adapter over the States.

[00:04:33:27]
C: We'll get back in the same position. Again pass
     on to them that all four explosive bolts have
     fired and it's basically the three of the ...
     resting on it. ATDA adapter - four little pyro
     wires on the adapter that are holding the whole
     thing.

[00:04:33:42]
CC: Okay. We're having LOS.

[00:04:33:44]
_extra : TEXAS
C: The springs have just about extended full force.

[00:04:35:53]
CC: Gemini IX, Houston.

[00:04:35:55]
C: Hello, Houston. Gemini IX.

[00:04:35:57]
_page : 63
CC: Reading you loud and clear.

[00:04:35:59]
C: Roger. I'm out here about 20 feet from it and I
     guess you got the word that all four explosive
     bolts did fire.The back separation devices have
     separated from the ATDA, just hanging loosely on
     it. It's the four small pyro wires that go to the
     strap bolts that are holding it together. The two -
     the strap bolts have fired.

[00:04:36:21]
CC: Roger. Understand, and the wire bundle disconnects -
     can you see anything about those?

[00:04:36:32]
C: No. They're buried in there too much, Nell.I
     can't see it.

[00:04:36:36]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[00:04:36:37]
C: The clamshells at the adapter are between 4 to 5
     inches apart. Those little coil springs, one of
     them is kind of deployed; the other one is still
     attached. The basic nose cone has detached from
     the ATDA ring. The only thing holding it together
     are those four wires that go - that went to the
     initiation on the explosive bolts of the strap.

[00:04:36:57]
CC: Understand. Can you - you cannot tell whether the
     disconnects have pulled? Is that correct? The
     wire bundle disconnects?

[00:04:37:08]
C: That's affirmative. What's holding it together are
     the four small plugs that should have quick-disconnects
     on the pyros on the strap. The whole
     thing is just loosely hanging on there. We're
     standing by for an Unrigidized Sequencing. If you
     can give it right now, it would be great.

[00:04:37:26]
CC: Roger. We'll have to wait until we get over Texas.

[00:04:37:30]
C: Okay.

[00:04:37:33]
CC: Oh, wait a minute! It will be about 6 minutes from
     now when we're over - when we get in Canaveral
     acquisition.

[00:04:37:40]
C: Okay. We're standing by to get movies when you
     Unrigidize.

[00:04:37:49]
_page : 64
CC: Okay. I've got a maneuver message for you for a
     Radial Sep when you're ready to copy.

[00:04:37:54]
C: Roger. Radial Sep. Do you want us to stand by
     here and talk this thing over for a minute and see
     if we can't possibly - I'd like to look at the idea
     of possibly extending the docking bar and going up
     and tapping it and maybe the whole thing may fall
     apart.

[00:04:38:10]
CC: Okay. We've got about 23 minutes left to Radial
     Sep. I'd like to give you that dope first.

[00:04:38:20]
P: Go. Go ahead, Neil.

[00:04:38:22]
CC: Okay. GET B is 04 01 00 Delta-V, 20.0; burn time,
     35 seconds; pitch it 90 down; Address 25, zeros;
     Address 26, 90200; 27, zero; forward thrusters; Up
     Maneuver.

[00:04:38:55]
P: This is Gemini IX. Say Delta-V - and Addresses
     25, 6 and 7 again, please.

[00:04:39:03]
CC: Roger. 25 is all zeros; 26, 90200; and 27, zero.
     That Delta-V is 20 feet per second.

[00:04:39:18]
P: Roger. We got it. GET B is 05 01 00 Delta-V,
     20; 25-second burn time; 25, all zeros; 26 is
     90200; 27 is zero and forward thrusters, Up.

[00:04:39:34]
CC: Roger. ... that perhaps the cables hadn't pulled
     the disconnects to the wire bundles, in which case
     we would definitely have to wait until - with the
     Contingency Plan B - wait until later to look at
     that. We will go ahead and exercise that ATDA as
     soon as we get acquisition at the Cape. Your
     Platform Alinement prior to this SEP will be here
     about 5 minutes from now, so you've got that much
     time to see what you like.

[00:04:40:07]
C: Okay. Okay, Neil.From here it looks like it's
     possible that the wire bundles could have separated
     but it's real hard to see. Again, has everybody
     squared away what's holding the thing together?

[00:04:40:24]
CC: Well, I think everybody down here is pretty well
     convinced by your description of the situation.

[00:04:40:31]
_page : 65
C: Okay. I can't really tell whether - whether this -
     we have two big umbilicals that go to the ATDA. I
     can't tell whether those are still attached or not,
     but it's the four little wires that go into each
     end of the explosive bolts on the strap that's
     supposed to have a disconnect on it, and those are
     all intact. All four explosive bolts are fired
     so it's just the little disconnect umbilicals on
     the strap that have not pulled. All four of them
     are still intact. And all four should have pulled.

[00:04:41:02]
CC: Roger. We're with you, Tom.

[00:04:41:39]
P: Houston, Gemini IX.

[00:04:41:41]
CC: Go ahead.

[00:04:41:43]
CC: This is Houston. Go ahead.

[00:04:41:45]
P: Roger. On the Rendezvous - we initiated with 27
     forward, 1 up - which was not quite Closed-Loop.
     The computer then, however, did function properly
     to give us our proper corrections and it appears
     that it is working all right on all modes at the
     present time.

[00:04:42:08]
CC: All right. Houston copied.

[00:04:42:15]
CC: Did you send the L-Band Command, Gene?

[00:04:42:40]
CC: Gemini IX, Houston.

[00:04:42:44]
P: Go ahead, Houston.

[00:04:42:46]
CC: Did you send that L-Band Command?

[00:04:42:49]
P: We did send an L-Band Command. The ACQ lights
     are off.

[00:04:42:52]
CC: Roger. Understand. And can you tell us the status
     of your START COMP light when you're in CATCH-UP?

[00:04:43:07]
P: START COMP light is working fine.Everything
     appears to be normal.

[00:04:43:16]
P: It was just a little anxious to Rendezvous I
     guess. After we once accepted its solution, things
     went real well.

[00:04:43:22]
_page : 66
CC: Okay.

[00:04:43:25]
C: And we still have about 57 percent fuel.

[00:04:43:28]
CC: Good.

[00:04:43:40]
C: We'll stay here and get in a good position anytime
     that - -

[00:04:43:45]
CC: Okay. And then - how long will it take you to get
     in a position for Platform Aline as soon as this
     is over?

[00:04:43:51]
C: Not too long.

[00:04:43:54]
CC: Okay. We're going to be running out of - of alinement
     time here.

[00:04:44:12]
CC: Your ... will probably be in about 5 minutes or so,
     so we'll have probably a little shorter alinement
     time. We'll be okay.

[00:04:44:22]
C: Okay. I'm getting into position now.

[00:04:44:24]
CC: Roger.

[00:04:44:37]
C: Neil, have you gotten any reading on my suggestion
     about extending the docking bar and giving it a
     tap?

[00:04:44:43]
CC: Well, we're pretty convinced, due to telemetry
     signals from the cables, that they are still
     plugged in.

[00:04:44:51]
C: Okay. Well, it's barely - it looks like it's
     barely - that's right, the big cables may still
     be there, but once that strap goes, the whole thing
     should deploy.

[00:04:45:03]
CC: Right. Are you ready to watch for - we're ready
     to send the commands now.

[00:04:45:07]
C: Okay. Stand by.

[00:04:45:09]
CC: Let us know as soon as you're ready.

[00:04:45:10]
C: Okay.

CC: Roger.

[00:04:45:47]
CC: Okay. Rigidizing now.

[00:04:45:50]
C: It's moving - it's moving all around.

[00:04:45:55]
P: When you Rigidized the clamshell, the alligator
     jaws came closed slightly.

[00:04:45:59]
CC: Roger.

[00:04:46:32]
CC: Okay. Unrigidizing.

[00:04:46:34]
C: The whole mess rotates about 15 degrees on it.

[00:04:46:36]
CC: Okay. That's a pretty good signal then. We'll
     plan to go ahead with Separation Burn at this
     point.

[00:04:46:42]
C: Okay, Neil.

[00:04:46:44]
C: I'm in position to start the Aline.

[00:04:47:04]
CC: Okay. You've got about 14 minutes until Separation
     Burn so - guide your Platform Aline in positioning
     accordingly.

[00:04:47:11]
C: Roger.

[00:04:50:03]
CC: Gemini IX, Houston. We're going to be evaluating
     the shroud situation during the EVA preparation
     period. How does it look as far as being able to
     make that Separation time?

[00:04:50:13]
C: We're working on it. I think we'll hack it, Neil.

[00:04:50:16]
CC: Okay. Let us know.

[00:04:50:37]
C: Houston, Gemini IX. We've finished Alining the
     Platform and we're moving around in position.

     lights now and the L-Band on.

[00:05:02:15]
CC: Say again.

[00:05:02:23]
CC: Gemini IX, RKV. Would you say again, please?

[00:05:02:25]
C: Would you make sure that the ACQ lights are
     commanded ON?

[00:05:02:28]
CC: Roger. We just turned them ON.

[00:05:02:43]
P: RKV, Gemini IX. All residuals are zero.

[00:05:02:47]
CC: Roger. Very good.

[00:05:02:49]
C: And the fuel remaining is 50 percent.

[00:05:02:56]
_page : 69
CC: This is the Cape. Could you give us an evaluation
     of the range in which you can see the ACQ
     lights when you were making initial Rendezvous,
     and also how effective you thought the ACQ lights
     were?

[00:05:03:09]
C: Roger. We saw them for the first time right after
     docking for quite a time. Then we lost them in
     the sunlight. It was for about 30 miles. It might
     have been closer. As soon as we went in the darkness
     we saw them and then we lost them occasionally.

[00:05:03:27]
CC: Okay.

[00:05:03:29]
C: And we saw the cabin-reflected burn light at about
     5 or 6 miles, and we saw the RED running light at
     a good 4 to 5 miles.

[00:05:03:39]
CC: Roger.

[00:05:05:08]
C: RKV, Gemini IX. I now have the ACQ lights on the
     Gemini to outline the history of duration of roll.

[00:05:05:15]

[00:05:30:55]
P: Boy. That's visual crossing at 30 minutes, as far
     as I'm concerned.

[00:05:30:57]
C: Look at that. It just - you could see it cross the
     horizon. It's just kind of like a gray bulk. See
     the night airglow?

     about 45 minutes. We've got to mark it, don't
     forget.

C: I'm Just trying to get that 12-degree mark.

[00:05:35:59]
P: The yaw is still stuck.

[00:05:36:02]
C: Okay. Just a minute here.

[00:05:36:06]
C: Well, just a minute, Gene.

[00:05:36:08]
C: Okay. ... left for you.

[00:05:36:14]
C: Do you have that flashing duck out there? I don't
     have him at all.

[00:05:36:16]
P: Yes, that's enough.

[00:05:36:20]
C: Let me know in a little bit so I can come back and
     Aline this Platform.

[00:05:36:35]
P: It will be about three or four more minutes. I
     want to get the 6 and the 12-degree marking and
     then we want to get their horizons about - that's
     at 41, and the horizon crosses about 45 on your
     reticle - zero on your reticle. You've got thunder
     down there and lightning.

[00:05:36:50]
C: Yes.

[00:05:37:02]

     and Aline, Tom.

[00:05:38:36]
C: Can you see it?

[00:05:38:38]
P: Yes, I can see it. I don't know - it's pretty
     tough to see it while you're alining though.

[00:05:38:44]
P: But we're aways yet from it, coming up in about 3
     or 4 minutes though.

     lighted earth and arising clouds and it's almost
     impossible to keep track of the target. Waiting
     for the 47 degrees to come up, and the target and
     horizon are superimposed. You almost have to keep
     the target in the sky, keep the horizon just above
     it, and keep inkling up to the angle, but then you
     have no reading of the angle unless you take the
     sextant from your eye and actually read it. It's
     almost impossible to keep track of the target in
     the background.

CC: Okay.

[00:06:20:41]
P: Houston, Gemini IX. Our pitch angle is now about
     54 degrees.

[00:06:20:46]
CC: Houston. Roger.

[00:06:21:06]
C: Okay. One hour and 20 minutes from initiation.
     Pitch angle is about 56 degrees down, taking sextant
     sighting.

[00:06:21:18]
P: Checking corrections.

[00:06:21:30]
P: I'm going to get an angle to the sun's edges.

[00:06:21:49]
P: Okay. We got it?

[00:06:21:52]
C: Yes. She is boresighted.

[00:06:22:11]
P: 27 feet per second. You've got the times? ...
     zero. 80 degrees, 80 degrees and about 2 minutes.
     ... might be able to recover, Tom.

[00:06:22:30]
P: 55 22.

[00:06:22:33]
C: Oh, look at that ...

[00:06:22:35]
P: Right here. Caught you back on a curve.

[00:06:22:40]
C: Good show!

[00:06:22:42]
P: I hope we're not overshooting it.

[00:06:22:45]
P: Okay, Tom. In about another minute we should be
     coming up about 64 degrees. I wanted to get a
     good sextant sighting for Chuck because he wants
     this badly.

[00:06:22:59]
C: What do you think of the sextant there?

[00:06:23:03]
P: Well, it's all right but you've got such limited
     space to work with. It's got limitations more at
     night than it does during the day. If I could
     just make sure I get the horizon on this next one.
     You see, I'm forced way down in the corner of this
     thing and I can barely see the horizon, and like
     this one - I don't know if we'll get this one or
     not, Tom.

[00:06:23:30]
_page : 79
P: If we do, it will be by the hair of our chinny
     chin chin!

[00:06:23:37]
C: Okay. Second correction is two seconds down.
     Stand by. I'll get it here.

[00:06:27:00]
C: MARK.

[00:06:27:01]
P: Okay. Let's go into LOS real quick.

[00:06:27:04]
C: Going into LOS.

[00:06:27:06]
P: Okay. And we're inside and let me get our - -

[00:06:27:09]
C: We should sit here at zero, you might check that.

[00:06:27:11]
P: - - .91 miles. Okay, and we've got 19 feet per
     second and we're ready to check LOS at any time.

[00:06:27:21]
C: Okay. I'm on him.

[00:06:27:22]
P: Got him.

[00:06:27:24]
P: Mark it. You're on him. You're accurate enough
     for LOS?

[00:06:27:28]
C: Yes.

[00:06:27:29]
P: Okay.

[00:06:27:30]
P: 67.9.

[00:06:27:44]
P: Okay. You're at 0.8 of a mile and you're about 19
     feet per second coming up on another LOS.

[00:06:27:52]
P: Are you ready?

[00:06:27:54]
C: Yes.

[00:06:27:55]
P: Mark it.

[00:06:27:56]
_page : 80
C: Yes.

[00:06:27:59]
P: 67.9. That means it's zero, Tom. On a zero, that
     means you want to go up. Let me just check this
     in 30 seconds. 67.9. That means you're here and
     you're at 0.7 of a mile. That means you're on and
     probably want to go up. Okay.

[00:06:28:18]
C: On it.

[00:06:28:19]
P: Stand by in 5 seconds.

[00:06:28:23]
P: Mark it.

[00:06:28:24]
C: Got it.

[00:06:28:30]
P: Okay. Go up the angles - -

[00:06:28:32]
C: Okay. How much?

[00:06:28:33]
P: - - Okay. 7 seconds up.

[00:06:28:37]
C: 32 to 39.

[00:06:28:40]
P: Stand by.

[00:06:28:42]
P: Mark it. Okay. Your range - that last lock correction
     was no good. Bad correction. Okay.
     Coming in at 1/2 mile, Tom. We've got to check
     LOS all the way because you have no stars.

[00:06:28:52]
C: Yes. It's really starting to grow out there.

[00:06:28:57]
P: Okay. You're 19 feet per second. How about LOS?

[00:06:29:01]
C: Good enough. Shoot it.

[00:06:29:03]
P: Okay. Right now.

[00:06:29:07]
C: Another half a mile you can really see him go out
     there to brake it. Optically, you can easily judge
     the half mile.

[00:06:29:13]
P: 3.9 to brake.

[00:06:29:16]
C: Okay. I'd better start knocking it down before
     too long.

[00:06:29:19]
_page : 81
P: Okay. You're inside a half mile. You've got about
     19 feet per second, Tom, and thrust up, up, up.
     Keep going up and let me check range.

[00:06:29:33]
P: Okay. You're inside a half a mile. Better start
     braking.

[00:06:29:37]
C: Okay. Braking it down.

[00:06:29:39]
P: You thrusted up 10 seconds, that was good. You
     got 19 feet per second.

[00:06:29:42]
P: And - I'll probably pull off nine of it.

[00:06:29:49]
P: If I keep going around that - -

[00:06:29:52]
C: We're right in-plane.

[00:06:29:53]
P: - - Okay. But you've still got to go up.

[00:06:29:59]
C: I can see the angry claws right now.

[00:06:30:00]
P: You still have to go up.

[00:06:30:05]
P: Okay. You're 2,000 feet. Okay. Hold it Tom.
     What do you have on there? You've got about 11
     feet per second.

[00:06:30:11]
C: Okay.

[00:06:30:13]
P: You're at 2,000 feet.

[00:06:30:18]
C: Got to go up.

[00:06:30:20]
P: 11 feet per second and 2,000 feet.

[00:06:30:23]
C: You can really ... easy to brake.

[00:06:30:24]
P: Okay.

[00:06:30:27]
C: Right In-Plane.

[00:06:30:30]
P: Okay, but you're 1800 feet. Keep that ball going
     around and you're at 7 feet per second. Real good
     shape: 18OO feet, 7 feet per second.

[00:06:30:44]
C: Okay, I'll--

[00:06:30:46]
_page : 82
P: Watch his - watch this ball now.

[00:06:30:47]
P: - - Optically, I can see him grow. There is no
     trouble about seeing him grow.

[00:06:30:54]
C: I wonder if we knocked that Range-Rate down too
     low.

[00:06:30:57]
P: 7 feet per second.

[00:06:30:59]
P: Okay. Thrust up for 5 seconds, Tom.

[00:06:31:01]
C: Okay. Up. I can see the shroud of the ATDA.

[00:06:31:04]
P: All right.

[00:06:31:07]
P: Mark it.

[00:06:31:09]
C: Okay.

[00:06:31:13]
C: Coming in.

[00:06:31:17]
P: 1500 feet.

[00:06:31:23]
C: Oh, look at it! Beautiful!

[00:06:31:25]
P: 7 feet per second.

[00:06:31:29]
C: You can tell you're growing. Just no trouble at
     all telling you're growing.

[00:06:31:33]
P: That last sextant's reading was down in the bottom
     of the corner; it was almost impossible, and that's
     what happened on that one. Okay, Tom, you're at -
     14OO feet. You've got a good Range-Rate, 7 feet
     per second. You're coming right under him. Your
     angle's very slowly going up - going - you could
     probably thrust up for another 2 seconds. Mark it.
     Stand by.

[00:06:32:00]
P: Mark it.

[00:06:32:01]
C: I don't want to use too much more fuel here.

[00:06:32:02]
P: Okay.

[00:06:32:07]
P: You've got 7 feet per second and you're probably
     coming in at 1200 feet.

[00:06:32:13]
_page : 83
P: Okay. You're inside of 1200 feet.

[00:06:32:18]
P: Boy. I really screwed up on that one, Tom. I'm
     sorry.

[00:06:32:23]
P: We had a good transfer through and good second
     correction. The third correction is what hurt us.

[00:06:32:30]
C: I'd estimate we're about 1000 feet, optically.

[00:06:32:33]
P: Okay. We're 1000 feet exactly.

[00:06:32:34]
C: ...

[00:06:32:35]
P: 960 feet.

[00:06:32:37]
C: I can see it in the reticles.

[00:06:32:38]
P: Okay. She's moving around the ball. You're moving
     in 90 degrees. You're in good shape. You've got
     7 feet per second, 7 feet per second. Okay. You're
     at 800 feet.

[00:06:32:59]
P: 780 feet, Tom, 7 feet per second.

[00:06:33:09]
C: Okay. Run some off.

[00:06:33:16]
P: 660 feet.

[00:06:33:18]
C: Hey, you can see us growing pretty good. There,
     I'll knock a little bit off.

[00:06:33:21]
P: 7 feet per second at 660 feet, and you're going
     around the ball to 90 degrees.

[00:06:33:37]
P: 540 feet.

[00:06:33:42]
P: You've got about 2 to 3-feet-per-second, Tom.

[00:06:33:47]
C: That's just what I want.

[00:06:33:51]
C: Hello, Houston. Gemini IX.

[00:06:33:54]

     good shape, Tom, and you've got 420 feet.

P: 360 feet.

[00:06:34:47]
C: We broke optically and I'd estimate we're about
     200 feet just slowly closing in.

[00:06:34:51]
P: 2 feet per second. You're in good shape. And,
     we're coming around. We'll be heads up, we'll keep

[00:06:36:10]
P: Yes. I should have done better on that one.

[00:06:36:14]
P: If I had ignored that third correction that I used
     with that last sextant reading, we would have -
     we would have probably come right on in, - and it's
     nighttime.

P: Hello. This is Gemini IX transmitting in the blind.
     How do you read?

[00:06:36:30]
CC: Gemini IX, this is RKV. Reading you loud and clear.

[00:06:36:32]
C: Okay. We have completed the optical rendezvous and
     are stationkeeping about 1OO feet from the ATDA and
     closing in.

[00:06:36:40]
CC: Roger.

[00:06:36:45]
C: I have 42 percent fuel remaining.

[00:06:36:47]
CC: Roger. Understand. 42 percent.

[00:06:36:49]
C: Roger.

[00:06:36:51]
CC: Roger. I have some information for you when you're
     ready to copy.

[00:06:36:53]
C: Wait till we get a fuel cell purge here.

     about him, though.

[00:06:37:12]
C: Okay.

P: We're drifting up. If you yaw to the right a little
     bit you'll have him.

_page : 86
P: This is Gemini IX. Go ahead with your update, RKV.

[00:06:37:35]
CC: Roger. First, I have some information for you.
     The people at the Cape and Houston do not believe
     we can get the shroud separated.

[00:06:37:47]
C: Okay.

[00:06:37:48]
CC: - - and so we'll go on with the Sep Maneuver and
     want to advise you to use minimum OAMS during your
     stationkeeping period. If you have on-board readings
     of 40 percent, we'll have enough to - for the
     rest of the Flight Plan.

[00:06:38:04]
C: Roger. We have ...

     Yaw to the right. I can't see it - oh, I guess
     we're - -

[00:06:40:13]
C: RKV. We could turn the ACQ off - the running light
     off, if you want.

[00:06:40:21]
CC: Roger, IX. Want to advise you to start that maneuver
     behind the ATDA.

[00:06:40:27]
C: Roger. We are in a BEF attitude now. We will
     Aline BEF.

[00:06:40:31]
CC: Roger.

[00:06:42:28]
CC: Gemini IX, RKV. Like to have you turn the L-Band
     radar off and turn it on prior to the Sep Maneuver.

[00:06:42:38]
C: L-Band coming off.

[00:06:42:42]
CC: Reason for that is it's getting a little bit warm.
     We've got about 30 seconds till LOS and we'll be
     standing by.

[00:06:42:47]
C: Roger. We're Alining Platform BEF and we'll make
     the Retrograde from that one.

[00:06:42:51]
CC: Roger.

[00:06:46:10]
C: Okay. To continue on the debriefing on the Optical
     Rendezvous, it was very easy to see the size of the
     ATDA, with the nose cone grow at 1 mile. The angle
     subtended in the optical reticle was very good.
     Suggest the most practical way of determining the
     pitch angle is to boresight continually and get
     pitch off the ball or out of the computer, instead
     of using the sextant for the initiation of Q. And
     it was very easy to ascertain when approximately
     1/2 mile angle. We did not brake until we reached
     approximately 2000 feet, at which time we could see
     the angle that the ATDA subtended in the reticle.

[00:06:47:01]

[00:06:57:49]
CC: Roger. Right after TPI.

[00:06:57:54]
C: Roger. Then they faded out as the vehicle rotated.

[00:06:58:01]

[00:08:10:20]
CC: Roger. We're showing on the ground that you still
     have both A pumps on Primary and Secondary Loop.
     Was that to help to cool down or just what was the
     reason?

[00:08:10:31]
C: Affirmative. We still feel warm, that's why we
     are on Pumps 1 and 2. We wanted to leave them on
     a little while till we got cool.

[00:08:10:38]
CC: Roger. Very good.

[00:08:10:41]
CC: Okay. There's been a slight change on this Re-Rendezvous
     because of the problem with ATDA ACQ
     lights. We're considering the Re-Rendezvous with
     an approach from above in daylight. What do you
     think about that?

C: ...

[00:08:11:04]
CC: Say again.

[00:08:11:06]
_page : 95
C: It doesn't make any difference. We can Rendezvous

[00:08:11:11]
CC: Okay. They'd would like to try this type of an
     approach, daylight from above.

[00:08:11:27]
CC: Okay, Gemini IX. We'd also like to get confirmation
     that you have the C-Band in the COMMAND position.

[00:08:31:32]
C: Go, Houston. Gemini IX here.

[00:08:31:34]
CC: Roger, Tom. I have some questions from the Cape
     concerning the shroud.

[00:08:31:41]
_page : 96
C: Go ahead. I guess we're the experts.

[00:08:31:43]
CC: I'm sure you are. I understand the shroud gap at
     the base is about 3 to 4 inches. Is that correct?

[00:08:31:51]
C: Roger. That is affirmative. It's about 3 to 4
     inches wide down at the base. Both of the explosive
     bolts at the base of the shroud, where it
     attaches to the TDA, fired, and you can see the
     little coiled springs in between. One coil spring
     was attached sort of between both of them, and the
     other coil spring wasn't ...

[00:08:32:16]
CC: Roger. Understand. Can you estimate the gap between
     the shroud at the strap and also at the apex?
     Over.

[00:08:32:26]
C: Again there are the small wires hooked to a connection
     ... and bolts.

[00:08:32:39]
CC: IX, Houston.

[00:08:32:50]
CC: Gemini IX, Houston.

[00:08:33:10]
C: ... maximum. When the signal was sent to Unrigidize,
     the control unit moved back and forth
     like it was real loose there. I'd say about 15 to
     20 degrees.

[00:08:33:23]
CC: Roger, Tom. Let me ask you some questions about
     it. Can you estimate the distance between the
     shroud at the strap, and also at the apex? Over.

[00:08:33:32]
C: Say again, please.

[00:08:33:33]
CC: Distance between the shroud halves at the strap
     and at the apex.

[00:08:33:42]
C: Roger. At the strap it's kind of hard to say -
     we have 6 inches or more.

[00:08:33:53]
CC: Yes.

[00:08:33:55]
C: About 6 inches.

[00:08:33:57]
CC: Okay. What about at the apex of it?

[00:08:34:00]
_page : 97
C: At the top of it?

[00:08:34:02]
CC: Affirm.

[00:08:34:04]
C: 2-1/2 feet, maybe 3 feet.

[00:08:34:07]
CC: Okay. Does the strap appear to be tight, or does
     it appear to be loose on it?

[00:08:34:12]
C: It looks like the shroud has extended out to the
     length of those two pyro connectors on each bolt
     and opened the back end about 4 inches. Open it
     up like a couple of jaws and you'll have the total
     configuration. The angle between the two halves
     is a good 20 degrees, maybe in excess of that.

[00:08:34:28]
CC: Okay. Can you tell the length of the spring cartridges?
     Can you see those well enough to tell me
     if they look like they're fully extended?

[00:08:34:39]
C: The spring cartridges just about reached their
     full stroke for the ones we saw at the Cape the
     other day.

[00:08:34:46]
CC: Okay. Understand. Does it look like you can get
     to the lanyard on the pyro wire just inside the
     shroud? Over.

[00:08:34:56]
C: There are four connectors there but from what I
     can see the biggest question in my mind is whether
     the lanyards were ever installed.

[00:08:35:05]
CC: Okay. You think the lanyards are not even there,
     right?

[00:08:35:08]
C: I looked - probably we flew in within a couple of
     feet. That's about as close as I could get in
     position. I'd say the closest we got was about
     2 feet, and I could plainly see the insulation on
     the wiring. It was frayed. You could see the
     connectors where they hooked into the bolts and
     the way it was holding, but I couldn't actually
     see the lanyards on it.

[00:08:35:31]
CC: Okay. I understand. If that thing is open far
     enough, do you think you could get in to pull the
     lanyard on the QD on the umbilical? Over.

[00:08:35:43]
_page : 98
C: Say again.

[00:08:35:44]
CC: Do you think you could pull the lanyard on the
     quick disconnect inside the shroud?

[00:08:35:53]
C: Well, I'll ask Gene to talk to you on that.

[00:08:35:55]
CC: Understand. One last question on the shroud. Has
     it moved in relationship to the TDA? Has it
     shifted fore and aft, or has it rotated any? Over.

[00:08:36:06]
C: Pitched up and down, when it Unrigidized and
     Rigidized - opened and closed a little bit and it
     rotated. The total X-Axis of the shroud pitched
     up and down a little bit, about 15 degrees. The
     jaws opened a little bit.

[00:08:36:23]
CC: Understand. Did you say it did rotate also?

[00:08:36:29]
C: No, not much rotation ... mostly just the total
     shroud ... pitched up and down about 15 degrees.

[00:08:36:37]
CC: Okay. I understand. I think we've talked about
     that shroud long enough. You can ignore this
     locking on the target again at CSQ. Don't bother
     doing that. We're satisfied with the Separation
     ourselves and the S-12 Experimenter wants you to
     listen for the door opening when you activate that
     before the sleep period. Over.

[00:08:36:59]
C: Say again, Dick, on the door.

[00:08:37:02]
CC: When you activate S-12, the Experimenter would
     like to have you listen and see if you can hear
     the door opening.

[00:08:37:11]
C: Roger. Will do that.

[00:08:37:16]
C: Houston, Gemini IX. What are the latest plans for
     EVA in the morning? Are we going to do it with the
     ATDA or without it?

[00:08:37:25]
CC: Tom, we're going to do it with the ATDA and we'll
     do the EVA preparation right after Re-Rendezvous.
     Over.

[00:08:37:34]
C: Roger.

[00:08:37:37]
_page : 99
CC: If we do that Re-Rendezvous in daylight, which we
     would like to do down here, we're going to cut a
     little bit into your EVA preparation, but it still
     should give you about 3 hours and 45 minutes. Over.

[00:08:37:50]
C: Okay. We'll probably be there when you get them.

[00:08:37:54]
CC: Well, don't rush it. We think we'll give you
     plenty of time to do that but it will be after
     the Re-Rendezvous.

[00:08:38:03]
C: How does the fuel budget look down there? It looks
     like we have plenty for using the Delta-H of 7
     miles.

[00:08:38:09]
CC: Yes. We think you're in good shape.

[00:08:38:11]
C: Yes. I think we're in real good shape on the fuel.
     Okay, we're still keeping both Coolant Pumps A and
     B on. We're still a little warm in here.

[00:08:38:25]
CC: Okay. You might as well leave them on until you
     cool down and we'll talk to you about the temperature
     over CSQ.

[00:08:38:35]

CC: Roger. We're going to get a tape dump on you this
     pass. We have a Flight Plan update for you if
     you're ready to copy.

[00:09:13:22]
P: All right, Hawaii. Gemini IX.

[00:09:13:24]
CC: Okay. You probably have part of this. Node 
     07:13:19; Rev 5, 95.3 east; right ascension, 20
     hours 01 minute. S-12: 09:00:00; 01 after all

[00:09:14:49]
P: I got it. Sequence 1 and Sequence 2.

[00:09:14:51]
CC: Roger. And also there is a tropical storm that
     will be 77 miles south of your ground track at an
     elapsed time of 09:21:30, if you happen to be in
     the right attitude to look at it.

[00:09:15:12]
P: Okay. We'll give it a try.

[00:09:15:14]
CC: Okay. You can place your Quantity Read switch
     back to the OFF position.

[00:09:15:25]
CC: Have you had time to get around to that auxiliary
     receptacle yet?

[00:09:15:31]
P: Negative. We haven't.

[00:09:15:32]
CC: Roger.

[00:09:15:37]
P: It operates the camera all right.The problem we
     had was operating the sight. We've done a little
     switching around, but we can't - - we haven't
     really made any good thorough troubleshooting yet.

[00:09:15:49]
CC: Roger. I understand.

[00:09:16:08]
CC: Gemini IX, Hawaii.

[00:09:16:10]
P: Go, Hawaii.

[00:09:16:12]
_page : 103
CC: The camera was what they were really worried about.

[00:09:16:16]
P: Okay. We were pretty worried about the sight
     there for a while but we rigged it up from the
     right receptacle and the camera works okay from
     the left.

[00:09:16:23]
CC: Okay. Very good.

[00:09:20:30]
CC: Gemini IX, Hawaii. We have 30 seconds to LOS and
     are standing by.

C: Roger. We've already got the collector door
     closed.

[00:17:45:48]
CC: Roger.

[00:17:45:51]
CC: And I've got a RT change and some maneuver updates
     when you're ready to copy.

[00:17:46:15]
C: Houston, Gemini IX. We have a Computer Running
     light at 8:26.

[00:17:46:20]
CC: Very good. I'm glad to hear that. And let me
     know when you're ready to copy the R<sub>T</sub> and maneuver
     updates.

[00:17:46:51]
P: Go ahead, Neil.

[00:17:46:52]
CC: Okay. Your R<sub>T</sub> is now - that's Address 54, 74966.
     This is a fairly big change but we've checked it
     out.

[00:17:47:08]
P: Understand. 54 is now 74966.

[00:17:47:12]
CC: Roger. And your elevation angle of depression,
     angle to Aline the Platform, will be minus 9 degrees.

[00:17:47:19]
P: Roger. Understand.

[00:17:47:21]
CC: Okay. And don't forget that you've got to change
     Address 24.

[00:17:47:27]
P: Okay.

[00:17:47:30]
CC: Okay. We're ready for - your Height-Adjust Maneuver.

[00:17:47:42]
P: Okay, shoot.

[00:17:47:43]
CC: Okay. Let me give you the Phase-Adjust first.
     GET B: 18:23:19; Delta-V, 20.0; burn time, 3
     seconds; yaw 0, pitch 0; Address 25, 00020; 26
     and 27, all zeros; aft thrusters; Posigrade. I'll
     go ahead with the Height-Adjust now. GET B is
     19:08:16; Delta-V, 17.0 burn time, 22 seconds;
     yaw 0, pitch 0; Address 25, 00170; Address 26,
     all zero; Address 27, zeros; aft thrusters, Posigrade.
     That's Height-Adjust. Go ahead.

[00:17:48:47]
_page : 105
P: Okay. Now was that two Height-Adjust? Was the
     first one Height-Adjust also?

[00:17:48:51]
CC: First one, Phase-Adjust.

[00:17:48:53]
P: Okay.

[00:17:48:56]
P: Phase-Adjust is at 18 23 18 2 feet per second;
     3-second burn; yaw 0, pitch 0; 25 is 00020; 26
     and 27, all zeros; aft thrusters; Posigrade.

[00:17:49:13]
CC: Roger. That's correct. I've got a node update.

[00:17:49:18]
P: I'd like the GET Burn at Height-Adjust, please.

[00:17:49:22]
CC: Okay. The GET Burn of the Height-Adjust is
     19:08:16.

[00:17:49:33]
P: Got 19 08 1 something.

[00:17:49:36]
CC: That's 19 08 16.

[00:17:49:41]
P: 16, Roger. And I copied the rest to be 17 feet
     per second; 22-second burn; yaw 0, pitch 0; 25,
     00170; 6 and 7, all zeros; aft thrusters, Posigrade.

[00:17:49:53]

[00:17:50:34]
CC: Roger. That's correct. You can do a fuel cell
     purge between now and Canaries, which will be
     about 5 minutes or so from now. And they will
     have a block update on PLA's at Canaries and advise
     that their - they've got a shroud in work.

     are 15-1 and 16-1. Is that correct?

[00:18:01:51]
CC: That's affirmative. Negative on that. The Sep
     Maneuver comes from 15-1 through all the rest.
     15-1 through 20-3. You have a Sep Maneuver with
     all of those.

CC: Yes. You do, too. Astros lost last night to
     Pittsburgh 7 to 2.

[00:19:22:58]
P: How'd the Cubs do?

[00:19:23:01]
CC: Stand by.

[00:19:23:03]
CC: Cubs lost 8 to 6 to Cincinnati.

[00:19:23:08]
P: I'm a double loser.

[00:19:23:10]
CC: You've got to expect a few losses.

[00:19:23:40]
CC: We've just been talking to Dave Scott and Jim
     McDivitt at some length. They've been climbing
     around the shroud out at Douglas for the last few
     hours and they advised the outside is no problem.
     The inside may turn out to be a problem. There's
     quite a few sharp edges and things on the inside,
     cotter keys, and one thing or another.

[00:19:24:06]
C: Roger.

[00:19:24:59]
CC: Did you happen to just punch START COMP or change
     modes or something in the computer?

[00:19:25:05]
C: Yes. I checked out my load at 25, 6 and 7.

[00:19:25:09]
CC: Okay. Big Brother's watching down here.

[00:19:25:13]
C: Roger, Neil. Looks like our computer has cleared
     up completely. It was only about the first day
     after you know ... when we ran into this problem,
     and late yesterday evening everything looked real
     good.

[00:19:25:25]
CC: Okay, Tom. It looks all okay on the ground to us,
     too.

[00:19:25:29]
_page : 114
C: Okay. I don't know what the glitch was.

[00:19:25:32]
C: Also, we changed cords and I had Gene's utility
     cord, so I've got my camera in the optical sight
     going okay over here.

[00:19:25:40]
CC: Roger. I understand.

[00:19:26:01]
CC: Do you have - you don't have the radar on yet, do
     you?

[00:19:26:06]
C: No, I don't. You want me to turn it on?

[00:19:26:08]
CC: Stand by.

[00:19:26:13]
CC: Yes, we'd like to have you turn it on and see if
     you can get a lock, and maybe you can report a
     range reading over the Canaries and help FIDO a
     little bit here.

[00:19:26:23]
C: Roger. We got it too. Stand by.

[00:19:26:32]
CC: We're not going to have much track after N<sub>SR</sub> to
     help you out with.

[00:19:26:38]
C: Okay.

[00:19:27:27]
CC: Houston's about to have LOS at Antigua.

C: Roger, Houston. We're Alining the Platform and
     approaching N<sub>SR</sub>.

[00:19:40:03]
CC: Okay. It looks like you've got good radar. We
     are willing to turn those lights on for you if
     you think you'd like to have them prior to TPI.
     But it would mean that you'd have to turn them
     off, you'd have to send a Command to turn them
     off, just as soon as you got in daylight. Thought
     you wouldn't need them.

[00:19:40:25]
_page : 116
C: Okay. ... turn them on right at the last minute
     and then we can ... It's getting daylight.

[00:19:40:36]
CC: I didn't copy you there, Tom.

[00:19:40:40]
C: Turned the ACQ lights on at the latest possible
     station and we will turn them off as soon as we
     hit daylight.

[00:19:40:49]
CC: Okay. We'll do that. We'll turn them on at
     Carnarvon. That's at 20 hours and about 12 by
     20 hours and 10 minutes.

C: Houston, Gemini IX.

[00:22:05:08]
CC: Roger. We're reading you loud with a little
     garble. Advise we'd like to look at your stationkeeping
     between here and the States to see what
     your fuel consumption does. Like to have your
     evaluation of how you think you will be able to
     do stationkeeping and EVA preparation at the same
     time.

[00:22:05:32]
C: Okay. We both just finished talking it over.
     Right now we're both pretty well bushed. But I'm
     afraid it would be against my judgement to go ahead
     and do the EVA at this time. We've got about,
     I'd estimate about 16 or 17 percent fuel remaining
     and if we did all the experiments which we have
     planned and everything else, Gene and I talked it
     over, and we think it might be better for both of
     us to knock it off for awhile. Do some experiments
     and try in the morning, unless you have a
     specific plan with the ATDA out here where we can
     do some good with it. I don't see where we can
     gain a whole lot. Over.

[00:22:06:17]
CC: Roger. Tom. I followed that. Probably - we're
     about two minutes to LOS. We'll be talking to
     you here at the States. We have acquisition at
     22:23.

[00:22:06:35]
C: Roger. 22 23. I think we might be able to stretch
     it on fuel with the shortage and do some experiments
     later ... and if we could accomplish some
     specific task I'd say GO. We're also - both of us
     are pretty well beat out at this time.

     postpone the EVA activity until the third day.
     Would you agree with that?

[00:22:22:42]
C: We concur very heartily with that recommendation.

[00:22:22:47]
CC: Roger. Good. The next thing we'd like to do is
     fire up the ATDA A-ring during this stateside
     pass and cycle the rates and the cone. Would you
     be in a position to observe and photograph that
     activity?

[00:22:23:06]
C: Roger. We're headed on the stateside pass and
     I'm in the sunrise right now, Neil. My camera
     is all set up; be able to follow the whole works.

[00:22:23:14]
CC: All right. We'd like to have a word from you
     when you think the lighting will be satisfactory
     and you're in a good position to begin that
     activity.

P: Houston, this is Gemini IX.

[00:22:24:51]
P: Were you able to find out, Neil, whether there is
     anything we could do EVA to the TDA that might
     afford us some docking?

[00:22:24:59]
CC: We've looked into it rather extensively and we had
     some possible action. However, we did not have a
     very high confidence level in this action.

[00:22:25:13]
P: Tom and I discussed this whole thing and I guess
     the real little real-time evaluation of what we
     have done in the past 20 hours or so and what we've
     got to do leads us to believe probably that the
     third day EVA might be better.

[00:22:25:28]

CC: Roger.

[00:23:04:17]
C: This is Gemini IX. Say again.

[00:23:04:24]
CC: Gemini IX, Houston. Understand that was a 3-foot-per-second
     Retrograde Burn. Is that affirmative?

[00:23:04:31]
C: That is affirmative.

[00:23:04:33]
CC: Roger, Tom. Anticipate when we come across the
     States in the next pass that we'll do an Accelerometer
     Bias Check all the way across the States.
     We will take a good look at it. So you can prepare
     for it even before you get there and you can
     let it run all the way across.

[00:23:04:53]
C: Roger. Will do.

C: Roger.

[00:23:56:32]
CC: Roger. Node Ascending Node; Rev 15; 158.6 west.
     And your Flight Plan update for the next couple of

     period starting right now, at your convenience,
     and give you a couple of revolutions of rest and
     we'll pick you up at the end of Rev 17, beginning
     Rev 18 over the States again.

[00:23:57:08]
CC: Roger. Sounds good. What time will that be?

[00:23:57:13]
CC: Roger. We'll pick you at - Hawaii time at the
     end of Rev 17 is 26:52. It will be approximately
     27:10, 27:15.

[00:23:57:27]
C: Sounds real good. We want to get a little snooze
     here and eat some for awhile.

[00:23:57:33]
CC: Okay. While we're watching this Bias Check we'd
     also like to brief you on crossfeeds. We want to
     open the crossfeed now and see if this will balance
     those tanks; we can close the crossfeed at the
     beginning of EVA in the morning and we will not
     have to open it up again. So if we do it now,
     we'll be all set for the rest of the flight.

_page : 141
C: All the ... were done on that last rendezvous. I
     think we learned a whole lot about rendezvous from
     those last two and also from the first one.

[01:00:00:37]
CC: Yes, I think we all did on those.

[01:00:00:41]
C: That was quite a chore. I'll clue you, on that
     last one, everything was going real good. Hope
     we came out okay on it.

[01:00:00:48]
CC: Okay. Real fine. Real glad it happened that way.

[01:00:00:54]
C: But you talk about being busy as a left-handed
     paper-hanger trying to go optically and also IFR,
     that was really a chore!

[01:00:01:00]
CC: Yes, well that's nothing new, is it?

[01:00:01:03]
C: No, just like flying the old ...

[01:00:01:09]
CC: Well, it looked like a pretty good show from down
     here.

[01:00:01:12]
C: Thank you.

[01:00:01:15]
C: Yes. We used our Backup Initiate, which was real
     close to what the Ground's was. The Closed-Loop
     was off a little. We could see this from the
     plots.

[01:00:01:24]
CC: Understand.

[01:00:01:26]
C: This being Closed-Loop would have thrown us in
     the wrong way. Our Delta, Delta-R shows exactly
     what we had instantly, and the ground solution
     was good, and so was our on-board backup. We
     kept a Closed-Loop and used the modified first
     Midcourse. We took the backup - the Closed-Loop
     for the final Midcourse.

[01:00:01:46]
CC: Fine. Sounds good. At least we know how to do
     them now, don't we?

_page : 142
C: Go ahead.

[01:00:02:08]
CC: Tom, just an overall look here. What we're
     looking at this afternoon, after you have a couple
     of revolutions to rest, just pick up some of your
     experiments, D-14 and S-11's. We can update those
     later for you, and we'll update them in REAL-TIME
     for you to do them after your rest period. We're
     trying to get the EVA tomorrow morning as late
     as possible, still maintaining stateside coverage
     so we can give you a good 10-hour rest period tonight
     before EVA Prep.

[01:00:02:44]
C: That sounds real good. Give us a good accurate
     Propellant Quantity from the ground readout. I'm
     showing about 11 percent here.

[01:00:02:51]
CC: Stand by.

[01:00:04:36]
CC: Gemini IX, Houston.

[01:00:04:38]
C: Go ahead.

[01:00:04:39]
CC: Roger. Your On-Board Gage reading agrees with
     our reading within 1 percent, which means you
     have approximately 50 pounds of fuel remaining.

[01:00:04:49]
C: Roger.

[01:04:06:05]
C: Shoot.

[01:04:06:06]
CC: The local folks down here are wondering if you
     had a chance to see much of Australia?

[01:04:06:11]
C: No. Not really. It's been pretty much looking at
     other things - the ATDA on the rendezvous and it's
     been kind of cloudy, too.

[01:04:06:19]
CC: Roger.

C: You had a few thunderstorms around here; we could

[01:04:06:26]
CC: Yes. Tonight was the first time we've had rain
     in about nine months.

[01:04:06:30]
C: Yes. We could see the lightning down there.

[01:04:06:35]
P: Say Bill, how did they get you off your favorite
     boat and into Australia?

[01:04:06:37]
CC: Well, I used to put you guys to bed all the time,
     so now they let me wake you up.

[01:04:40:36]
CC: I have a sequence change to one of your S-11's
     when you're ready to copy.

[01:04:40:40]
C: Okay. Stand by.

[01:04:40:46]
C: Go.

[01:04:40:48]
CC: Roger. The S-11 at 30 46 45 make the Sequence
     01. Over.

[01:04:40:58]
C: Roger. Got it.

[01:04:41:02]
CC: Okay. We've been looking at your water down here
     a little bit. And ECOM tells me that we are
     losing a little bit of nitrogen out of the gas
     pressure of the Fuel Cell Regulation System.
     There is not a problem. Surgeon said you can
     stand to drink a little more of it. You might
     start tapping it a little bit if you'd like.

[01:04:41:25]
C: Okay. We thought we did a pretty good job
     drinking on it. We'll go ahead and concentrate
     on drinking.

[01:04:41:32]
CC: Okay. We'll watch here. I think if you take a
     little over a long period of time it would be the
     best way to do it.

[01:04:41:38]
C: Roger.

[01:04:41:41]
CC: And I've got a G and C status here for you if
     you're interested in all that. We've got down
     here - it looks like as far as the OAMS are
     concerned - fuel remaining is 48 pounds, oxidizer
     remaining is about 78. On-board gage should read
     about 11 percent and usable fuel gives us about
     82 pounds. This is plenty of OAMS for Attitude
     Control for the rest of the flight plan.

[01:04:42:05]
C: Real good.

[01:04:42:08]
CC: On the computer, it seems to us down here that
     it's working normally at this time. Accelerometer
     Bias update was good. It's almost perfect at this
     time. That START COMP problem we had after the
     first rendezvous - during the first rendezvous,
     has not reappeared and we think that problem may
     have been either in the START COMP button or in
     the Electronic Latch Internal of the computer.

[01:04:42:35]
_page : 153
C: Okay. Roger. It hasn't shown up since the first
     day.

[01:04:42:40]
CC: Okay. We do have a procedure for you when you
     load Module 5. We'll play that just at 25, 26 and
     27 and we think we may be able to correct it in
     case it shows up, but we'll brief you on this
     when we load Module 4.

[01:04:42:56]
C: Roger. Module 4. I thought you said 5 at first.

[01:04:43:00]
CC: I think I did but I meant 4.

[01:04:43:02]
C: Roger.

[01:04:43:04]
CC: Okay. All other G and C systems look real good.
     Temperatures, pressures and voltages are all real
     fine.

[01:04:43:10]
C: Okay, Dick. It's still warm here if we do any
     activity. So far we're running both suit fans.

[01:04:43:16]
CC: Okay. Understand. As far as the ECON status is
     concerned, PCM tape recorder has now functioned
     in the Playback mode. What we'll do with that
     thing, we'll just leave it; looks like it's the
     beginning of the tape. We'll leave it off until
     just prior to EVA tomorrow morning. Hope that we
     may be able to get some AMU data on it.

[01:04:43:38]
C: Roger. Real fine. Thank you.

[01:04:43:42]
CC: And your Fuel Cell H<sub>2</sub> Quantity tape sensor looks
     like it is gone. Everything else concerning that
     looks okay. We're going to calculate hydrogen
     quantity from amp hours and keep you posted on
     that one.

[01:04:43:57]
C: Okay. The last we saw of it, Dick, we were real
     good. We were way up over 87 percent this morning.

[01:04:44:03]
CC: Okay. It doesn't look to us like there are any
     leaks. The system integrity looks good and we
     really think it is a sensor in that case. Looks
     like your stacks in the section are storing load
     real well up there.

[01:04:44:17]
_page : 154
C: Right.

[01:04:44:18]
CC: Okay. And coolant loops -- both of them look
     real good and I understand you are on both A
     pumps at this time to keep a little cool.

[01:04:44:25]
C: That's affirmative.

[01:04:44:27]

     around inside the cabin.

[01:20:57:14]
CC: Another thing we'd like to have you do, when you
     get a chance, is close the S-12 doors.

CC: Go ahead.

[01:23:22:54]
P: ... Part of your PRIMARY or SECONDARY ACME BIAS.
     When I'm in PLAT, I'm 0, 0, 0 degrees now, and to
     Aline the Platform, I steer to the yaw needles,
     but I have to steer away to be away from the roll
     and pitch needles. To get the Platform to 0, 0, 0
     is like being in the 180 N<sub>SR</sub> brake. Know which way
     the needles go?

[01:23:23:17]
CC: Roger.

[01:23:23:19]
P: My yaw needle brings the Platform right in, or I
     have to move the pitch needles up. I have to pitch
     down to bring it in, or when the roll needle is to
     the right I have to roll left. Looks like the logic
     is reversed on the roll and pitch.

[01:23:23:32]
CC: Okay. Stand by.

[01:23:24:26]
CC: Are you in ACME SECONDARY logic?

[01:23:24:28]

     power. SECONDARY ACME BIAS power gives the same
     results.

[01:23:24:39]
_page : 186
P: Now, I'll go to SECONDARY ACME logic.

[01:23:24:58]
P: Okay. SECONDARY logic, pitch gives the same as
     PRIMARY. The pitch needle is fly away ... when
     you're 0, 0, 0 degrees.

[01:23:25:22]
P: The roll is the same. Whether in PRIMARY or SECONDARY
     ACME logic makes no difference. The yaw
     and pitch and probably the roll and pitch needles
     are fly away ... at 0, 0, 0 degrees.

[01:23:25:34]
CC: Roger.

[01:23:25:39]
P: It gave me PLAT and suddenly spun me up to about,

     to 1/2 psi.

[02:01:19:28]

[02:01:20:18]
C: We've got 7 minutes to go to sunrise, so leave the 
     sun visor down.

[02:01:20:24]
P: Okay. I can't because it's wedged but I'll get it 
     down as soon as I open the hatch.

[02:01:20:27]
C: Sunrise unlock the hatch, push the Spacecraft
     hatch so it's unlocked. We're at 1/4 psi pressure
     reading ... We've got about 6 minutes to go to
     sunup.

[02:01:20:41]

     the way?

[02:01:20:43]
P: Get what out of the way?

[02:01:20:45]
C: Get the hatch opening out of the way. Do you want
     to stay there awhile? Can you see?

[02:01:20:53]
P: The only way I can see - as soon as I see the sun's
     rays coming over, Tom - well although we're using
     water ...

[02:01:21:13]
C: ... see bottom line.

C: If we see anything that looks bad we'll go ahead
     and stop it.

[02:01:21:53]
CC: Okay.

[02:01:21:54]
P: Okay. Everything looks good. Why don't we go
     ahead and pop it?

[02:01:21:56]
C: Okay. Go ahead. I'm holding this down.

[02:01:22:01]
P: Okay. We're opening the hatch now.

[02:01:22:02]
C: Roger. Stroke Number 1 and I'm going to hold it

C: Okay.

[02:01:22:52]
C: Hatches coming open.

[02:01:22:54]
P: Hatches open.

[02:01:22:55]
C: All right. We have good ship-to-suit pressure,
     Gene.

[02:01:22:59]
P: Suit pressure looks like about 4, Tom.

[02:01:23:01]
C: I'm holding a good 3-1/2, Gene.

[02:01:23:03]
P: Okay. It's still a little dark out, isn't it?

[02:01:23:04]
C: Yes, it's kind of dark out there. All right, I'm
     going to do something there, then start the check
     list.

[02:01:23:13]
P: Okay.

[02:01:23:15]
C: Gain and Drive selectors to LOCK position.

[02:01:23:18]
P: The lock and the handle are stowed.

[02:01:23:19]
C: Roger. We're on the first page ...

[02:01:23:25]
P: Okay. Let me shove the hatch further up, Tom.

[02:01:23:26]
C: Okay. Now to throw the hatch a quarter ...

[02:01:23:30]
P: Well - -

[02:01:23:34]
C: Wait a minute. It feels kind of stiff here,
     doesn't it?

[02:01:23:36]
P: - - Yes. Yes, a little bit.

[02:01:23:37]
C: It sure does.

[02:01:23:39]
P: It's pretty dark out here.

[02:01:23:40]
C: I can't even see the light in front of you, Gene.

[02:01:23:42]
_page : 195
P: All right.

[02:01:23:44]
C: Now it looks like it's getting daylight.

[02:01:23:51]
P: Man, the hatch is stiff!

[02:01:23:52]
C: Is it stiff?

[02:01:23:56]
C: As soon as the MAC thermal people make their latest
     calculations, we'll have a solution. How are you
     doing?

[02:01:24:03]
P: Yes. Standing in the seat now.

[02:01:24:06]
C: Okay. I've got the garbage bag for you if you're
     ready to heave it out.

[02:01:24:11]
P: Yes.

[02:01:24:12]
P: You better give it to me here, Tom.

[02:01:24:13]
C: Okay.

[02:01:24:18]
P: What? My heel caught on something?

[02:01:24:19]
C: It's caught on the seat.

[02:01:24:20]
P: That's all right. I'm all right now.

[02:01:24:23]
C: Okay. Here comes the garbage bag.

[02:01:24:25]
C: 3 feet-per-second Retrograde. Okay?

[02:01:24:40]

C: Okay.

[02:01:24:44]
P: But I can't turn around fast enough.

[02:01:24:46]
C: Okay. Don't try. Let's go ahead with the next
     step.

[02:01:24:49]
P: Okay. Afraid to see how these hatches work for
     us.

[02:01:24:51]
C: Okay. How do they feel to you, Gene?

[02:01:24:52]
P: I have to see how the handrails are.

[02:01:24:56]
P: Well, it's hard to grab hold, but they'll be all
     right, I guess.

[02:01:25:01]
C: You're kind of rocking the boat. The Plat mode is
     taking care of the situation, so we're okay.

[02:01:25:06]
P: Well, I might try installing - the handrail in the
     back is out and it's a little dark, but I may be
     able to get this one.

[02:01:25:15]
C: Yes.

[02:01:25:18]
P: I got that one, she's out.

[02:01:25:23]
C: Got him?

[02:01:25:24]
C: Don't worry about it.

[02:01:25:25]
C: Put the visor down when you're ready.

[02:01:25:26]
P: Yes. Suit pressure - -

[02:01:25:27]
C: How's your suit pressure, Gene?

[02:01:25:28]
P: - - I can't see it, it's too dark out.

[02:01:25:29]
C: Don't worry about it, Gene. Mine's holding 3-1/2.

[02:01:25:35]
C: That's great. Just pull your EV visor down with
     the pressure getting right out there.

[02:01:25:37]
P: Okay. My visor is down now, Tom.

[02:01:25:39]
_page : 197
C: Okay. I'm going to push up on Spacecraft ...
     there, we've got that.

[02:01:25:43]
C: Okay. Position the Gain and Drive selectors to
     LOCK. Roger.

[02:01:25:49]
P: I checked the Gain selector.

[02:01:25:51]
C: Both Gain selectors to lock, Gene.

[02:01:25:54]
P: Okay. I'll check again but I already put them
     there, Tom.

[02:01:25:56]
C: Okay. Final check on all systems, all Spacecraft
     systems.

[02:01:26:03]
P: Stand by. Wait a minute, let me check these.
     They're locked and they're GO.

[02:01:26:08]
C: Real good. Can you stand on your feet?

[02:01:26:11]
P: Yes, and I want to float out.

[02:01:26:14]
C: We've got the left-hand aft foot well pouch jettisoned.
     Next thing is our little experiment
     called S-12.

[02:01:26:20]
P: It's a little bit dark yet, Tom. Let me see.

[02:01:26:23]
C: Well, just stand out there and look at the sunrise,
     Gene. It looks pretty from here.

[02:01:26:30]
P: It looks like I'm holding about 3.9 right now.

[02:01:26:32]
C: Okay. I'm holding 3.5 in my suit and - -

[02:01:26:35]
P: Yes, and I'm ... slow and very comfortable.

[02:01:26:37]
C: - - Real good show!

[02:01:26:39]
C: I'm going to pump up the ECS O<sub>2</sub> to make sure you've
     got a good go at 700.

[02:01:26:47]
P: Okay. I'm turning around. Will try to get S-12
     now, Tom.

[02:01:26:49]
C: Okay. We'll retrieve S-12.

C: That sun is bright!

[02:01:26:59]
P: I guess it is.

[02:01:27:06]
P: Pull my leg down, Tom.

[02:01:27:07]
C: Which leg?

[02:01:27:08]
P: That one. Yes. Okay.

[02:01:27:10]
P: If I get on the instrument panel, I keep from
     coming out.

[02:01:27:11]
C: Okay.

[02:01:27:13]
P: Okay. Suit pressure seems to be holding at 4.

[02:01:27:15]
C: Okay.

[02:01:27:18]
P: Everything else is pretty nominal right now.

[02:01:27:20]
C: My suit pressure is 3.6.

[02:01:27:23]
C: I feel real good.

[02:01:27:32]
C: It feels good to have the computer running again.
     1 minute after sunrise.

[02:01:27:39]
P: Okay. The S-12 lanyard's gone.

[02:01:27:44]

P: Oh.

[02:01:27:52]
C: Hang on to that ...

[02:01:27:54]

P: Okay.

C: Among other things.

[02:01:28:08]
P: Yes, join the club.

[02:01:28:09]
C: Yes, how about that!

[02:01:28:11]
C: Okay. We've got them.

[02:01:28:13]
C: Check O<sub>2</sub> pressure. You've got to build it up
     when you can.

[02:01:28:15]
C: Deploy the handrails?

[02:01:28:17]
C: Got those?

[02:01:28:18]
P: Handrail is deployed.

[02:01:28:20]
C: Position cutters.

[02:01:28:22]
P: Okay. Come on there, you cutters.

[02:01:28:23]
C: Got them?

[02:01:28:27]
C: ...

[02:01:28:31]
P: Seven.

[02:01:28:32]
P: Okay. I'm trying to get them now, Tom.

[02:01:28:33]
C: All right.

[02:01:28:46]
P: That's a long way back to that handrail.

[02:01:28:47]
C: Is it?

[02:01:28:48]
P: Yes.

[02:01:29:06]
C: Want to hold your foot here, Gene?

[02:01:29:08]
_page : 200
P: Yes. You'd better hold me so I don't leave you.

[02:01:29:11]
C: I've got you now.

[02:01:29:15]
C: Hanging on, Gene.

[02:01:29:18]
P: Okay.

[02:01:29:25]
C: ...

[02:01:29:27]
P: No. It's pretty much of a bear to get at these
     things because the handrail is so far back.

[02:01:29:29]
C: Roger.

[02:01:29:30]
P: But I think I can reach it.

[02:01:29:35]
C: What do you see back there? Any hoses off the
     back end?

[02:01:29:37]
P: What?

[02:01:29:49]
P: I think the cutters will stay.

[02:01:29:51]
C: Okay.

[02:01:29:54]
C: Okay. We'll install the 16mm EV camera now.

[02:01:29:55]
P: Pull me back down.

[02:01:29:56]
C: I'll pull you down. Here you come in. Coming
     down.

[02:01:29:59]
P: Okay. Pull me down some more.

[02:01:30:01]
C: Coming down. Keep your legs together.

[02:01:30:03]
P: Okay.

C: Come back here!

[02:01:30:05]
P: Okay.

[02:01:30:08]

P: I don't see anything waving off the adapter from
     here.

[02:01:30:20]
C: Good show. I've got you down in the seat now, Gene.

[02:01:30:30]
P: Got to move my Hasselblad around a little bit.

[02:01:30:31]
C: Okay.

[02:01:30:35]
P: Okay. Let me tighten these devils.

[02:01:30:37]
C: Got it?

[02:01:30:39]
P: Okay.

[02:01:30:40]
C: I'm holding you down here.

[02:01:30:42]
P: Got the camera. Now let me check the settings
     again, Tom.

[02:01:30:44]
C: Okay.

[02:01:30:45]
P: Six frames per second, 1/2OOth of a second.

[02:01:30:49]
C: That's right.

[02:01:30:51]
P: And f 16. Right?

[02:01:30:56]
P: It's a strange world out here, you know it?

[02:01:30:57]
C: Yes. The stuff looks like the frame of a Ford
     except ...

[02:01:31:18]
P: Come back here, camera!

[02:01:31:19]
C: Got it?

[02:01:31:20]
P: Yes.

[02:01:31:21]
C: How are you doing?

[02:01:31:22]
P: I had it in but it wouldn't snap down.

[02:01:31:23]
C: Okay. Try it again.

[02:01:31:41]
_page : 202
P: Pull me down, Tom.

[02:01:31:42]
C: What?

[02:01:31:43]
P: Pull me down. Whoops! Okay.

[02:01:31:56]
P: I don't understand that. Let me see.

[02:01:32:01]
C: I've got your leg.

[02:01:32:03]
P: Okay. Hold on to me a second.

[02:01:32:25]
P: Well, that was a hard fit but it's in.

[02:01:32:26]
C: It's in?

[02:01:32:27]
C: Good show, Gene.

[02:01:32:29]
P: Okay, Tom, let me turn around before I float out.

[02:01:32:30]
C: Let me help, Gene.

[02:01:32:31]
P: Pull that leg down.

[02:01:32:32]
C9: I've got this leg coming down.

[02:01:32:34]
C: There we go.

[02:01:32:37]
C: How's the EV Hasselblad on the ELSS?

[02:01:32:39]
P: I'm all right.

[02:01:32:41]
P: Medium flow and I've still got 3.9.

[02:01:32:44]
C: Okay.

[02:01:32:46]
P: How does the shrouding look to you now on this - -

[02:01:32:49]
C: It looks good.

[02:01:32:50]
P: - - this camera.

[02:01:32:51]
C: It looks pretty good. I'm ready to let you out.
     The next thing is to attach the Hasselblad to the
     ELSS chest pack.

[02:01:32:56]
_page : 203
P: Okay.

[02:01:32:57]
C: Put the lanyard and Velcro on.

[02:01:33:06]
P: Hey, and while I'm standing here, Tom, let me at
     least get a picture.

[02:01:33:10]
C: All right.

[02:01:33:13]
P: We'll find out how easy it is to be able to take
     pictures with this thing.

[02:01:33:15]
C: You're the highest photographer in the world, right?

[02:01:33:20]
P: (Laughter) Not the highest paid, the highest.

[02:01:33:22]
C: Not the highest paid, but the highest photographer.
     I guess that's something ...

[02:01:33:27]
P: Man, is that beautiful!

[02:01:33:29]
C: Yes, it looks good, doesn't it?

[02:01:33:30]
P: Oh, boy, Tom!

[02:01:33:31]
C: Okay. We're running pretty good on our Flight
     Plan, now,

[02:01:33:39]
C: Okay. The next big item is to take the umbilical
     out of the bag and feed it out. Then move back
     to the docking bar, Gene.

[02:01:33:46]
_extra : CALIFORNIA
P: Okay.

[02:01:33:48]
_page : 204
CC: Look, fellows, about - you broke the docking bar?

[02:01:33:52]
P: Neil, get back to work on the thrusters.

[02:01:33:53]
C: Let me know when you start back toward the aft
     thrusters and I'll shut off the control power.

[02:01:33:56]
P: Okay. Let me take a breather, Tom.

[02:01:33:57]
C: Okay. Take it easy and relax.

[02:01:34:01]
P: Boy, everything wants to ride up. The ELSS wants
     to ride up in my face. Everything I let go of
     goes up.

[02:01:34:11]
P: Let me get these Velcro pads on.

[02:01:34:12]
C: Okay.

[02:01:34:13]
CC: Houston standing by.

[02:01:34:14]
P: Affirmed.

[02:01:34:15]
CC: Okay.

[02:01:34:37]
C: Those look real sneaky.

[02:01:34:39]
P: Say Dick, if you're listening and I know you are,
     boy, you've got a beauty coming.

[02:01:34:49]
C: Houston, Gemini IX. How do you read me?

[02:01:34:54]
CC: We read you loud and clear, Tom.

[02:01:34:56]
C: Don't you read me okay on VOX, Neil?

[02:01:34:59]
CC: Roger. You're clipping a little bit, Tom, but
     we're getting most of it.

[02:01:35:00]
C: Okay. We've got the EVA camera put up and we're
     taking a break here to relax.

[02:01:35:04]
C: Gene's taking a couple of pictures, standing on the
     seat. We'll be going on with the Flight Plan shortly.

[02:01:35:06]
_page : 205
CC: Okay.

[02:01:35:11]
CC: Very good.

[02:01:35:13]
P: Okay. I'm relaxed for a second, Tom.

[02:01:35:15]
C: While I'm having the break, I think I'll relax and
     have a cup of coffee.

[02:01:35:19]
CC: Okay.

[02:01:35:21]
P: On the next pass, we'll talk to you and George
     (George Low, NASA official). I'm sure you don't
     want to talk now.

[02:01:35:27]
P: What part of California are we going to come up on,
     do they know?

[02:01:35:30]
C: Neil, it looks like we're going to be coming up on
     Baja California. That's about right on the track ...

[02:01:35:41]
CC: Yes. That's right, Tom.

[02:01:35:46]
C: Okay. Gene feels real good in ELSS now.

[02:01:35:49]
C: The temperatures are good; our suit pressures are
     holding real good.

[02:01:35:54]
CC: Houston. Roger.

[02:01:35:56]
C: Okay.

[02:01:36:11]
P: About 2 more minutes, Tom.

[02:01:36:16]
C: Okay. You want to pass me a belt around? Is that
     what our next step is?

[02:01:36:18]
P: Okay. I'm going to see if I can get out of here,
     Tom and -

[02:01:36:20]
P: I passed it up.

[02:01:36:22]
C: Okay. I'll help guide your feet out, Gene, and
     I'll start taking some pretty pictures. Don't
     back off the Scanner Heater circuit breaker,
     whatever you do.

[02:01:36:36]
_page : 206
C: Ease on out there, Gene. Here we go.

[02:01:36:38]
P: Whew! We're coming right over LA, I think.

[02:01:36:40]
C: ...

[02:01:36:42]
P: I can see Edwards - I can see the Islands.

[02:01:36:43]
P: I want to go up. I've got to give myself a shove
     forward.

[02:01:36:46]
P: I saw Edwards. That's a pretty lakeside.

[02:01:36:51]
C: See the F-4 near the runway?

[02:01:36:52]
P: Yes.

[02:01:36:54]
C: That was a little thing the Air Force built.

[02:01:37:05]
P: Okay. Can you keep a bearing in there or what?

[02:01:37:09]
P: I'm keeping the bearing as closely as I can.

[02:01:37:11]
p: Okay.

[02:01:37:14]
P: Can you get it?

[02:01:37:26]
P: We're south of LA. There's Baja California.

[02:01:37:31]
C: Yes. Look out for ... Lake ...

[02:01:37:36]
C: Okay. Can you pull that in anymore?

[02:01:37:40]
P: Okay.

[02:01:37:43]
P: That's about it, Pete, for today.

[02:01:37:44]
CC: ...

[02:01:37:45]
C: I can't, you've got some ...

[02:01:37:48]
P: Taking a picture of Baja right here.

[02:01:37:49]
C: Okay.

[02:01:38:09]
C: Say, is that terrific! Gene's taking a picture of
     Baja California, looking ...

CC: Houston. Roger.

[02:01:38:21]

[02:01:38:23]
C: Yes. Even out here.

[02:01:38:27]
P: Okay.

[02:01:38:29]
C: Right on the nose. Roger.

[02:01:38:33]
P: Okay. Wait a minute.

[02:01:38:35]
C: Take it a little bit slower ...

[02:01:38:44]
C: Pressure holding good?

[02:01:38:46]
P: Yes, mine's holding good.

[02:01:38:49]
C: No possible leak?

[02:01:38:52]
P: Okay. You better give the camera now.

[02:01:38:55]
C: Wait a minute here; I'll switch it.

[02:01:39:07]
P: That space is rolling along out here.

[02:01:39:09]
C: Yes.

[02:01:39:11]
C: 12 minutes, 30 seconds...

[02:01:39:19]
P: Okay. I'm going to see if I can get out of
     here, Tom.

[02:01:39:21]
C: Okay. I'll - almost good.

[02:01:39:36]
C: Good enough for a day.

[02:01:39:42]
_extra : TEXAS
P: If I'm going to go out, I got to get myself pushed
     forward.

[02:01:39:55]
P: I can't get there unless I come down a little bit.

[02:01:39:56]
C: You want to come back in and let me help you with
     this?

[02:01:39:57]
_page : 208
P: Yes.

[02:01:39:59]
C: Give me your foot.

[02:01:40:06]
P: Okay. Let it go now.

[02:01:40:08]
C: You've really changed the moment of inertia of
     the Spacecraft.

[02:01:40:10]
P: Okay. Let it go, Tom.

[02:01:40:13]
C: Don't let it suck you away.

[02:01:40:20]
C: It looks pretty out there, Gene. It surely wants
     to float up though.

[02:01:40:25]
P: Yes.

[02:01:40:30]
C: Now we've got the docking bar mirror. Looks Like
     you're upside down and have all kinds of snake
     around you.

[02:01:40:39]
P: Hello, there! If I can get over here, I'll take
     a picture, Tom.

[02:01:40:44]
C: Okay. I don't know how long you can hold out
     there; you want to float up right away.

[02:01:40:46]
P: Yes. Boy, it's really hard to get any torquing
     with one hand!

[02:01:40:49]
C: Yes, I can see that.

[02:01:40:51]
C: If you let go, you're going to fly right off that
     thing.

[02:01:40:54]
C: Hold it ... with the Spacecraft Plat mode ...

[02:01:41:01]
P: If I can ever get hold of it with my other hand.

[02:01:41:06]
C: Yes. Okay. Let me get some pictures of the ...
     tube.

[02:01:41:10]
C: Smile.

[02:01:41:25]

P: I'd like you to smile.

[02:01:41:31]
C: Okay, I'll smile. I've got a picture. I'll get
     back in and we'll press right on with the Flight
     Plans. I've got another of you.

[02:01:41:44]
C: Okay. Mark 15 minutes and 10 seconds after going
     out there.

[02:01:41:49]
P: Okay, Tom.

[02:01:41:51]
C: All right.

[02:01:41:54]
P: I'm going to pitch off here to the left.

[02:01:41:58]
C: Okay. Come on over to the left.

[02:01:42:03]
P: To my left over here?

[02:01:42:04]
C: To your left.

[02:01:42:06]
P: Okay. I'll come to your left. It doesn't make
     any difference.

[02:01:42:07]
C: Come on down there so I can help you down ...

[02:01:42:10]
C: Let me know if you get down near those thrusters.

[02:01:42:13]
P: I don't know where I'm going right now, so hold on.

[02:01:42:15]
P: Yes. I'm getting there, Tom.

[02:01:42:17]
C: Well, let me know when you get on the adapter.
     Maybe you ought to bang on it now.

[02:01:42:22]
C: Let me know to shut it off. Shut them off?

[02:01:42:25]
P: Yes. I'm all right.

[02:01:42:26]
C: Okay.

[02:01:42:27]
P: Okay. I've got the snake all over me.

[02:01:42:30]
C: You've got what?

[02:01:42:31]
P: Snake all over me.

[02:01:42:36]
P: Have you got this other camera on?

[02:01:42:37]
_page : 210
C: I've got the EVA camera on. You're looking good
     all right.

[02:01:42:42]
P: Okay. If I can push off, I'm going to try to get
     out here where I can evaluate this umbilical.

[02:01:42:46]
C: Okay. Go ahead. (Laughter)

[02:01:42:53]
P: I can't get my feet in the right place to push off.

[02:01:43:06]
P: There goes your dump.

[02:01:43:07]
C: That's all right.

[02:01:43:08]
P: Okay, Tom. Here I go.

[02:01:43:10]
C: Okay. There you go, Gene. Real good.

[02:01:43:15]
P: I got caught.

[02:01:43:22]
C: Guaymas, IX here. Looks like the umbilical by
     itself is a pretty hard row to hoe.

[02:01:43:30]
C: What do you think, Gene?

[02:01:43:31]
P: Yes, it's not the best.

[02:01:43:34]
C: Okay, Houston. He's right by my left window now
     slowly rotating. I'll take a picture.

[02:01:43:42]
P: I can't get over here, Tom, to get where I want to
     get.

[02:01:43:46]
P: Okay. See if I can get a start and push away.

[02:01:43:49]
C: All right. I'll be all right.

[02:01:43:50]
C: Okay. Go ahead - taking a picture of you.

[02:01:43:54]
C: Okay. 17 minutes and 20 seconds after sunrise.

[02:01:44:06]
P: Okay, Tom. I'm going straight for you.

[02:01:44:08]
C: Okay, I can see you in the darkness while we're
     here and appears ... looking real good. Let me
     know when you get near those thrusters.

[02:01:44:12]
_page : 211
P: Yes. I can see you in the cockpit. I'm overhead;
     you're real good.

[02:01:44:22]
P: Okay. I've just been back towards them, Tom.

[02:01:44:25]
C: Come back in soon as I turn them off.

[02:01:44:30]
P: You better turn them off, I can't - ...

[02:01:44:32]
C: I'm going to take a ... picture through the mirror.

[02:01:44:41]
C: Let me know when you ... I've got to get the thing
     Alined up ...

[02:01:44:56]
P: Okay. I'm out in front now.

[02:01:44:58]
C: I'm going to go to PULSE now.

[02:01:45:06]
P: Okay. I'm going further out in front, Tom.

[02:01:45:08]
C: Okay. It really disturbed the heck out of the
     platform here.

[02:01:45:15]
P: Boy, what a beautiful Spacecraft, Golly!

[02:01:45:18]
C: Okay. I want to get back in Plat mode here.

[02:01:45:22]
P: I'm trying to get out in front here where I can
     get a good evaluation of pod and this umbilical.

[02:01:45:30]
C: Yes, I've got it coming back into 0, 0, 0 degrees.

[02:01:45:32]
P: I'm going to try to get over on your side and
     evaluate those Velcro pads, Tom.

[02:01:45:34]
C: Okay.

[02:01:45:46]
P: Okay. I'm drifting back towards the adapter, Tom.

[02:01:45:49]
C: You are? Okay. I'm in Pulse mode.

[02:01:45:51]
P: Okay.

[02:01:45:58]
C: Let me know when you're near one of those thrusters.

[02:01:46:10]
C: Like my hand, bring ... torch.

[02:01:46:12]
_page : 212
P: Okay. What happened, I started using one of those
     Velcro pads and - I lost it. It came right off my
     hands.

[02:01:46:20]
P: Well, I'm right outside your window.

[02:01:46:32]
C: I'm going to PULSE.

[02:01:46:34]
P: Say again?

[02:01:46:37]
C: Going to PULSE.

[02:01:46:39]
P: Well, I can for a little bit but I want to evaluate
     these hand pads if I can.

[02:01:46:49]
P: Okay. Now I'm stuck on this thing with a hand pad
     right now but they won't stay. The Velcro's not
     strong enough here.

[02:01:46:54]
C: Velcro won't hack it, right?

[02:01:46:56]
P: Well, not there it won't, unless that nose is burned
     off slightly.

[02:01:47:01]
C: You going back on that adapter again?

[02:01:47:03]
P: Yes. Wait a minute.

[02:01:47:08]
C: I'm going to Plat mode. Where are you?

[02:01:47:13]
P: I'm right on top of your window.

[02:01:47:14]
C: I've got a picture of you.

[02:01:47:18]
C: You'll have to put some torque on the Spacecraft,
     Gene.

[02:01:47:20]
P: The only control I have is the umbilical and, of
     course, the shorter it is, the better control I've
     got.

[02:01:47:26]
C: Yes.

[02:01:47:27]
C: Okay. We've got 20 minutes of sunrise and 30 minutes
     to sunset.

[02:01:47:30]
P: Okay.

[02:01:47:34]
_page : 213
C: Okay. 35 minutes and we'll change that film pack.
     Okay?

[02:01:47:39]
P: Okay, Tom.

[02:01:47:44]
C: ... Looks like ...

[02:01:47:51]
P: Watch it, Tom, I'm coming down. I'm trying to go
     up here now if I can, away from you. Right out in
     here.

[02:01:48:03]
C: I'm going to go back to Plat mode.

[02:01:48:06]
P: Okay. I'm at the end of the umbilical.

[02:01:48:08]
C: Okay.

[02:01:48:10]
P: Man, is it - -

[02:01:48:12]
C: Yes, you look like a real snake out there.

[02:01:48:20]
C: You're going end over end, Gene.

[02:01:48:21]
P: - - Yes.

[02:01:48:44]
P: I want to see what I can do around the nose here.

[02:01:48:46]
C: Okay.

[02:01:49:01]
P: Oh, boy. All I did was twitch my fingers and I
     gave myself a torque that would'nt quit.

[02:01:49:04]
C: ...

[02:01:49:13]
C: Okay. Come on over in front of the window and I
     can get a picture of you. Go on with your evaluation.

[02:01:49:20]
P: Yes.

[02:01:49:27]
P: Boy, the shorter the umbilical, there's obviously
     much better room you've got.

[02:01:49:30]
C: Yes.

[02:01:49:31]
P: When I get back there, I'll try this other hand
     pad, but so far it doesn't look like it's stiff
     enough.

[02:01:49:42]
_page : 214
C: You'd better shorten up on your umbilical there,
     Gene.

[02:01:49:44]
P: Yes. As soon as I find it, Tom.

[02:01:49:46]
C: Okay.

[02:01:49:56]
P: There goes that other hand pad. I couldn't keep
     them on.

[02:01:50:01]
C: Okay. Understand. The Velcro hand pads came right
     off your ...

[02:01:50:03]
P: One - one came right off my hand.

[02:01:50:10]
C: This is really a fine piece of gear. I can see you
     real well.

[02:01:50:15]
P: Okay, Tom. I'll come back to the hatch here for a
     second. What time is it?

[02:01:50:20]
C: Okay. Fine. It's about 24 minutes after sunrise.

[02:01:50:34]
P: It takes a lot longer to get anywhere with this
     umbilical than anyone figured, I'm sure.

[02:01:50:42]
C: Okay. Your foot just kicked my head here. Do you
     want me to help you in the hatch, Gene?

[02:01:50:51]
P: Well, (laughter), I don't have any torque capability.

[02:01:50:56]
C: Let me have your foot with my hand here and I'll
     see what I can do for you.

[02:01:51:01]
P: How's that?

[02:01:51:06]
C: Just kick your foot forward just a little bit.

[02:01:51:10]
C: Come on. Don't kick that dear Heater circuit
     breaker, whatever you do.

[02:01:51:15]
P: Okay. I've got one foot.

[02:01:51:18]
C: Okay. Now you're coming in.

[02:01:51:20]
P: Okay.

[02:01:51:26]
_page : 215
C: Okay, Gene, come on down. Come on down. How are
     you doing there?

[02:01:51:34]
P: I must be under something. Okay.

[02:01:51:39]
C: Pretty good?

[02:01:51:41]
P: It looks like you had a nice lunch. ...

[02:01:51:46]
C: How steady are you now, Gene?

[02:01:51:49]
P: Okay, Tom. I'm going to slow down and take a rest.

[02:01:51:54]
C: Okay.

[02:01:51:58]
C: Houston, Gemini IX. How do you read?

[02:01:52:01]
CC: We still read you, Tom.

[02:01:52:02]
C: Okay. Gene is finished with the umbilical evaluation
     and it looks pretty rubbery out on the adapter.
     When I get back there in the cockpit I can see him
     real well with his docking bar mirror. It's a
     real useful piece of gear. Our suit pressures are
     holding good and we're both real comfortable in the
     suits. We're standing by to ...

[02:01:52:22]
CC: Roger. We've got that.

[02:01:52:38]
P: Boy, this thing really snakes, you know it?

[02:01:52:54]
C: About 6 minutes and 20 seconds to go.

[02:01:53:44]
P: ... time resume ...

[02:01:53:50]
P: Tom, can you read me?

[02:01:53:51]
C: ...

[02:01:54:01]
P: ...

[02:01:54:09]
P: It's still running.

[02:01:54:10]
C: ...

[02:01:54:19]
P: ...

[02:01:54:27]
_page : 216
C: What's that?

[02:01:54:28]
P: ...

[02:01:54:58]
C: Hello at Grand Turk.

[02:01:55:01]
CC: ...

[02:01:55:06]
C: Little warm in spots.

[02:01:55:28]
CC: Gemini IX, Houston. Let's take a check on that
     primary tank pressure now.

[02:01:55:35]
CC: Bump it up.

[02:01:55:46]
P: Pretty fantastic out here, Tom.

[02:01:55:51]
C: ...

[02:01:55:56]
P: ...

[02:01:56:26]
CC: Houston to ... LOS.

[02:01:56:55]
P: Okay. Stay with that, Tom.

[02:01:56:57]
C: ... all squared away for you, Gene.

[02:01:57:00]
P: ...

[02:01:57:28]
CC: LOS Antigua.

[02:01:59:22]
C: Yes.

[02:01:59:28]
C: Okay, okay at 32 minutes.

[02:02:00:32]
C: Let's go over the part about the trip back to the
     adapter. It gave some pretty good torques to the
     Spacecraft, so get back out of the way of the
     thrusters as soon as you can when you get back
     there.

[02:02:00:42]
P: Okay.

[02:02:00:43]
C: I'll have to place it in Pulse mode here.

[02:02:00:46]
P: It may be better because I'll be going back on the
     rails this time.

[02:02:00:54]
_page : 217
C: Okay.

[02:02:01:20]
P: How are we doing on time?

[02:02:01:22]
C: 34 minutes. Do you want to go back to the adapter
     earlier, or just stay here and relax?

[02:02:01:29]
P: Oh, it's probably going to take a little bit more
     time to close the hatch than I thought. The seal
     is still soft.

[02:02:01:37]
C: What?

[02:02:01:38]
P: The seal is still soft.

[02:02:01:39]
C: Yes, it is.

[02:02:01:48]

CC: Gemini IX, Houston standing by over Ascension.

[02:02:01:51]
C: Roger ...

[02:02:02:03]
CC: Okay. We're not reading you very well yet.

[02:02:02:06]
C: ...

[02:02:02:08]
CC: Roger.

[02:02:02:18]
CC: Tom, can you see whether the Tape Recorder Power
     circuit breaker is ON or OFF on the right console?

[02:02:02:32]
C: It is ON.

[02:02:02:33]
CC: Okay.

[02:02:02:42]
C: ...

[02:02:02:57]
C: ...

P: ... close the hatch.

[02:02:03:01]
C: ... I don't think so.

[02:02:03:31]
P: Get out here so I can see ...

[02:02:04:19]
P: Pretty close.

[02:02:04:22]
C: ...

[02:02:04:27]
P: Okay. ... out there.

[02:02:04:29]
C: Okay.

[02:02:04:34]

[02:02:04:38]
O: ...

[02:02:04:40]
P: ...

[02:02:04:45]
c: ...

[02:02:05:03]
C: ... hold it back to 20 degrees.

[02:02:05:12]
P: ... all the way, go ahead.

[02:02:05:14]
P: Can you ...?

[02:02:05:16]
C: ...

[02:02:05:21]
P: ...

[02:02:11:11]
P: Let's go real slow, Tom. I have no EV lights back
     here. You'd better turn them on.

[02:02:11:13]
C: You have the lights on?

[02:02:11:14]
P: No.

[02:02:11:15]
C: Want me to turn them on?

[02:02:11:16]
P: Yes.

[02:02:11:17]
C: Good show. Let me get this thing coming around here.

[02:02:11:49]
_page : 219
C: I'm having some trouble on them, Gene. Just a
     minute.

[02:02:11:53]
P: I want the lights and thrusters.

[02:02:11:54]
C: I've got the lights on.

[02:02:11:56]
P: Okay. I've only got one of them on back here. The one light.

[02:02:11:58]
C: One light. Roger.

[02:02:12:10]
P: Okay.

[02:02:12:12]
C: Pull your umbilical to remove slack. You all
     squared sway?

[02:02:12:15]
P: Yes.

[02:02:12:16]
C: Unstow and position mirrors.

[02:02:12:21]
P: Stand by.

[02:02:12:58]
P: Okay, the mirrors are out.

[02:02:13:00]
C: Okay. I bet you have a fantastic view back there,
     Gene.

[02:02:13:03]
P: I don't know. I'm looking the wrong way.

[02:02:13:06]
C: That's right. Okay.

[02:02:13:10]
C: Unstow pen lights and actuate lights; attach Velcro
     to the hand bars.

[02:02:13:36]
P: Yes. Number 1 is working.

[02:02:13:37]
C: Good show!

[02:02:13:44]
P: ... going to try to get around back here.

[02:02:13:46]
C: Is it?

[02:02:13:47]
P: Yes.

[02:02:13:56]
P: And the other one does not work. How's that?

[02:02:13:58]
_page : 220
C: What's this?

[02:02:13:59]
P: The one on each side.

[02:02:14:00]
C: Okay. One pen light doesn't work, one EVA light
     doesn't work.

[02:02:14:10]
C: Okay.

[02:02:14:12]
C: Ready for the next step?

[02:02:14:15]
P: Yes. Let's go slow though.

[02:02:14:17]
C: I'm going back in Plat mode. Stand by for a couple
     of bumps.

[02:02:14:25]
C: Okay. We're back in Plat mode, Gene.

[02:02:14:29]
P: Okay.

[02:02:14:30]
C: Okay?

[02:02:14:32]
C: The next one is Connect black tether jumper hook
     to the AMU tether ring.

[02:02:14:39]
P: Okay. If I can find it.

[02:02:14:41]
C: Right. Understand you are back in the adapter and
     it is very hot.

[02:02:15:58]
P: Yes, it's very, very hot.

[02:02:16:08]
C: Go back to Houston ... burn.

[02:02:16:14]
C: Hello, Houston. Gemini IX.

[02:02:16:20]
C: Houston, Gemini IX.

[02:02:16:36]
P: Yes. We're really cooking back here.

[02:02:16:37]
C: Okay. Just take your time, Gene.

[02:02:16:54]
C: One thing about it, we allocated ourselves plenty
     of time and we're starting to use one of these
     little unknown things like the hatch and all that.

[02:02:17:05]
C: Okay, Gene. Nighttime coming your way shortly.

[02:02:17:08]
_page : 221
P: Okay. I'm going to wait until it gets here.

[02:02:17:14]
C: How do the lights work? As good as we hoped?

[02:02:17:16]
P: It's not dark back here yet.

[02:02:17:22]
P: They're only half as good. Only one is on.

[02:02:17:25]
C: How's that other pen light? You have the pen light
     that's going to help you there?

[02:02:17:29]
P: Yes. I've got one pen light and one EVA light.

[02:02:17:30]
C: Roger.

[02:02:17:31]
P: The umbilical hung up back there, Tom.

[02:02:17:32]
C: It did hang up. Right?

[02:02:17:33]
P: Yes.

[02:02:17:34]
C: But you got it loose?

[02:02:17:35]
P: Yes.

[02:02:17:36]
C: Good show, Gene.

[02:02:18:13]
P: At about 3.9.

[02:02:18:15]
C: Okay. How's the temperature inside the suit, Gene?

[02:02:18:16]
P: Hot and warm on my back.

[02:02:18:17]
C: Hot and warm on your back. I can imagine the sun
     beating down on you.

[02:02:18:38]
P: How much time do we have before sunset?

[02:02:18:40]
C: I can set up and see the sunset in my rear-view
     mirror. I'm up in no time here, Gene.

[02:02:18:48]
P: You are?

[02:02:19:15]
C: Still working on the ... relation to relaxing.

[02:02:19:17]
P: Just relaxing, Tom. I'm ready to start here in a
     minute. What's the next step?

[02:02:19:22]
_page : 222
C: Okay. Unstow tether bag and connect both orange
     AMU tether hooks to ring on umbilical tether.

[02:02:19:32]
P: Okay. Stand by.

[02:02:19:37]
C: Hello, Houston. Gemini IX.

[02:02:19:44]
C: Hello, Houston. Gemini IX.

[02:02:19:49]
CC: Gemini IX, Houston. Standing by. We're reading
     you weak and garbled.

[02:02:19:55]
C: Roger. Gene's in the adapter now. Going through
     Step 7 here, attach the tether bag and he's considerably
     warmer on the back. I believe it is from
     what we anticipated, so we are taking a break here
     until he cools off.

[02:02:20:09]
CC: We can't make you out, Tom.

[02:02:20:12]
C: Roger. I'll have the Tananarive CAP COM Relayer
     contact you.

[02:02:20:34]
_extra : TANANARIVE
C: Okay. Going back to medium flow. Place time at
     54 minutes (EVA time from hatch opening).

[02:02:20:41]
C: Hello, Houston. Gemini IX.

[02:02:20:51]
CC: Houston. Go ahead.

[02:02:20:53]
C: Roger, Houston. Gemini IX. Our ECS O<sub>2</sub> quantity
     is now 47 percent.

[02:02:21:03]
C: Would you recommend that we open the crossfeed
     between the ECS O<sub>2</sub> and the fuel cell O<sub>2</sub>?

[02:02:21:17]
CC: This is Houston. We're not reading you very well
     at all.

[02:02:21:27]
C: How's it going, Gene?

[02:02:21:30]
P: I'm still trying to get these darn hooks, Tom.

[02:02:21:32]
C: Okay.

[02:02:21:47]
_page : 223
P: Let it go in the high flow until I cool off.

[02:02:21:49]
C: Okay.

[02:02:21:58]
C: Houston, Gemini IX. How do you read?

[02:02:22:34]
C: Hello, Houston. Gemini IX. Do you read through
     Tananarive?

[02:02:22:43]
C: Tananarive contact, Gemini IX.

[02:02:22:46]
CC: Gemini IX, Tananarive contact. Go ahead.

[02:02:22:48]
C: Roger. Relay to Houston. Our ECS Quantity - our
     ECS O<sub>2</sub> Quantity is 46 percent. Do they recommend
     that I open the valve, please?

[02:02:22:58]
CC: ECS Quantity 46 percent. Did they recommend that
     you open the crossfeed?

[02:02:23:04]
C: That is affirmative.

[02:02:23:17]
P: These darn hooks, Tom.

[02:02:23:18]
C: What's wrong, Gene?

[02:02:23:19]
P: Can't get the tether back on.

[02:02:23:23]
C: Can't get it out?

[02:02:23:24]
P: Can't get it on.

[02:02:23:31]
C: Is it harder than what we did on the simulator.

[02:02:23:32]
P: Boy!

[02:02:23:34]
C: What's wrong, Gene?

[02:02:23:36]
P: If I can make the hooks, I'll be all right.

[02:02:23:39]
C: Are you getting the hooks attached to your
     umbilical ring?

[02:02:23:41]
P: Yes.

[02:02:24:01]
CC: Gemini IX, Tananarive.

[02:02:24:04]
_page : 224
C: Roger. I heard Houston. The answer is negative.

[02:02:24:05]
CC: Very good.

[02:02:24:10]
C: Okay. You still working on hooking these hooks up?

[02:02:24:12]
P: Yes.

[02:02:24:14]
C: Okay. Just take your time hooking it up.

[02:02:24:16]
C: Here comes the moon up full ahead. A good moon
     shot - -

[02:02:24:17]
CC: Gemini IX, contact Tananarive ... read at 46
     percent ... Is that correct?

[02:02:24:25]
C: Tananarive contact. This is Gemini IX. That is
     affirmative. 46 percent.

[02:02:24:32]
C: Tananarive. Tell them that we have to use considerably
     higher rate to keep the Pilot cool.

[02:02:24:39]
CC: You have to use considerably higher rate to keep
     the Pilot cool. Is that correct?

[02:02:24:44]
C: That's affirmative.

[02:02:25:01]
C: What did you say, Gene?

[02:02:25:03]
P: I've got my hooks on the ring.

[02:02:25:10]
C: Okay, Gene. You got both of them hooked now?

[02:02:25:14]
P: Just one of them.

[02:02:25:25]
C: Yes. You should be starting to cool off, now that
     nighttime is here.

[02:02:25:28]
P: I almost got this other bad one, but I can't get
     it.

[02:02:25:32]
C: What's wrong? It's hard to hook?

[02:02:25:37]
P: The umbilical is flying all over the place and
     the ... Tom.

[02:02:25:51]
C: Okay. Just take your time on it, Gene. Take your
     time.

[02:02:25:58]
_page : 225
C: ... your umbilical to ...

[02:02:26:10]
P: I can't get the tether hooked on this cargo.

[02:02:26:20]
C: Why, are the rings too small?

[02:02:26:22]
P: No. They're just too hard to get at.

[02:02:26:27]
C: Roger. Just take your time. We've got plenty of
     time.

[02:02:26:29]
P: I've got the 125-foot hook on, Tom. I'm tempted to
     leave the other one for awhile.

[02:02:26:31]
C: Okay. Just leave it. Go ahead.

[02:02:26:33]
P: I'm going to leave it.

[02:02:26:34]
C: Go ahead.

[02:02:26:36]
C: Okay. The next item inspect AMU battery cases
     and verify RCS handles in stowed position.

[02:02:26:49]
P: Check.

[02:02:26:53]
P: Okay. Battery cases are GO.

[02:02:26:55]
C: Okay.

[02:02:27:01]
P: RCS handles stowed.

[02:02:27:10]
P: And that one's stowed.

[02:02:27:11]
C: Okay.

[02:02:27:14]
C: Okay. Install attitude controller arm, and verify
     all six positions.

[02:02:27:29]
P: Okay. It's going to be a bad one.

[02:02:27:39]
P: Oh, shucks!

[02:02:27:44]
C: It's worse than under - under simulation.

[02:02:27:46]
P: You can't - can't get two hands in there.

[02:02:27:57]
P: Oh, you bad one.

[02:02:27:59]
_page : 226
C: Get it yet?

[02:02:28:00]
P: No.

[02:02:28:03]
P: In 1 g you float up and your stops just won't quite
     hack it.

[02:02:28:08]
P: I've got to rest a minute.

[02:02:28:09]
C: Okay. Take your time.

[02:02:28:13]
C: If you can't get enough force there to get the
     thing to pull down out of that slot -

[02:02:28:33]
C: Any luck yet, Gene?

[02:02:28:34]
P: No.

[02:02:28:41]
P: Yes. I've got it.

[02:02:28:42]
C: Got it. Good show!

[02:02:28:58]
C: We've got to turn all six positions. You have to
     pull the other one.

[02:02:29:03]
P: Okay. Let's go.

[02:02:29:04]
C: Okay. Let's unstow the translational controller and
     check it at all four positions.

[02:02:29:19]
C: How are you doing, Gene?

[02:02:29:22]
P: Getting there, Tom.

[02:02:29:23]
C: Good.

[02:02:29:39]
C: Still working on the translational controller,

[02:02:29:41]
P: Yes. Coming up to it now.

[02:02:29:49]
C: I can tell you're heated back there. ...

C: Good show,Gene.

[02:02:29:53]
C: Okay.

[02:02:29:54]
P: Wait a minute. It's not all the way down.

[02:02:30:03]
P: Okay.

[02:02:30:08]
C: Okay. ...

[02:02:30:09]
P: Who said this visor wouldn't fog up?

[02:02:30:10]
P: Is it fogging on you?

[02:02:30:11]
P: Yes.

[02:02:30:12]
C: Okay.

[02:02:30:14]
C: Understand visor is fogging. Okay. Next break,
     attach those temperature sensors if you can see
     them.

[02:02:30:24]
C: You're going to have the moon back there in just a
     minute.

[02:02:30:27]
P: Okay. I've got the temperature sensors on. I had
     them both on, and one fell off.

[02:02:30:29]
C: Okay. Attach - unstow and attach to the controller
     arm in the following order: Oxygen hose - -

[02:02:30:40]
P: I've got to take a rest, Tom.

[02:02:30:41]
C: - - Take your time, Gene.

[02:02:30:44]
C: We're not in bad shape at all.

[02:02:30:49]
C: You'll have the moon up in just a minute back there
     and that should be able to help you.

[02:02:30:56]
P: Phew! Okay. Read - what's the first one, oxygen?

[02:02:31:03]
C: Oxygen hose.

[02:02:31:05]
P: I've got plenty of light.

[02:02:31:06]
C: You've got plenty of light.

_page : 228
P: It's the tendency to float up out of these
     stirrups that gets to you.

[02:02:31:10]
C: Okay.

[02:02:31:15]
C: Restraint harness.

[02:02:31:17]
P: Wait a minute.

[02:02:31:22]
P: Here's the oxygen hose. You can't bend down here
     like you can in 1 g.

[02:02:31:29]
C: I'll say. Yes.

[02:02:31:46]
P: I'm working up a good heat load, I'll tell you.

[02:02:31:48]
C: Yes. I can imagine.

[02:02:31:51]
C: I think the worst part is over there, isn't it?

[02:02:31:56]
P: You son-of-a-gun.

[02:02:31:58]
C: What are you working on, the restraint harness?

[02:02:31:59]
P: Yes.

[02:02:32:22]
P: Okay. I've got one side of it. Let me get the
     other side.

[02:02:32:32]
P: The other visor's - visor's fogging up all over
     the place.

[02:02:32:36]
C: Go to HIGH RATE if you have to, Gene.

[02:02:32:38]
P: I am HIGH RATE.

[02:02:33:03]
P: Okay. I've got the other side.

[02:02:33:04]
C: Okay. ... next is electrical umbilical.

[02:02:33:10]
P: I'm really fogging up, Tom.

[02:02:33:11]

[02:02:34:09]
C: Full ...

[02:02:34:14]
C: The gage isn't open yet so let's see what happens.

[02:02:34:18]
C: It's ... open ... now.

[02:02:34:29]
C: Zero ...

[02:02:34:50]
C: Affirmative.

C: ... Gemini has ... of 00 ... the Oxygen valve's
     been reading O<sub>2</sub> ...

[02:02:35:19]
CC: Give them another call, Bill.

[02:02:35:48]
C: Peroxide is still 455. Temperature is good.

[02:02:35:50]
C: How does the oxygen pressure look?

[02:02:35:51]
P: Still opening the valve.

[02:02:36:08]
CC: Carnarvon is standing by.

[02:02:36:10]
P: Okay. It's open.

[02:02:36:11]
C: Roger.

[02:02:36:14]
C: Okay. You've got the Oxygen valve open?

[02:02:36:16]
_page : 230
C: What do you read on oxygen pressure?

[02:02:36:18]
P: Wait till I get back down there.

[02:02:36:34]
P: The oxygen reads about 7,500 and the nitrogen is
     up around 3,000. I can't quite read it.

[02:02:36:40]
C: Okay. So it looks like we we're in good shape then,
     right?

[02:02:36:42]
P: Yes.

[02:02:36:44]
C: Okay. Mode Selector switch to MANUAL and VOX
     switch to VOX.

[02:02:36:46]
P: There, that way?

[02:02:36:48]
C: Okay. Release the nozzle extensions.

[02:02:36:56]
P: Okay. Nozzle extensions are released.

[02:02:36:57]
P: There's Number 1.

[02:02:36:58]
C: Okay.

[02:02:36:59]
P: Boy, is this fogging - this visor's fogging up!

[02:02:37:01]
C: Is it?

[02:02:37:03]
P: Yes. Here's Number 2.

[02:02:37:04]
C: Roger. Okay.

[02:02:37:06]
C: H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. T/M Selector switch is BACKPACK.

[02:02:37:12]
P: BACKPACK.

[02:02:37:15]
C: Okay. Turn left 180 degrees and back into the AMU.

[02:02:37:20]
P: Tom, we've got the Battery switch to GO.

[02:02:37:22]
C: Okay. Main Power switch ON.

[02:02:37:24]
P: Okay. Main Power switch is ON. The lights are ON
     and we've got power.

[02:02:37:32]
C: Okay. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> T/M Selector switch to BACKPACK, right?

[02:02:37:36]
_page : 231
P: That's affirm.

[02:02:37:37]
P: Boy, I'm fogged up. My pressure - my pressure
     reading is fogged up, my visor's fogged up and I'm
     in high-flow.

[02:02:37:43]
C: Okay. Just turn it - can you see at all, Gene?

[02:02:37:46]
P: Yes. I can see.

[02:02:37:47]
C: Okay.Turn around 180 degrees and back in the AMU
     and relax.

[02:02:37:53]
C: Carnarvon, Gemini IX.

[02:02:37:54]
CC: Go ahead, IX.

[02:02:37:56]
C: Okay. He's fogging real bad and we have to use
     high-flow to keep the fogging down to minimum and
     the attitude controller arms and the maneuver controller
     arms presented far more difficulty to us
     in zero g than they did in the simulation. The big
     problem now is his thrust gage is fogged and his
     visor is fogged and we're just taking it easy here.

[02:02:38:20]
CC: Roger.

[02:02:38:22]
C: Okay, Gene. How we doing?

[02:02:38:27]
P: I don't know. I'll let you know.

[02:02:38:34]
P: Well, believe it or not, I think I've gotten
     turned around.

[02:02:38:44]
C: Carnarvon, Gemini IX. If you read, Houston, our
     ECS O<sub>2</sub> Pressure is 42 percent. 42 percent.

[02:02:38:54]
CC: Say again.

[02:02:38:56]
C: Roger. Houston, our ECS Quantity is 42 percent.

[02:02:38:58]
CC: Understand.

[02:02:39:05]
P: Boy!

[02:02:39:07]
C: How are you doing, Gene?

[02:02:39:08]
_page : 232
P: Really fogged up, Tom.

[02:02:39:10]
C: Okay.

[02:02:39:15]
CC: That quantity is right on the money, Tom.

[02:02:39:17]
C: Okay. He has to use higher rate to keep from
     fogging quite a bit.

[02:02:39:29]
C: Okay. Let me know when you're ready to position
     it. Are you in the AMU now, Gene? All squared
     away?

[02:02:39:39]
P: Let me take another look.

[02:02:39:41]
C: How much can you see out of that fogged up visor?

[02:02:39:43]
P: Oh, I can see in spots. I guess I'm in, Tom.

[02:02:39:48]
C: Okay. It says position tether to avoid tangling.
     I don't know whether you can do that or not.

[02:02:39:53]
P: Yes. I did that already.

[02:02:39:56]
C: Okay. ELSS Power circuit breakers coming OPEN,
     Gene.

[02:02:40:03]
C: MARK.

[02:02:40:04]
C: ELSS Power circuit breaker OPEN.

[02:02:40:05]
P: Okay. I guess the light went off. I didn't even
     know whether it was on.

[02:02:40:08]
C: Okay. Verify the availability of AMU electrical
     umbilical and change from Spacecraft to AMU
     electrical systems. Now do you want to hang on
     and get rested before you do that?

[02:02:40:20]
P: How are we doing on time?

[02:02:40:23]
C: We're about 3 minutes behind on a 10-minute
     schedule.

[02:02:40:27]
C: That's right. Just sit there and rest, Gene. You
     just take it easy. If we're going to have any
     trouble with visibility on loosening electrical
     parts, let's just take our time.

[02:02:40:36]
_page : 233
C: I'll leave the decision up to you whether you want
     to change that ... let's take a rest.

[02:02:40:46]
P: Roger. We're at ceiling and laying here sideways.

[02:02:40:48]
C: Yes, I can imagine.

[02:02:40:53]
C: You have it on still in high-flow?

[02:02:40:58]
P: Still reading about 3.9, Tom.

[02:02:41:00]
C: Okay. Good.

[02:02:41:03]
C: How is the suit temperature, pretty hot?

[02:02:41:05]
P: It's warm enough.

[02:02:41:06]
C: Okay.

[02:02:41:08]
P: Remember now, I've only got one tether hook connected;
     that's a 125-footer.

[02:02:41:12]
C: Yes. You're still connected to the umbilical,
     though?

[02:02:41:14]
P: Right.

[02:02:41:20]
C: Carnarvon, Gemini IX.

[02:02:41:22]
C: We had a lot of difficulty hooking up those two -
     those tether hooks and working up a heat load so the
     only one we have hooked up is the 125-footer. It's
     still hooked to the umbilical.

[02:02:41:32]
CC: Carnarvon understands.

[02:02:41:44]
P: I'm just sitting here resting a minute, Tom.

[02:02:41:46]
C: Take your time, Gene.

[02:02:41:48]
C: Is the visor starting to clear?

[02:02:41:50]
P: If I don't breathe.

[02:02:41:56]
P: But I don't recommend that.

[02:02:42:03]
_page : 234
CC: Carnarvon's coming up on LOS, Gemini IX.

[02:02:42:10]
P: Okay, Tom. I'll go ahead and make the electrical
     changeover.

[02:02:42:11]
C: Roger. Carnarvon. We're going to make the
     electrical changeover. He's had a little bit of
     a rest and our ECS O<sub>2</sub> is 41 percent. Relay that
     on to Houston so they can make a recommendation
     to us when we hit Canton.

[02:02:42:24]
CC: We're real happy with that, Tom.

[02:02:42:27]
C: Okay. Real good.

[02:02:42:29]
P: Okay, Tom. Here comes the electrical changeover.

[02:02:42:32]
C: Okay.

C: We'll go back to the electrical umbilical ...

C: Houston, Gemini IX.

CC: Houston is here, Gemini IX. We're reading you
     pretty weak. Go ahead.

CC: Gemini IX, Houston. Go ahead.

C: ... computer ...

[02:02:59:04]
C: Very good.

[02:02:59:13]
C: ...

[02:02:59:19]
C: Hello, Houston. Gemini IX.

[02:02:59:23]
CC: Gemini IX, Hawaii.

[02:02:59:24]
C: Roger, Hawaii. Would you relay to Houston for me?

[02:02:59:27]
CC: Roger. Go ahead.

[02:02:59:29]
C: We had about 4 or 5 times more work than what we
     anticipated and the Pilot's visor is completely
     fogged over, nearly frozen into him. I'm having
     him stay there and just relax. Also, our communications
     are very poor. He has a lot of garble.
     Every transmission I can barely read. Also, the
     attitude controller arm malfunctioned completely.
     If the situation doesn't improve - also, he's having
     trouble getting the restraint harness hooked-up ...
     call it NO-GO on the AMU. We'll stay here and rest
     for awhile. If he gets them pulled up we'll take a
     good look at it. If it does clear up right away,
     we'll go back to the first ... electrical umbilical
     and call it NO-GO on AMU. Over.

[02:03:00:17]
_page : 235
CC: Roger. Copy.

[02:03:00:19]
C: Relay that to Houston.

[02:03:00:20]
CC: Roger.

[02:03:00:30]
C: See if you can get the reading on the umbilical.

[02:03:00:33]
CC: Say again, Gemini IX.

[02:03:00:35]
C: Very good, Hawaii. Go.

[02:03:00:40]
CC: Were you calling, Gemini IX?

[02:03:00:42]
C: I was talking to the Pilot.

[02:03:00:43]
CC: Roger.

[02:03:00:45]
C: The Pilot has already made the electrical connection
     to the AMU.

[02:03:00:54]
CC: Roger. Copy. He has made the electrical connection
     to the AMU.

[02:03:00:58]
C: That's affirmative. That's the only connection he
     has made and he's fogged over completely.

[02:03:01:04]
CC: Roger. I'll relay this to Houston.

[02:03:01:06]
C: When the sun gets back there, also - his communications
     to me are very poor and garbled.

[02:03:01:11]
CC: Roger.

[02:03:01:14]
C: Right now getting ... to the back and hoping for
     less fog.

[02:03:01:18]
_page : 236
CC: Roger.

[02:03:01:37]
C: Gemini IX to Houston. Better check the right-hand
     hatch. It is weak. It's fairly free to move for
     the first couple of degrees.

[02:03:01:50]
CC: Roger. You say the right hand hatch moves freely?

[02:03:01:53]
C: Right. ... of course it moved freely when it became
     nearly closed.

[02:03:02:02]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[02:03:02:05]
C: Okay, Gene. How are you doing?

[02:03:02:09]
C: ... up about 25 degrees.

[02:03:02:28]
P: Okay. ... just let me relax.

[02:03:02:37]
_extra : HAWAII
C: Well, can you see out at all? Can you see out at
     all, Gene? Okay ... be okay. Okay. This is
     your chance ... Okay. You can't get anywhere.
     I'll tell Houston NO-GO. Still fogged up and can't
     get the arm controller unstowed on the ... When
     you can see enough, switch back to the Spacecraft
     electrical umbilical.

[02:03:03:29]
C: Hawaii, Gemini IX.

[02:03:03:31]
CC: Gemini IX, Hawaii.

[02:03:03:32]
C: I'm giving a NO-GO for AMU. Pilot's fogged up
     completely. The AMU transmitter is garbled. I
     can barely read it. The attitude controller arm
     will not unstow to the proper position and I want
     him to switch back to the Spacecraft electrical
     umbilical.

[02:03:03:49]
CC: Okay. We have that.

[02:03:03:52]
C: He had to spend 4 to 5 times more energy than what
     we had ... experience at zero g in the airplane.

[02:03:04:01]
_page : 237
CC: Roger. Understand. And Houston agrees with the
     NO-GO.

[02:03:04:04]
C: Roger.

[02:03:04:12]
C: Roger. We've also been working with one light.
     We have one EVA light good and only one pen light
     good.

[02:03:04:44]
C: Roger. Hawaii. Gene said to pass on that he hated
     to do it but he doesn't have any choice and neither
     do I.

[02:03:04:49]
CC: Roger. We understand.

[02:03:05:18]
C: Let me know when you get ready to switch back to
     the electrical umbilical.

[02:03:05:20]
P: I'm on it now. I'm going to try to get out of this
     thing now, if I can.

[02:03:05:28]
C: Okay.

[02:03:05:33]
P: I'm still fogged up.

[02:03:05:37]
C: Did you read us, Hawaii, on our transmission?

[02:03:05:42]
CC: Roger. We copy.

[02:03:05:44]
C: Roger. He's had a little difficulty getting out
     of the AMU. He's still fogged up. He's ...
     Spacecraft electrical umbilical.

[02:03:05:50]
CC: Roger. We copy.

[02:03:05:59]
P: Okay, Tom. I'm unfogging in the middle a little
     bit. Okay. You better turn off the attitude
     control systems, I guess. I'll try and come around
     the adapter.

[02:03:06:20]
C: Okay. Cannot open it.

[02:03:06:21]
P: I'm facing it, and I cannot get it open.

[02:03:06:24]
C: Cannot get it open. ... Okay. It's a NO-GO. ...

P: Okay. Wait a minute, Tom. I want to try one more
     time.

P: Still about 75 percent fogged.

[02:03:06:43]
C: Okay.

[02:03:06:45]
P: Okay, Tom. I do have the outer ... doors open now.

[02:03:06:49]
C: Well, what do you want to do? Do you want to call
     it quits?

[02:03:06:52]
P: I'm still fogged up. I don't know what I can get
     out of it.

P: ... Get some of this stuff in here and stay in here
     for a minute and see what happens.

[02:03:09:24]
C: Okay. Why don't you just stand there and relax for
     awhile, Gene? Let me know when you get unfogged.

C: Okay. Hated to call it quits with that AMU but we
     had no choice.

[02:03:10:20]
CC: Roger. We concur.

[02:03:10:35]
P: ...

[02:03:10:38]
C: Still fogged?

[02:03:10:39]
P: Still about 50 percent fogged over.

[02:03:10:42]
C: Roger. ...

[02:03:10:43]
P: Did you get this?

[02:03:10:51]
C: What about for the nighttime? ... In case you go
     into a fog we can take you ... if you do we're going
     to cut it off.

[02:03:10:58]
P: How much time do we have to go to nighttime?

[02:03:11:00]
C: We have ...

[02:03:11:03]
P: Okay. I'm either re-fogged or I'm staying fogged
     right now.

[02:03:11:12]
CC: Tom, this is Houston. You might have Gene check
     his emergency bottle pressure when he gets a
     chance.

[02:03:11:19]
C: Roger. We will ... he's on HIGH RATE, Neil, and
     he is still foggy.

[02:03:11:26]
_page : 240
CC: Roger. When he can see well enough to read that
     bottle pressure, we'd like to get an idea what it
     is.

[02:03:11:31]
C: Roger. Will do.

[02:03:11:35]
C: Gene, can you read your emergency... pressure on
     the check?

[02:03:11:40]
P: Yes, about 6800.

[02:03:11:43]
C: Houston. Did you copy? 6800.

[02:03:11:45]
CC: Roger. Very good.

[02:03:11:49]
P: Hey. Looks like there's an airplane in the contrails
     down there.

[02:03:11:53]
C: Could you see real well?

[02:03:11:54]
P: I can see right through my nose but I can't see in
     front of my eyeballs.

[02:03:12:01]
C: We're coming up on LA. I've got the frost-free
     type.

[02:03:12:12]
CC: That's some kind of a first, Tom.

[02:03:12:15]
C: ... I'll have to agree with you.

[02:03:12:19]
P: Hey, Tom, what's that guy doing with the Texas
     driver's license out there on the California
     highway?

[02:03:12:24]
C: Which freeway?

[02:03:12:26]
P: There. That motorcycle.

[02:03:12:28]
C: The Golden Gate Freeway?

[02:03:12:29]
P: Yes.

[02:03:12:34]
C: Okay, Gene. Now much can you see out now?

[02:03:12:36]
P: Okay. My left eye I can see through, and I can
     see over my nose. The whole right side and extreme
     left side are still fogged.

[02:03:12:43]
_page : 241
C: Okay, Houston. He can just see through his nose
     and one little hole in his left eye. And I can
     see in the mirror he's pretty well fogged over to
     about 60 to 70 percent of his visor.

[02:03:12:53]
CC: Roger, Tom. And we're copying Gene pretty good too.

[02:03:12:57]
C: Okay.

[02:03:13:02]
P: I am going to take a little rest, Tom.

[02:03:13:04]
C: Okay. You take a little rest now. In fact, we'll
     be passing right over LA.

[02:03:13:21]
C: Okay, Gene. How about feeling the hatch. Put your
     finger there and feel the hatch ... to see what it's
     like.

[02:03:13:27]
P: ...

[02:03:13:29]
C: Okay, Bill . ...

[02:03:13:33]
CC: Roger, Tom.

[02:03:13:50]
P: ... let me sit here for a minute.

[02:03:13:56]
P: The left side has cleared up pretty well . ...
     pressure gage is 80 percent fogged over. I can
     see it's still reading somewhere around 4 psi.

[02:03:14:51]
P: Hey, Neil. You might tell everyone down there
     that's concerned, that I'm sure sorry about this.

[02:03:14:59]
CC: Houston, Tom. Tell him we're not concerned a bit.

[02:03:15:04]
C: Well, it was the only way we could play it and
     the safest way.

[02:03:15:09]
P: I'd like - while I'm standing here I might brief
     you. The umbilical did hang out, by the way.
     One armrail was deployed, the footrail was deployed,
     the left armrail and the umbilical guard
     were not deployed. They were hung up with the ...
     I was able to get back there without any problem.
     I say it was just hanging loose and I sprung the
     ... loose and the armrail came out and the umbilical
     guard came out, so I was ... away. I had the
     starboard EVA light back there. I had one pen
     light. I think one of the problems was that just
     before sunset I bet my backpack must have gotten
     over 100 degrees because it was really hot. And
     right after it got cold, my visor started fogging
     up and I could do part of the things with the
     fogged visor, but I just couldn't see enough of
     what I was trying to get at when the visor fogged
     completely over.

[02:03:16:11]
_page : 242
CC: Tom, we copy.

[02:03:16:13]
P: And it's still not clear. I guess about 40 percent
     fogged right now on the eye level.

[02:03:16:21]
C: It looks just about clear here. The sun's pretty
     high anyway.

[02:03:16:27]
P: I'd like to ask Houston ... just stand here now.
     My pressure gage is still fogged and it's around
     4 psi.

[02:03:16:36]
C: Okay. One thing, how about getting the docking
     mirror back in.

[02:03:16:42]
P: You want that out of there?

[02:03:16:44]
C: Yes. We want it out of there.

[02:03:16:46]
P: Okay. I'll go up and get it.

[02:03:17:26]
C: You bet.

[02:03:17:37]
P: I'm slipping forward, forward to do it. I am
     coming up on it. ...hold it, please ...

[02:03:19:53]
C: ... phase we've got about 31 minutes left. If
     you've fogged up, I don't want you to try it.

[02:03:20:12]
P: I'm fogging up again and working here in high-flow.

[02:03:20:15]
C: Houston, Gemini IX.

[02:03:20:17]
CC: Houston, Go.

[02:03:20:19]
C: Okay. Just started happening. He started fogging
     up when he went up to retrieve the docking bar.
     I'm going to make the recommendation that we retrieve
     this before sunset.

[02:03:20:28]
_page : 243
CC: Roger. We agree with that, Tom.

[02:03:20:31]
C: Okay. He is still out there taking pictures,
     basically. Except we're having trouble closing
     the hatch and we're going to go ahead and close
     the hatch.

[02:03:20:48]
C: ...

[02:03:20:54]
C: Okay. Come on. (Laughter)

[02:03:20:57]
P: That's what I need - a ballet lesson.

[02:03:20:58]
C: ... no, legs together- legs together...

[02:03:21:09]
P: ...

[02:03:21:29]
CC: How are you doing?

[02:03:21:30]
C: We're doing good, Gene. I've got the ... umbilical
     ... Probably take us to sunset.

[02:03:21:43]
C: Houston, Gemini IX. Give our regrets to Dr. Knapp.
     I see just no other way to play it.

[02:03:21:48]
CC: Roger.

[02:03:21:50]
P: Did you get through?

[02:03:21:51]
C: Yes.

[02:03:22:32]
P: ... forward ...

[02:03:22:37]
C: There you go.

[02:03:22:43]
P: ... Tom. I'm really fogged up. I guess I'm
     getting more fogged up.

[02:03:22:49]
C: Okay, Houston. He continues to get more fogged up
     just from standing here. We may have green glass.

[02:03:22:56]
CC: Roger. We concur.

[02:03:22:58]
P: Okay, Tom. How does it look down there?

[02:03:23:07]
_page : 244
C: Pretty good.

[02:03:23:21]
P: Tom.

[02:03:23:22]
C: I'll see you, Gene.

[02:03:23:25]
P: Okay. There it goes.

[02:03:23:34]
C: Still fogging, right?

[02:03:23:36]
P: Still fogging.

[02:03:23:37]
C: Still fogging on HIGH RATE? 39 percent. Okay.

C: Put your left foot forward.

[02:03:24:01]
P: ...

[02:03:24:04]
C: ...

[02:03:24:11]
CC: Hey, Tom. Did you bring the EVA camera in?

[02:03:24:15]
C: We did, Neil. I've got it in.

[02:03:24:16]
CC: Okay. Good.

[02:03:24:18]
C: You look pretty good.

[02:03:24:28]
P: Boy! Am I tired!

[02:03:24:30]
C: He's starting to fog now, Houston.

[02:03:24:38]
P: ... at about a ...

[02:03:24:55]
P: I'm starting to fog up at eye level. Hey, Houston,
     ... this way. My face towards you.

[02:03:25:19]
P: I don't think I'll make it that way.

[02:03:26:53]
C: Houston. That hatch was harder to close than we
     thought it would.

[02:03:26:56]
CC: Roger. We've got about 5 minutes to Antigua LOS,
     Tom.

[02:03:27:02]
_page : 245
C: ... film ... they let it go.

[02:03:27:33]
C: We are having a very big deal getting this hatch
     closed. I don't think I'd like to do this again,
     would you?

[02:03:27:46]
P: No, I wouldn't.

[02:03:28:45]
C: Let's take a rest before closing the hatch.

[02:03:28:50]
CC: Roger. We got about 3 minutes yet and then there
     will be 8 minutes before you get to RKV.

[02:03:28:56]
C: Roger.

[02:03:29:01]
P: ...

[02:03:30:00]
P: Is that the last one?

P: Message for you.

[02:03:30:23]

P: ... place for it but ...

[02:03:30:39]
C: Don't push it. It's got to be pulled.

[02:03:30:52]
P: ... don't pull anymore.

[02:03:30:53]
C: Whooppee!

[02:03:30:54]
P: Is that it?

[02:03:30:55]
C: Yes, we've got the hatch locked.

[02:03:30:58]
CC: Good, Tom. Glad to hear that. You've got about a
     minute yet and then it's about 4 minutes until RKV.

[02:03:31:05]
P: Let's pressurize this cabin, Tom. Close the valve.

[02:03:31:07]
C: Okay.

[02:03:31:25]
P: I think we got the last one now. Is that it?

[02:03:31:42]

     that the Pilot was completely fogged over.

[02:03:35:46]

[02:03:36:03]

[02:03:36:06]
P: So are we, believe it or not.

[02:03:36:11]
C: I think we've learned a lot. ... learned a lot.

[02:03:36:14]
CC: That's affirm.

[02:03:36:20]
P: I can tell you one thing, Tom - that once I was
     back there, my chances were about 50-50.

[02:03:36:31]
_page : 247
C: More like 70-30.

[02:03:36:44]
P: Back there I couldn't see anything, and the sunlight
     on one side, and visor was so fogged I couldn't see
     anything.

[02:03:37:05]
P: ... I could hear you, but only in spots.

[02:03:37:10]
P: Did you push the audio tone?

[02:03:37:20]

     you, but I could tell you were talking and I didn't
     get anything at all.

P: You might ask Houston whether or not they have any
     more D-14's planned for us. If they do, we'd better
     just take the first one and take a look at it because
     I broke off the antenna.

[02:03:39:08]
CC: Roger.

[02:03:39:29]

P: Or take it off. One or the other. I can't get it
     off.

CC: Gemini IX, RKV. We'll have LOS in about a minute.

[02:03:40:01]

     house here.

[02:04:37:00]
P: It was OPEN.

CC: Okay. We see it on the ground. And we'd like to
     verify the T/M switch in the REAL-TIME and ACQ AID
     positions.

[02:04:37:09]
P: Okay. It's in REAL-TIME and ACQ AID now.

[02:04:37:12]
CC: Roger. Would you go to the EXPERIMENT position on
     the Propellant Indicator switch and give us a read-out
     pressure and temperature on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>?

[02:04:37:21]
P: Okay. It looks like we bang a few switches around
     here, don't we? It's reading 460 right now -
     pressure- and 65 degrees Fahrenheit temperature,
     and our question is probably what you've been
     considering. Do you want us to get rid of it or
     not?

[02:04:37:40]
_page : 250
CC: They'll talk to you over the States about that.

[02:04:37:43]
P: Okay.

[02:04:45:41]
CC: Stand by.

[02:04:45:42]
P: Saw the umbilical guard come over the back of the

[02:04:45:54]
P: Houston, do you read?

[02:04:45:55]
CC: Yes. What we want to know, Gene, is the configuration
     of that AMU as it is now. Right now, as best
     you know it.

[02:04:46:02]
P: Okay. The AMU, as it is now, has the Oxygen valve,
     OPEN, Hydrogen valve, OPEN. On my gage, I have 80
     percent peroxide quantity. The Battery switch is
     ON.

[02:04:46:26]
CC: Okay. How about the arm and the tether?

[02:04:46:37]
C: Houston, Gemini IX. You're coming in broken.

[02:04:46:40]
CC: Roger. We got all that. We'd like to have the
     condition of the arm, the umbilical and the tether -
     the restraint.

[02:04:46:51]
P: Down.

[02:04:46:54]
P: The attitude control arm is up and locked. It's
     in the flyable position. The tether was discarded,
     and it cleared the Spacecraft.

[02:04:47:09]
CC: Roger.

[02:04:47:21]
CC: Say again the position of the left arm.

[02:04:47:26]
P: The left arm is down. Not locked, but all the
     way down.

[02:04:47:31]
CC: Roger. All the way down.

[02:04:47:32]
CC: Now, how about any other electrical or hoses?

[02:04:47:41]
CC: Are they still curved to the pack, or are they
     loose or what?

[02:04:47:46]
P: The tin hose is Velcroed to the - to the arm controller.
     The restraint harness on both sides is
     Velcroed to the arm controller, and the electrical
     connection, I believe, is Velcroed. I think I've
     got it back down but I cannot verify it.

[02:04:48:06]
_page : 253
CC: Roger. We have all that.

[02:04:48:14]
CC: Okay. For your information, the - your on-board
     quantity indicates 20 pounds of fuel. The source
     pressure indicates 28 pounds of fuel. The ground
     equations indicate 35 pounds.

[02:04:48:30]
P: Roger. We've got that. Thank you.

[02:04:48:32]
CC: Okay. And I've got a maneuver update when you're
     ready to copy.

[02:04:48:36]
C: Roger. Houston, we have that. Is that fuel only
     or is that fuel and oxidizer?

[02:04:48:42]
C: Fuel only.

[02:04:48:43]
C: Roger.

[02:04:48:44]
CC: We got a - we'd like to do this Orbit Shaping to get
     your true anomaly in the right place, if you'd agree
     with that.

     we are in good shape. Stand by one and we'll copy
     it.

[02:04:49:15]
CC: Okay. I can tell you first it's going to be a 25-
     foot-per-second burn. We'd like to monitor your -
     have you monitor your VW tank, your reserve tank,
     during the burn, and if it starts to go down, you
     stop your burn at that point.

[02:04:49:34]
_page : 254
C: Shoot for 25 feet per second or if VW tank starts
     down, we'll stop the burn.

     second you burned.

[02:04:50:52]
CC: That is correct and you can turn your crossfeed ON.

[02:04:50:59]
C: Crossfeed coming OPEN.

[02:04:51:09]
CC: Our current approach is not to jettison AMU unless
     we feel for some reason we have to.

[02:04:51:18]
C: Roger. We were going to ask you about that. What
     was your recommendation?

[02:04:51:22]
CC: Well, we're sure going to keep it for awhile. I
     want to watch these pressures and I'm sure you'll
     be watching them too.

[02:04:51:29]
C: Roger.

[02:04:51:32]
C: Bob, we learned a whole lot out of the EVA. It was
     a real worthwhile exercise.

[02:04:51:35]
CC: Yes. We certainly agree with that.

[02:04:51:40]
_page : 255
C: In fact, I wished you would have gotten some ...
     data on the previous one.

[02:04:51:44]
CC: Say again.

[02:04:51:50]
C: I said I'd wished you'd have been able to get this
     data on the previous one.

[02:04:51:52]
CC: Yes. But it looks like you got a lot of the data
     we would've got.

[02:04:51:55]
C: Yes. I think it was still a real fine exercise.
     We hated to give up the AMU portion of it, but we
     did do some good umbilical evaluation and we got
     some pictures. We also got a lot of thermal inputs
     to give back to the people.

[02:04:52:11]
CC: Yes. We can see that it was very valuable. You
     know the EVA bottle is empty.

[02:04:52:19]
P: Thanks a lot.

[02:04:52:20]
C: Thanks a lot, Dick.

     that you could get a light here sometime
     along the way.

C: Roger.

[02:04:54:14]
CC: Looks like, Tom, that we are not planning to
     jettison the AMU, even if that light does come on.
     However, in the configuration you have it - we
     don't see any reason why we won't be able to
     jettison it if, for some reason, we have to.

[02:06:11:23]
CC: Roger, I have a Flight Plan update for you.

[02:06:11:28]
C: Roger. Be ready to copy in 1 minute.

CC: Roger. 54 38 34 through 54 47 28 photographs of
     South America; 70mm Hasselblad, 80mm lens; strip
     chart; weather and film permitting. These should
     be nadir photographs.

[02:06:12:18]
C: Roger.

[02:06:12:21]
CC: 55 30 - stand by. 54 57 00.This is an S-1. Start
     with Milky Way exposures. Take two exposures of each
     of the four horizons starting north, then west,
     south and east. 55:30:00: Load re-entry module
     tape; then power-down except for rate gyros.

[02:06:13:11]
CC: Stand by, Gemini IX.

[02:06:13:24]
CC: Gemini IX, Hawaii. That time for loading the re-entry
     module should be approximately 55:46:37.
     That will be Hawaii acquisition on the next revolution.
     Also, over Hawaii, on the next revolution,
     it's 55:46:18 crew status report. S-11: 56:49:17;
     Sequence 02, southern horizon only. Use Acamar for
     yaw attitude. CSQ: 57:04:02; PLA update. RKV

C: Roger.

[02:06:16:03]
CC: We'd also like for you to think about the weight
     update of the Spacecraft at this time. Such items
     that you have jettisoned and the amount of the O<sub>2</sub>
     and the ELSS and such as this.

[02:06:16:15]
C: Roger. The ELSS has approximately 1 pound of
     oxygen left in it.

[02:06:16:25]
CC: Roger.

[02:06:16:28]
C: And the jettisoned items were estimated to be
     approximately 2 pounds.

[02:06:16:36]
CC: The number of items jettisoned should add up to
     around 2 pounds.

[02:06:16:44]

     and, of course, there was the S-12 steering

[02:06:18:09]
CC: Okay.

[02:06:18:11]
C: Okay. I broke it about two-thirds of the way
     down. I actually broke the casing; it seemed to
     snap - semi-snap back in place. Apparently there
     is a cable or a line through it. It's not spring-loaded
     like the UHF nose antenna. It may or may
     not work. I don't know whether you want to try it.

     northern horizon, western horizon, southern
     horizon and eastern horizon. Two pictures of the
     Milky Way; one of northeast horizon and we have
     taken four pictures - that's a total of 12 and I
     ruined the first shot. Pictures...

[02:07:13:20]

     we will continue drinking until we have 2847 on
     the gage.

[02:07:50:05]
CC: Roger. You have 2764 at this time; you'll continue
     until 2847.

[02:07:50:11]

CC: Roger.

[02:07:50:17]
CC: Have you both been drinking about the same or have
     you - or is one of you thirstier than the other?

[02:07:50:22]
C: Gene has had about three times as much of that
     since EVA.

[02:07:50:28]
CC: About three times as much since EVA?

     know what to do with the second one.

[02:07:50:47]
CC: Roger.

[02:07:51:02]
CC: How do you feel today compared with yesterday,
     when you started to delay the EVA until today -
     as far as tiredness and physical feeling?

[02:07:51:11]
C: Roger. We feel a lot - we feel about twice as
     good. We both had to kind of - little drowsy
     yesterday.

     C    This is a continuation of the debriefing on the
     Rendezvous. One trimming will complete the first
     Rendezvous. Radar was turned on and lock was
     obtained intermittently at 130 miles. It occurred
     at 120 nautical miles. After N<sub>SR</sub> we started to
     make data points throughout TPI. They showed
     that we were fairly ... in our effort ... 12-1/2
     miles.
     P    The altitude -
     P    Altitude ... shows us to be 12-1/2 miles. Our
     Delta, Delta-R held between 47 and 49, .49 negative,
     and this is based on a 50-nautical mile range. Just
     exactly a little over 2-1/2 miles difference, so
     we're probably 200 miles to the ATDA. Apparently
     so. We went into Rendezvous mode, as I recall
     from the charts.
     C       And we noticed a computer problem prior to where
     the START COMP was initiated.
     P       That was just on the last burn after the N<sub>SR</sub> burn 
     and ...
     C       The computer was switched to Rendezvous mode.
     P       After eight data points, we got a solution with the
     computer. Our first solution was expected - but
     then the computer also reacted just as if you had
     pushed START COMP, giving us an unauthorized solution.
     We re-initialized the computer and went
     into the Rendezvous mode. We went down through
     eight data points and picked up another solution,
     at which time the computer and the IVI's gave us
     a solution as did the MDIU and the computer. We
     had selected that as our Open Loop. This happened
     twice in a row.
     P       The number of data points that was required to get
     a Closed Loop solution - and if we switched into
     the Closed Loop at 3:20:05 GET, we would get a
     solution that would - the computer would give us,
     if this START COMP cycle repeated itself, that
     solution would be our TPI Solution based upon -
     going into RENDEZVOUS. We caught this - we were
     in the process of talking about this when ...
     rendezvous 03:20:17 or 12 seconds late. We - what
     am I doing - Okay.
     C       ...
     P       The solution that the computer came up with turned
     out to come right down on the predicted time of
     Point Charlie or Point C, from the charts. However,
     this time was a little bit off. I am not sure how
     this time coincides with the back-up time for TPI
     burn, but the Closed Loop did come up just as predicted
     and with this automatic START COMP function
     it had, the solution was apparently a good solution.
     The time, as far as we are concerned for TPI, however,
     differed with the ground. The computer gave
     us 26 forward, 8 up and 4 right. It differed with
     the ground. The ground gave us 26.7 forward, 1.3
     up, 2.2 right. Backup correction, 24 forward and
     0 up/down. We went with sort of a compromise because
     we did not like the 8 up from the Closed
     Loop at all and we did not have too much confidence
     in the computer.
     P   We went with 27 forward, 1 up and 2 right, which
     was basically a compromise between the ground and
     back-up solution. It looked good to us, which was
     our on-board back-up. Now one thing about the on-board
     and back-up rendezvous information. On both
     this and the other rendezvous, many times we were
     dependent on making corrections based on our radar
     angle and then the elevation angle. Wherever we
     could, we tried to take the two angles to get the
     Delta-Delta-R difference of ..., so as a result,
     we did compromise on this TPI and went with what
     appeared to be the ground solution.
     C   Okay. With respect to the lighting, approaching
     TPI. We first saw a speck of light that could be
     compared with about a fifth or sixth-magnitude
     star and it was in excess of 50 miles. The ATDA
     appeared in the darkness as about a zero-magnitude
     star. Continuing on, we made our first back-up
     solution measurement in 1 to 4 minutes after transfer
     into reflected sunlight, and the ATDA disappeared
     into darkness for approximately 5 minutes,
     so the overall condition from the ground with respect
     to the Phasing and the N<sub>SR</sub> was exactly on
     time.
     P   I might add that the Closed-Loop solution from the
     computer came right on time. The COMP light came
     right on the predicted time of my burn. In other
     words, I predicted back-up burn time accurately
     and my COMP light came on exactly on time. The
     reason we did not like the 8 up on Closed-Loop
     solution was that there was little or no ellipticity
     and it just didn't appear right to us. As it turned
     out, it was a good thing we did not burn it. The
     first correction obviously was initiated as Closed-Loop.
     We decided to see what the Closed-Loop
     was going to give us on its first correction. It
     came up with 2 aft and 3 up as my back-up solution.
     We did get a Closed-Loop solution to go with it.
     Closed-Loop solution was 2 aft, 2 up and 3 left.
     My back-up solution said 3 aft and 4 up. They both
     tended to agree. Whether or not there was a difference
     in this optical sight angle, I don't know,
     but for some reason we did go with the Closed-Loop.
     It looked good to us. It even looked better to
     us than the back-up solution. It looked pretty
     poor to us on the basis of its own correction,
     because we did not burn the 8 up in TPI. On the
     third correction, which is back-up, I got 1 aft
     and 1 up. We burned zero on the fourth correction.
     Our insert correction gave 3 forward, 2 down;
     back-up solution 0 forward and 3 down. We burned,
     in Closed-Loop, 3 forward and 2 down. After that
     point, the corrections, we felt, were very small
     and the back-up solutions agreed with the Closed-Loop.
     We went Closed-Loop and came right up the
     pipe. We had very few LOS problems to control at
     all. They were all within boundaries and we had
     little or no braking problems at 1 mile. As I
     recall, we took off about 20 - which brought us
     down to somewhere around 20 feet a second and all
     the COMP ... must have been ...
     C    Immediately after going into darkness we saw the
     flashing light. The ATDA went into darkness at
     approximately 20 miles ... we immediately saw a
     flashing light. The flashing light stayed on for
     15 seconds and disappeared. After this time, we
     would intermittently see the flashing light. As
     long as certainly 12 miles to 13 miles away, we
     could see a slight red light when there was no
     flashing and, as we progressed on, the ATDA finally
     came in the vicinity of the moon. The maneuver
     for the initial line of sight was held constant
     and was done with the moon, before we made the
     final correction to the right. The sky was lit up
     so brightly by the full moon that very little ...
     background could be seen. The ATDA from approximately
     4 miles was in very brilliantly reflecting
     moonlight. We could see the flashing light and
     the RED, GREEN and AMBER lights at that time.
     There was a final brake at approximately 1/2 mile.
     We could tell that the cone lights were on and,
     as we approached within 1000 feet, everything
     looked in good shape on the ATDA since we could
     see the cone lights and a part of the ATDA. Then,
     as we closed in further, we could see the moonlight
     and extensions on the nose of the ATDA. It became
     very obvious, there in the moonlight, that the nose
     shroud had not jettisoned. The shroud was open
     like a set of jaws, approximately 30 degrees off,
     not ... Braking went very smooth and we had 58
     percent fuel remaining at the end of the first
     run. Equal period orbit initiation at Omega 80
     ... it was determined in real time that ... the
     ATDA was going ... orbit rendezvous. At this time
     we Alined the Platform ... made a good Platform
     Alinement and proceeded directly on top of the
     ATDA ... initial maneuver on time. As we fell
     behind the ATDA, of course, we could see the running
     lights, particularly the RED running lights
     on the ATDA. Approximately 13 miles, pardon me,
     up to approximately 8 miles in darkness ...
     P   The sextant practice that was to occur after
     separation, or 1 mile through 3 miles, was
     attempted but could not be done for a couple of
     reasons. At first we were at too steep an angle to
     acquire the horizon out of the Spacecraft window
     while we were boresighted on the target. In addition,
     seeing a target that was as bright and
     white as the ATDA was, it was impossible to see
     the target against the ground background. We
     discovered that it was very difficult during
     Rendezvous even up to as close, as I recall, a
     mile because we were coming in from above. ...
     so, as a result, none of the sextant practice was
     actually done because I could not acquire the
     target visually at all. I did get a sextant reading
     at 12 degrees to give us a back-up to our
     Horizontal-Adjust Maneuver. Nominal was 41:05,
     our time was 41:22. And then we got a GET of
     local horizon crossing of 45:20 and 45:33 was
     nominal. This gave us a Horizontal-Adjust maneuver
     of .1-foot-per-second forward and .2-foot-per-second
     out, which ended up in time to be 0 forward
     and .5 foot-per-second up. I decided we would not
     burn. Now, regarding Terminal-Phase Initiation,
     we were coming in real well at - Tom.
     C    At this time we continued to track him on radar
     throughout this maneuver ... The ATDA was only 8
     to 9 miles in front of us. It was impossible to
     see. We rolled to keep the sun from us. It became
     brilliantly lit in sunlight and I would
     estimate it was a maximum of about a zero-magnitude
     star at dawn. He grew in intensity all the
     way through the rest of the maneuver. It was very
     easy to see, a short time after sunrise.
     P    I made a slight error at first. I took 47 degrees
     for my second angle instead of 43 degrees. As a
     result, I missed my whole transfer. I looked for
     a second angle first and of course, I missed the
     first angle. I was too late to go back. I didn't
     think it was worthwhile waiting for a sextant angle,
     then I regrouped and took the Delta-Theta that went
     with it, because I thought the delay too long. So
     what I did, I regrouped at that time and I took -
     I computed TPI from Delta-Theta ... I could have
     gotten a sextant reading of 8 degrees very easily.
     We initiated ... TPI slightly late at 114.29 and
     nominal is 112.51. We had to go with this method
     and then, plotting ourselves on the chart, started
     courses that seemed correct. Even though TPI was
     late, I felt that we caught it pretty well. Now
     the first correction, because TPI was late ... I
     again lost the sextant correction - because we'd
     gone past that sextant angle as a result of the
     late TPI - so I computed it again with Delta-Theta,
     from the ball and the time, and got 0 aft and 2
     down. Now I was all prepared on the second correction.
     I got my sextant angle, but the second sextant
     angle was 80 degrees, and an 80 degree angle
     is almost impossible to get in the Spacecraft.
     Cramped far down in the left bottom corner of the
     window, I was not able to pick the horizon out. I
     feel that this correction went very good. I computed
     it with a combination of sextant angles and
     Delta-Theta and came up with the time and a Delta-Theta,
     but the correction was slightly biased or
     ended up to be a bad correction because of the
     last sextant angle. Delta-Theta was good, but
     the 80-degree sextant angle was bad. You just
     didn't have enough room for error up here, whether
     you held perpendicular to the horizon or not, and
     I think this was the difficulty.
     P    I came up with 2 down. I feel this correction
     probably should have been 0 or close to it. ...
     quite a bit of line-of-sight correction in the
     mode prior to braking. Like to talk about the
     lighting and braking, Tom?
     C    Right. After TPI, the reflected sunlight continued
     to increase to a more brilliant light than
     the planets by the time that we were in ... 3
     miles. There was no difficulty in seeing it. I
     used the optical sight out of the window optically
     for all the braking. At 1 mile the nose cone and
     the complete body of the ATDA was the size of the
     total of Agena. I tried braking at approximately
     - well, I would estimate 3/4 of a mile - continued
     in brake and arrived at stationkeeping position
     well before sunset. We made the Rendezvous in the
     inverted position. The terminal phase on up presented
     no difficulty whatsoever.
     P    I personally feel that the reason we were so -
     could so ably see the target in reflected sunlight
     was that big white nose cone. It was silver with
     a dull burnished aluminum, was very dull and burnished
     where that white should have shown out there.
     C    On the Rendezvous from above, we continued it in
     after the N<sub>SR</sub> maneuver.
     P    Closed-Loop solutions for the total velocity ...
     total velocity and we didn't get a repeat of
     START COMP cycle and T<sub>I</sub> and V<sub>T</sub> looked real good.
     Occasionally we'd get one about every fourth or
     fifth solution that came up that would be higher
     than the preceding one, but generally they came
     down in a fairly systematic order. We had a lot
     of faith in our Closed-Loop by the time it came.
     However, we saw ... ellipticity for about - let
     me see ... mile Delta-H. We were about 8 miles
     ... and then we were ... and then we were still
     going. We were still going up when we hit TPI
     and our computer gave out ... the pass over the
     RKV. I'll repeat what I was going to say. We
     noticed an ellipticity ... we were about 1/2 mile
     over our desired 7-1/2 miles. We started out
     about a 1/4 of a mile high and went up to 1/2
     mile high. We then started coming back down and 
     we went through 7-1/2 miles in Delta-Delta ...
     all the way as high as ...
     CC   Ascension, AOS ...
     P    ... a 1/3 of a, 3/10 of a mile, 1/3 of a mile.
     But we got the Closed-Loop ... properly. The
     Closed-Loop gave us 19 forward and & down and
     I'd like to point out ... 1/2 forward and 3/10 up.
     ... in the Closed-Loop gave us 2 left. We didn't
     like the down and at that time we left it ... to
     the ground so there were two things about the
     Closed-Loop we didn't like ... much more logical,
     so we went with 17 forward and 3 up, essentially
     the back-up solution for Terminal Phase Initiate.
     The COMP light came ON at 7:50, time 7:50, and we
     initiated a correction at 8 minutes. I predicted
     it to come on at 7:50, so we're pretty close there.
     Our first correction on back-up data was 0 forward
     and 3 down.
     C    Alined the Platform.
     P    Then we Alined the Platform at that time. Closed-Loop
     or Open-Loop back-up information ... the
     Closed-Loop gave us 4 aft, 1 up and 5 left. We
     burnt 4 aft, 1 up and 3 left. With the Closed-Loop,
     the up looked good on the basis of our
     initial transfer. Here again the computer - although
     we did not - ... the first correction gave
     us 1 up ... both the primary ... computer solutions
     are debatable, I believe. Like to talk, too, about
     our lighting, Tom.
     C    Now.
     C    Prior to transfer, we could see the - target flashing
     light and, suddenly, just before daylight we
     noticed a small light that grew in intensity. It
     was the brightest reflecting target we have ever
     seen. I would estimate that it was 4 to 5 times
     brighter than Sirius, against the earth's surface
     just before sunrise with reflected moonlight on it.
     We had this at 20 miles. As sunrise occurred, the
     lighting changed from moonlight into sunlight and
     the intensity of the target decreased all the way
     through. We finally came out over the desert areas,
     where we lost the target completely.
     P   This is where it became extremely difficult to
     get good angles because we were going from boresight
     to radar and radar to - hey, Tom, I don't
     know exactly! they were not obviously really
     steady and some of our corrections ... but as I
     recall, we did not have visual contact until -
     correction, we were doing line-of-sight control
     and you were radar-boresighted and I think it was
     to a mile before we had it.
     C   During this time we had reflected sunlight from
     the desert and I could not see my pattern on the
     optical reticle. There was no possible way to see
     the target. I tried to adjust the needles, which
     had fluctuated in somewhat of a previously prescribed
     manner. The Range-Rate needle was far in
     excess of nominal and continually fluctuating between
     12 to 15 feet per second. I finally could
     see a faint speck in the distance, 3 to 3-1/2 miles.
     This was not ... by reticle. Finally, as we crossed
     the Red Sea, I could see you coming up on the white
     target, against a blue ocean, but 1 mile was approximately
     the maximum that we could see under this
     condition. And during this time the radar needles
     fluctuated back and forth ... We continued in to
     one-half mile, we got a good Range-Rate and the
     line-of-sight was going good ... Range-Rate to a
     negative value.For this we had to make a 7 to 10-foot-per-second
     positive forward thrust. At this
     time we continued on until we were stationkeeping.
     P   The third correction back-up gave 2 aft and 2 down
     and then we could see rapidly that we were crossing
     angles. The fourth correction gave Closed-Loop:
     2 forward, 10 down and 7 right; 1 aft, 5 down, and
     we burned. Apparently Tom could see errors developing,
     as I recall, from the ball. We burned a total
     of ... We went in on the basis of LOS at that point
     and we had quite a bit of line-of-sight control,
     which worked out fine. We had to force it down
     because our angles were crossing too steeply ...
     come up into the sun as I recall it was happening
     at that time. I think the one thing we ought to
     remember from this Rendezvous ... showed suddenly
     during the equal-period orbit was that when you're
     looking down at daylight with an earth background,
     the target is almost impossible to see.
     C   Also, the motion that you experienced as you are
     down to a vertical position going across the ground
     is something phenomenal. The relative positions,
     even when you can see plainly, are very hard to
     ascertain; as is the job of looking at your Flight
     Director Attitude Indicator, optically tracking and
     also cross-checking your radar.
     P   As the target goes across the ground, it is impossible
     to try to pinpoint it against any terrain,
     looking down. It was just impossible to acquire
     it even after we thought we would. We might add that
     on our third day here today, we turned on our radar
     and got a fairly steady lock-out up through about
     179 miles, at which time we changed our attitudes
     and did not follow it any further.

CC: IX, Houston BLACK FLIGHT says they'll see you back
     at Houston.

[02:10:23:10]
P: This is the EVA debriefing for this afternoon. We
     had about four hours for the EVA preparation, of
     which we took less than three. We thought things
     went very well during the EVA preparation; of
     course, as usual we had the snake in the cabin, but
     we sat here for approximately 45 minutes. We were
     ready to go except for pilot pressurization, check
     out emergency ELSS supply, 45 minutes before sunrise
     and then 25 minutes before sunrise we went ahead and
     did this. We egressed about 10 minutes before sunrise,
     got the hatch fully open. The pilot was actually
     standing in his seat in darkness - still we
     got no sun coming over the horizon at all.

[02:10:24:10]
C: This was approximately a GET of 49 16, 49 hours and
     16 minutes.

[02:10:24:24]
P: And the first thing we did - and the first thing I
     did - I looked around, reached back and saw the
     EV bar extended on the adapter section. I just
     reached over and extended the bar on the retro section.
     I'm sure glad it did because it came in handy
     later.

[02:10:24:53]
C: Experienced some difficulty on that.

[02:10:24:54]
P: The EV camera bracket was very difficult to put in
     the holder. As a matter of fact, I had to get two
     hands on it at one time. Very, very difficult in
     zero g. Then I put on the cutters - I wrapped them
     around the - the IN hole that was out there. That
     was again a little more difficult job than predicted,
     because everything had to be one-handed, and some
     time - because you have to hold on with the other
     hand - because if you don't find some way to hold
     on you are going to drift right out and do a somersault
     right over on top of what you're doing. As
     a matter of fact, I did it a number of times and
     I'm pretty sure that that's what broke the D-14
     antenna. I actually sat on it - laid on it with
     my back but - got the cutters out there and got
     those wrapped around - took the EV Hasselblad and
     put it in on the chest pack, snapped it on. All
     this went fairly smoothly, pretty much the way we
     had planned it. We had the cameras positioned well
     on top of the - Tom had it - or we got the umbilical
     out at that time, and Tom, you had some comments on
     that I guess you might want to read.

[02:10:26:09]
_page : 294
C: Roger. On the umbilical, we had a number of difficulties.
     Also, when you were standing on the
     seat, you had some difficulty in maintaining position.
     I had to help hold your feet down.

[02:10:26:27]
C: When you're working near the Spacecraft, if you did
     not have something directly to grab, your feet would
     float up.

[02:10:26:41]
P: Apparent through the whole EVA period was the fact
     that whenever you float, you float up and if you
     hold on to something, whether it be the docking
     bar, handrail, or what it is, you do not have -
     unless you've got two hands firmly implanted or a
     foot or a hand or something - you do not have enough
     strength in your wrist to overcome the inertia of
     your body floating up. You just can't keep your
     arms that rigid. And you can't get two hands on
     it, generally, if it's the same thing like the
     docking bar or one article because - it's not that
     you can't reach - close your hands in front of you
     - but when you're trying to hold on to something,
     you need to do more than close your hand, you need
     to grab it and strengthen - or straighten out your
     wrist. The combination of the ELSS, plus the difficulty
     in reaching, makes this impossible. I
     think the main problem starts in the cockpit. The
     fact that you start floating up all the time.
     Whenever you're outside, it's always up, you never
     float down. Even with a slight perturbation you
     float for a little bit, and then you - you're on
     your way up again, especially true Tom, on the
     adapter work. The next thing was that he put the
     docking mirror, he handed me the docking mirror,
     and I put it on the docking bar. Of course, the
     first thing is to get to the docking bar and I
     tried to give myself a shove with my feet from the
     hatch and also hold on to the RCS thrusters. Once
     you get your hand in an RCS thruster, you can pull
     yourself forward - it's pretty easy to hit the
     docking bar but until - until you get yourself
     alined fairly well with a thruster in a docking
     bar position, you're just going to float up and
     force yourself down. I got the mirror on and Tom
     seemed to like that real well.

[02:10:28:39]
_page : 295
C: Right. The mirror is a wonderful device for keeping
     track of the person who's outside anytime he's
     not in your field of view. I could see Gene right
     when he was going back to the adapter, when he was
     outside my field of view behind me here - out of
     the field of view of my window.

[02:10:29:00]
P: And then I - I pushed off, attempting to get in
     position first to push off from the Spacecraft.
     I found that holding the umbilical very short, so
     you could position your feet somewhere on the
     Spacecraft, and get yourself a fairly good thrust
     action through the center of gravity. The only
     problem is your feet do not stay on the Spacecraft
     - you can't keep them on the Spacecraft. So I
     pushed off a number of times and a couple of times
     got out to the full extent of the umbilical and,
     here again, you can talk about what is the best
     way to pull in on an umbilical - jerk in or - a
     slow pull. From my short experience today, I
     feel that a slow pull is much, much better. But
     - you can't - even a slow pull is very difficult
     to direct to the center of gravity. So what happens,
     even a slow pull will give your body rotation.
     It's not the rotation that's so bad, but
     it's the fact you you also pull yourself in towards
     the Spacecraft, and the chance of your hitting the
     Spacecraft with your back or your helmet or on the
     side is very very good. Also, when I pulled in
     again, I always floated to the top, never to the
     bottom. Of course, this has something to do, I
     feel, with the umbilical direction, but I think it
     had more of a - more to do with the same general
     tendency that we had here in the Spacecraft to
     float up. Not truly being zero g. Tom, you watched
     some of this, didn't you?

[02:10:30:32]
_page : 296
C: Right. Everytime you'd get out there and start to
     maneuver, you always tended to go straight up -
     float up.

[02:10:30:38]
P: Again, I think this was not so much because of the
     manner in which the umbilical was routed, but because
     of the general tendency to go up. I can't
     stress too much how difficult it is to hold on to
     a single bar such as the docking bar and keep your
     body rigid there partially in the attitude you so
     desire, because it keeps you - all at once the
     Spacecraft floats back up under you, and it takes
     an awful strong wrist if one hand is to hold that
     - to hold your whole body down and rigid, and two
     hands to use ELSS, which is in front of you - it's
     an almost impossible task. I had the Velcro pads
     on my hands, and I got back to the right-hand side
     of the Spacecraft. I started to use them and got
     my left hand in. I started to put my right hand in
     and I got it in there. But when I pulled my left
     hand out, I pulled the Velcro pad right off my
     hand. I didn't clench my fist apparently tight
     enough to hold the Velcro pad to stay there and I
     - my hand came right out. But another thing that's
     very obvious, even with Velcro pads, if you try
     to walk around the surface of the Spacecraft, it
     would take a great deal of strength and wrist action
     to keep your body stiff. I don't think you
     would be able to develop this type of torque with
     the Velcro pads, because again your feet will tend
     to go right on over the top of you because you tend
     to float up. If you, for instance, got on the starboard
     side of the Spacecraft and kept your hands
     in those Velcro pads, you'd probably do a complete
     somersault and stand on your head and might be
     laying on your back across the adapter - just because
     of that tendency again to float up. I guess
     after that I came back to the hatch. It was fairly
     easy to work your way up to the hatch, step by step,
     pulling slowly on the umbilical - just give a slow
     jerk and then reach out and try to grab another
     piece of the umbilical and make a sort of vectorial
     correction to your direction of motion. A very
     slow pull on a short umbilical and you can - you
     can tend to control your attitude somewhat better
     and, of course, make corrections to your translations.
     I got back in the hatch and handed Tom
     the EV camera and he changed the lens and the film
     pack. I guess, Tom, without difficulty, because
     you sure handed it back in a hurry.

[02:10:33:09]
_page : 297
C: Right. There was no difficulty at all, strapped
     in here.

[02:10:33:15]
P: Then I put it back in and the camera again was
     very difficult to get back in the slot. But I
     did get it in and locked. Then I stepped out of
     the hatch. I had to get the umbilical clear, so
     I first held on to the short end of the umbilical
     - maybe about a foot from where it was attached
     to the hatch - and then attempted to close the
     hatch that way. It took quite a bit of effort and
     time to close the hatch because it was very stiff
     in the semi-open and fully-open modes. It was
     very loose in the last one - 8-10 inches of travel
     just before locking. But it took quite a bit of
     work. I got it partially closed and then, as I had
     planned earlier, I was going to work my way back
     to where I could hold on to the handrail on the
     retro adapter and close the hatch that way. I
     finally got it fully closed. Tom pulled a little
     bit from inside and I'm sure at the end much more.
     We finally got it shoved all the way closed and I
     was able to sort of control by body movements -
     one hand being on the hatch, rigid as well as pushing
     on it, and the other hand being on the arm rail.
     Then we got the hatch closed, and I began to work
     my way back to the back of the adapter. While I
     was still in the retro area, Tom cut off the thrusters
     and I told him to blow the EVA bars and he
     did; he said he did, and immediately I knew that
     we had problems there because I did not see the
     umbilical guide come around the adapter.     So I
     continued to work my way back there and, had I
     been able to hold myself rigid enough back there,
     I would have taken a picture, but the only thing
     to hold on to was the adapter handrail and that
     meant holding on out to my left and looking around
     a fairly jagged, but a very clean, adapter separation
     plane. So I didn't get a picture. I could
     see that the foot rail was deployed, the handrail
     on the far side was deployed - which would be the
     bottom of the Spacecraft. The handrail and the
     umbilical guide on my side, or on the top of the
     Spacecraft, were not deployed and the bathtub was
     hung up. I worked myself back around to where I
     could - I was about a third of the way into the
     adapter - and I just took a slight jolt or tug.
     I pulled on the handrail, and it broke the bathtub
     loose. It went sailing back - I gave a fair Delta-P,
     I guess - and the umbilical guard extended very
     slowly, as expected. It didn't give me any problems
     at all. Had I anticipated any when I looked back
     there, I wouldn't have gone in to do it, but I
     could see fairly well what the problem was and I
     knew the handrails extended very slowly. Had it
     been the foot rail, I would have given it a second
     thought. But then I threaded the umbilical through
     the guide - pulled it - and looked over the top of
     the Spacecraft to see that it was taut. It looked
     very taut to me and out of the way of all thrusters.
     However, when I began to put it in the umbilical
     guard on the handrail, I was about a foot from
     the mark that we had placed on this umbilical, so
     I began to wonder. I did work my way back to take
     another look at it on the adapter, pulled it tight,
     and it looked good to me, so I worked my way back
     into the adapter again. Now, here again it's very
     difficult to do things one-handed because of the
     strong wrist required. There's always a tendency
     to float up. If you hold on with one hand, your
     feet are going to come right on over the top of
     you. The stirrups are undoubtly the greatest
     thing that's happened, but even they, I think,
     should be configured somewhat, because it's pretty
     much of a very difficult task to don the AMU or
     probably any other vehicle in the adapter area.

[02:10:37:25]
_page : 298
P: I feel that without stirrups at all, just relying
     on something like Velcro or to hold one foot under
     the handrail - or one hand under the foot rail and
     one foot on top - would have been impossible because
     in donning the AMU, you have to have both
     hands free almost all the time. This requires you
     to be able to stay in the foot rail. It's a little
     bit different in 1 g. In 1 g you could put your
     feet in those rails, lean over and down to the
     fringe where the tether was, make all your tether
     hookings, tie into the extension without any problems
     at all. Here today, every time I would bend
     down there, I would float out. Then if I stiffened
     my ankles real tight and bent down there, it was
     an extremely difficult work load. I got the tether
     rig tied to my jumper with ease. Started out on a
     small tether hook, which I could do in 1 g with
     no problem at all, pressurized. But I had a great
     deal of difficulty with it today. I tried the large
     hook. I had a great deal of difficulty with it
     also, mainly because I needed two hands and I
     couldn't rely on two hands all the time. I couldn't
     rely on my feet to keep me in the stirrups and I
     couldn't rely on two hands to utilize in mating
     these hooks. I had to use one hand sometime to hold
     on with and force myself down in the stirrups. I
     finally got the large tether hook mated and I spent
     so much time on the other one that I decided that I
     was good for 125 feet of tether and I'd only go out
     so far on the first 25 feet. So I was tethered
     good, anyway, from the umbilical - from myself
     through the umbilical to the 125 feet. Tom, I
     think you turned these lights on about this time.

[02:10:39:14]
_page : 299
C: Right.

[02:10:39:15]
P: No, a little bit before that you turned them on
     because to get at the tether portside I had to
     take out the pen light.

[02:10:39:24]
C: Right. Did you float out of the stirrups at any
     time? Did you float out of the stirrups one time
     or a couple times?

[02:10:39:30]
P: I floated out of the stirrups continually - and
     that was one of my - that's why it took so much
     time.   I'd say wait until I get in position again
     because it was a two-footed and a one-handed task
     to stay in the stirrups. Again it was just a problem
     of floating up. But again the adapter didn't
     have anything hanging from it at all, just a pure,
     clean separation, Tom. Nothing back there at all.
     It was sharp in placed because I could see that
     fairly well. Let's see. We went though the
     checkoff list normally. Oh, the lights. We had
     the light - as I was facing the AMU - the light
     on the right worked, the one on the left did not.
     I had one good pen light so I put it on the left.
     I figured this would give me ample light, because
     I need most of the light on the left-hand side
     anyway to make my connection. We went through
     the normal donning of the AMU much more slowly -
     because of holding myself in position and - than
     we'd otherwise have to do. We can bend over to
     make and break these connections from the AMU.
     1 g pressurized is about 50% easier than 0 g.
     But I got all the AMU connections loose and fastened
     to the arm rails, went ahead and got the arm
     rails down.  Here again, retro were pyro-tested
     within 1 g pressurized; even in the zero g airplane
     pressurized, it is for some reason easier than this
     was. This was a very, very tough, two-handed operation.
     The point being, if I could get two hands
     on it the way I wanted to, it would be all right,
     but to get my body up where I could get two hands
     on it and reach around the bulky ELSS, my feet
     would come right out of the stirrups. I couldn't
     keep them in there at all, and this was a problem,
     Tom. Finally, got them both down. By that time
     I was probably a little bit bushed, but got them
     both down and got the bat wings installed. I even
     put the - the thermal - these little thermal tabs
     we had on there, and later on I noticed there was
     only one on there.  I noticed also, when we got in
     with the ELSS, but I definitely did put both of
     them on there. I guess one had floated away. Maybe
     I just picked it up again when I leaned over to
     do something.  We went through the procedures of
     checking out the nitrogen pressure and the oxygen
     and so forth and I swore here again I have never
     seen an oxygen valve that was as tight as this.

[02:10:42:32]
_page : 300
C: I heard - I heard you say that.

[02:10:42:33]
P: Never at anytime.

[02:10:42:34]
C: I think actually it was probably frozen.

[02:10:42:36]
P: I felt for sure that the oxygen valve was frozen.
     I finally got to it and I finally was able - or I
     got to it all right - and I had no problem because
     it was one-handed.  I held on with the other hand
     and had both feet in the stirrups in this case,
     because I was able to keep them there with my right
     hand.  Opening that thing with the left hand was the
     highest - was one of the highest valve forces
     I've ever felt on an AMU. I got it open, checked
     the pressures, and the nitrogen pressure looked
     like it was about 3000 and - I knew it was up there
     - I couldn't see exactly because of the size of the
     gage. The nitrogen pressure - or oxygen pressure
     I could read upwards about 7000. So it looked
     good to me. We turned on the power switch and I
     got the light and I turned around and backed in.
     Now backing in, I must say - and I figured it
     would be, was an easier job in zero g than it was
     in 1 g because I was able to - I was much lighter
     and was able to sort of give myself a little
     twist and twist myself right around. I came in
     low and out of the way of the thruster extensions
     on the AMU and got back in the AMU and sat down.
     Prior to doing this, the sun was going down while
     I still had my back to the west. The sun was going
     down and I was going through - it took me a
     long time to work on these arms and get the AMU
     prepared to turn around and doff. The sun was
     just almost unbearably hot on my back from about
     the thigh on up to the small of my back. It just
     felt like I was sitting on a hot stove. I just
     had to - I - I was fine up until that point on
     medium flow - I had to go to high flow on the
     ELSS and I just had to wait there because even
     my hands, holding on to these handrails, I could
     feel in my fingertips how hot my hands were. It
     was just phenomenal - I couldn't believe things
     would be that hot. I just had to wait until things
     cooled off. Then about the time the sun went down,
     my visor started fogging and it started fogging
     slowly and I continued on, turned around, got in
     the AMU and then things started fogging up quite
     a bit. I got the tether positioned - out of the
     bag - positioned out of the way on the handrail
     where I wanted it, which looked pretty good, although
     floating at 0 g there's more umbilical and
     tether lines floating around than you'll ever
     believe. But you could keep track of them and
     keep them untangled. We then broke the electrical
     connection that went on the AMU - the AMU electrical
     connection - and I verified VOX that we had a COM
     check. Tom, you want to comment on that?

[02:10:45:27]
_page : 301
C: The COM check. When Gene would transmit the first
     part of his word - say the first word, or the first
     part of his first word would come in very clear,
     followed by a series of warbles all the rest of
     the way through. Sometimes it was running like
     the two  words through a series of warbles.   In
     these warbles he was practically unreadable. To
     me it presented a very marginal case as far as
     communications. If everything else had gone all
     right, I would have said GO when the AMU - with
     this type of communications.

[02:10:45:58]
_page : 302
P: I felt the communications were marginal too. The
     VOX was much more sensitive than I've ever - ever
     heard it for some reason.  I pushed - I think I
     solved the problem - I pushed the mike as far
     away with my lips and tongue as I could get them
     from my mouth, and that seemed to solve the VOX
     problem.  However, when Tom would talk, he'd be
     fairly clear but I could tell that I obviously
     lost, I don't know, at least 10 or 15 to 20 percent
     of his conversation. There was also a lot of
     background noise, and I brought up the left-hand
     rail and I tried to pull the talk mode.  I had
     the same results, so I knew it wasn't just VOX.
     It was just the general communications. They were
     acceptable, but not nearly as good as I had hoped
     they would be or as good as they checked out on
     the ground. About this time, my visor was really
     fogging up and I looked at my pressure gage. It
     was fogging up as a matter of fact, right now
     it's - I don't know how many hours later - 8 hours
     later - and there's - it's still solid water.

[02:10:47:02]
C: Nearly 10 hours later. And you still can't read
     it, can you?

[02:10:47:05]
P: Slowly, cross - slowly - no I can't read it -
     slowly around the edges, it's good for 30 minutes,
     but it's just solid with water. That's the way
     my visor was.  It just got - it got just completely
     fogged up and I could just about see that there
     was light glowing out there, and that's about it.
     That's why I tried to use the mirror to see things,
     and couldn't see through them at all because I
     couldn't see. I could feel, though, that my right
     controller - my attitude controller was not. I
     don't know why because this had happened the last

[02:10:50:08]
_page : 303
P: I actually - when we decided to come out of the
     adapter and give up on the AMU, I made sure all
     my connections were undone and I jettisoned the
     tether to make sure that got out of the way.
     Came back without much difficulty. I came back,
     actually, with the sun visor up. I did not have
     it down - it was daylight - I did not have it
     down. I worked my way around the adapter over
     the handrail.

[02:10:50:41]
C: Please keep your feet up.

[02:10:50:45]
P: Well, I could just begin to see now, through
     around a spot around my nose. The trouble is
     that spot stayed there --

[02:10:50:51]
C: That's right, you had a spot around your nose
     where you could see.

[02:10:50:52]
P: - - Around the center of the plate. The whole
     side here was fogged up and the whole side over
     here was fogged up. And I came around on the
     handrails and worked my way into the seat area
     and stood there for awhile because, admittedly,
     I was probably pretty tired by this time, and
     wanted to see what that visor would do. I put
     my sun visor down at this time because there
     didn't seem to be much appreciable change in the
     visor. It was daylight, so I thought it advisable
     to go ahead and put it down. I waited there for
     awhile and it slowly started to clear, but it
     would have been an hour in the sun before the
     water cleared out of it and, as I say, even here
     my pressure gage is still - still full of water.
     I couldn't read my pressure gage out there, even
     when I could see through my visor. We covered
     the EV camera and I handed the Hasselblad to Tom.
     I stayed out there for awhile and contemplated
     whether we should wait for darkness for S-1 or
     not. We decided we'd go ahead and try to get
     in. We gathered up the umbilical and worked my
     way in.

[02:10:52:07]
C: The Egress Maneuver proved every bit as difficult
     as what we anticipated, with respect to complexity
     of gear to be handled. We'd gone though it many
     times so we were prepared for it, but it was still
     a long tedious process. The hatch was also hard
     to open to the extent of the ... egress. Also
     hard to close for the first part of the stroke.

[02:10:52:31]
_page : 304
P: I think the hatch made it difficult for me to
     egress because I'd get personally in and then I'd
     try to pull the hatch and it was extremely stiff.
     When it was open 20 or 30 degrees - extremely
     stiff, and I had to get partially out to bring it
     in, and then try to go through my egress again
     and this was difficult. I knew I wasn't all the
     way down in with my knees when I leaned back, but
     we had the hatch coming, so I just pushed down
     with all I had from my arms and, believe it or
     not, Tom was able to - the last - 6 or 8 or 10
     inches in fast travel was very easy. Tom was
     able to get a good inertia on it and we locked
     it the first time. The trouble is - one thing
     I was trying to get clear from the hatch area,
     Tom, was the oxygen lines and my tiedown cord,
     and there was a line from the umbilical guard
     that was floating around, and I didn't want to
     get anything caught in the hatch seal. There
     were a number of things that were floating out in
     that area. I think just - I know there's many
     more things I'm going to remember - but some
     things that are probably worth mentioning. I
     feel that all our egress work in the zero-g airplane
     is well and good, but it ought to be done
     after we're good and tired. The umbilical: I've
     got a note here on umbilical or egress, and I
     don't remember exactly what it was but it will
     come back to me I'm sure. The body inertia out
     there, again is a big thing; that - your tendency
     to float up - tendency not to be able to stabilize
     yourself with one hand by holding on to anything.
     Unless you've got extremely strong wrists, I think
     this is almost impossible for the average person
     to do and the ELSS prevents you from holding on to
     the same point or the same bar with both hands.
     If you can't get close enough to it, such as the
     docking bar, which is away behind the nose, or
     there's some obvious reason that you can't get
     close enough to hold on to anything unless it's
     right in front of the ELSS - you have to reach
     for a little bit. I think the S-1, after my experience
     with working - standing - in the cockpit
     and working in the cockpit - it's well and easy
     to say just go ahead and lean on the hatch or lean
     on the adapter and take a picture. If you just
     even stand in the hatch or the hatch area or the
     seat, Command Pilot Tom had to either hold my feet
     down or had to lock them under something. You're
     always floating in one direction or another, and
     to take S-1 pictures for 30-second exposure
     times I feel would have been impossible, and I
     don't feel we lost a thing. I hope possibly we
     gained something by taking the pictures from inside
     the Spacecraft.

[02:10:55:23]
_page : 305
C: Also, every slight motion he made, even standing
     up, would fire the thrusters. We were in Plat
     mode. One example, when you went to the adapter
     and I turned off the control power for approximately
     30 seconds, at the end of this time we were yawed
     over 100 degrees and pitched down 30 degrees - -

[02:10:55:50]
P: I couldn't tell - I was so busy wrapped up in
     everything else - -

[02:10:55:52]
C: - - Just for the torques you generated. I think
     that for the rest of the Gemini program, the ideal
     way is the way we did it. Use the Plat mode and
     Automatic Rate Stabilize Reference mode, because
     when Gene was working in the adapter, tugging on
     those arms, the Plat mode was firing continuously
     back there. The disturbing torques displaced on
     the Spacecraft were very difficult to overcome
     in Pulse mode. It would take a Direct mode in
     RATE COMMAND.

[02:10:56:22]
P: I feel that procedures in our planning were well
     thought out. I think they would have sufficed,
     but there were a number of unknown terms of operating
     back in the adapter section. Our experience
     thus far in EVA is to just let us work out in
     front of the Spacecraft a little bit - a little
     umbilical work but - we just - we just - never
     have done - never have done any long-term tasks
     such as working in the adapter. And you've got
     to fix yourself, fix your position back there or
     it's just such a workload - and such a task that
     it's almost unbelievable. I don't feel all was
     lost; as a matter of fact, I feel a great deal was
     gained. I feel that I was able to accomplish a
     great deal of work back there and look situations
     over and see what was happening, such as getting
     rid of the bathtub and what-have-you and, as I
     say, I think our procedures would have accomplished
     what we set out to do, but we obviously overlooked
     a number of very small things, one of which is the
     restriction that ELSS does give you when you want
     to reach out in front of you and you have to have
     two hands. I also - I will say that I don't feel
     that a large hook for anything is adequate. I
     think we ought to build one larger and make things
     easy - and not make things adequate for EVA anymore,
     but make them easy for EVA, which means
     going to the extreme of our logical thinking for
     normal 1 g flying. I know this is true, now.
     Okay, Tom, you might mention something about
     opening the left hatch with all the stuff you
     have in your - -

[02:10:58:02]
_page : 306
C: Right. With all the gear I had in my footwell,
     umbilical bag, which was later out, the S-10, and
     the other gear that I had stowed in the footwell,
     I think it would have been nearly an impossible
     task for me to open the hatch and do the egress
     after that. I could have opened the hatch, but
     I think there was a very low probability that I
     ever would have been able to get my hatch closed.
     So I - opening the Command Pilot's hatch during
     the Gemini program, I think is a last ditch resort
     and should be considered very carefully before it
     is ever attempted.

[02:10:58:47]
P: - - It is difficult for me to say whether we -
     how the water in the ELSS went - it did get hot
     toward the end - a little warm. I don't necessarily
     attribute it to ELSS, I attribute it to
     the - maybe to my workload, but I think it performed
     very well. I was doing fine on medium
     flow until I got that sun on my back and that was
     just - that was just unbelievably hot. Maybe I
     was in the focal point of the gold curtain back
     there; I don't know, but most of the heat was
     focused on my back and the back of my legs, not
     on the front, and it was unbearably hot. High
     flow didn't put a dent in it, and I think this is
     what started everything to fog up. The best way
     obviously to do it is out-of-plane so you don't
     have that sun on your back, but then I'm sure
     there are going to be some stationkeeping problems
     with other vehicles, at which time I know
     we'll have a lot to elaborate on later, probably.
     But I don't know. If we ever work in the adapter
     again, we're certainly going to have to consider
     that sun going down.

[02:10:59:51]
_page : 307
C: Right.

[02:10:59:56]
P: I failed to mention that during egress we did lose
     one roll of film. We don't know which one it was
     - exposed - unexposed - but we did lose one.

CC: Gemini IX, this is Houston.

[02:19:25:15]
C: Good morning, Houston. Gemini IX.

[02:19:25:19]
CC: Roger. How's everything going up there?

[02:19:25:22]
C: Roger. Pretty good. We've got the Platform
     Alined 0, 0, 0 degrees, and computer should
     go in on a different update mode. Our stowage
     is pretty well squared away.

[02:19:25:34]
CC: Okay. We have a message for you on the computer
     problem that we had the other day. You'll have
     to START COMP. When you get to switching into
     REENTRY, the computer running light comes on.
     An alternate procedure is to switch out of REENTRY
     to a spare position, which is one detent
     clockwise of REENTRY, and then switch back to
     REENTRY 1 second prior to retrofire.

[02:19:26:13]
C: Okay. We've just gone to REENTRY on the computer
     and the light does not come on.

[02:19:26:17]
CC: Okay. Good.

[02:19:26:35]
CC: Gemini IX, Houston.

[02:19:26:37]
C: GO, Houston.

[02:19:26:38]
CC: Roger. I've got some ball scores here if you're
     interested.

[02:19:26:42]
C: Okay. Let's hear them, Buzz.

[02:19:26:44]
CC: Roger. Which ones are you interested in? I've
     got the whole "smear" here.

[02:19:26:47]
C: Let's try the Astros and the Cubs.

[02:19:26:53]
CC: Okay. Pittsburgh 10, the Astros 5.

[02:19:27:01]
_page : 310
C: You struck out. Try again.

[02:19:27:05]
CC: Well, if I can read this message, it looks like
     the Reds 5 - the Reds 8 and the Cubs 3.

[02:19:27:12]
C: Yes, you ought to go back to sweeping the streets;
     you struck out again.

[02:19:27:16]
CC: Doesn't sound very good, right? Okay. We had a
     tornado in Enid, Oklahoma. How's that one?

[02:19:27:24]
C: In Enid?

[02:19:27:25]
CC: Yes.

[02:19:27:27]
C: How's the weather in Houston?

[02:19:27:30]
CC: Looked pretty good when I came in.

[02:19:27:33]
C: Pretty dark out, right?

[02:19:27:39]
CC: Can you see anything of a tropical storm about,
     oh, a little bit behind you right now. There is
     supposed to be a storm building south of Cuba
     called - it'll be called Alma, if it reaches that
     strength.

[02:19:27:56]
C: We're in darkness right now, Buzz. Can you give
     us a latitude and longitude on it?

[02:19:28:21]
CC: How about 85 degrees west and about 18 degrees
     north?

[02:19:28:27]
C: 85 and 18. Okay.

[02:19:28:32]
P: Looks like we pass just about over it next time
     around.

[02:19:28:36]
CC: On the Cubs, Gene - had a double header. The
     first one was Reds 8, and the Cubs 3, and the
     second one, Cubs won 9 - 5.

[02:19:28:46]
P: Yippee!

[02:19:28:54]
P: Out of two teams, I haven't gotten many wins this
     week.

CC: Say again?

[02:19:29:27]
P: I said out of two teams, I don't have many wins
     this week.

[02:19:29:54]
P: Is poor Ed going out pulling his hair out after
     yesterday?

[02:19:30:03]
CC: Gemini IX, Houston. I didn't read your last
     transmission. Could you give us a Propellant
     Quantity, please?

[02:19:30:09]
C: Roger. We're reading zero on the gage, but we
     still haven't had a drop on our fuel regulated
     pressure, so we're not on the Volkswagen tank yet.

[02:19:30:20]
CC: Okay. I understand. What's that pressure showing
     now?

[02:19:30:24]
C: Say again?

[02:19:30:25]
CC: What is the pressure showing now?

[02:19:30:27]
C: Roger. 305.

[02:19:30:29]
CC: Good enough. Ready to get a vector to go get
     the ATDA?

[02:19:30:36]
C: Say again. We've got a little bit of fuel left;
     we might try to work in a fourth one.

[02:19:30:44]
CC: Might as well.

[02:19:30:57]
C: We had good solid lock on the radar yesterday.
     170 miles on it.

[02:19:31:03]
CC: Yes. That was real good.

[02:19:31:14]
CC: Gemini IX, Houston.

[02:19:31:16]
C: Go ahead.

[02:19:31:18]
CC: What sort of reading are you getting now on
     your Cabin Pressure?

[02:19:31:22]
C: Roger. We're about 4.8.

[02:19:31:24]
_page : 312
CC: Roger. That's quite close to what we've got
     here.

[02:19:31:28]
C: It has been holding about 4.9 to 4.8 all night
     long.

[02:19:31:31]
CC: Okay. Very good.

P: Go ahead, Houston.

[02:19:32:03]
CC: Roger, Gene. Chris is wondering when he ought
     to get the cigars out to light up, once you hit
     the water.

[02:19:32:12]
P: When he sees our smiling face on the carrier,
     and I'll buy.

[02:19:32:16]
CC: You'll buy, is that right?

[02:19:32:27]
C: Tell Chris that I might even break training
     after splashdown and smoke one, too.

[02:19:32:36]
CC: I'm not sure I read that right.

[02:19:32:39]
C: You did.

[02:19:32:41]
CC: Okay. We'll be seeing you, oh, perhaps later
     on this afternoon.

CC: Gemini IX, Houston.

[02:19:33:43]
C: Go ahead, Houston. With you.

[02:19:33:45]

     members have had two meals since yesterday evening.

[02:19:38:33]
C: It looks like it's nice and sunny out in the
     Canaries today.

[02:19:38:36]

     going to take some pictures on this pass and then
     finish the stowage.

[02:19:39:46]
CC: Okay. Very good.

[02:19:40:23]
P: Canaries, IX. Which island is the tracking site
     on?

[02:19:40:28]
CC: It's on the Grand Canary Island.

[02:19:40:31]
P: Is that the big one in the middle?

[02:19:40:33]
CC: Right, that's the big one. Way down at the south

[02:20:55:22]
CC: Good morning, Tom. We're standing by.

[02:20:55:24]
C: Roger. In our Pre-Retro Check during stowage, as
     I was checking through the cockpit, I knocked off
     one of the Electronic Timer circuit breakers for
     about 1 second and got it back on. Checked; all
     the clocks run the same as the electric clock does.

[02:20:55:46]
CC: Okay. We're not reading you too well. Wait till
     we get a little more elevation here.

[02:20:55:48]
_extra : TEXAS
C: Okay.

[02:20:56:28]
CC: IX, Houston. You say you find your Electronic
     Timer circuit breaker knocked off for a little bit
     and it's reset.

[02:20:56:35]
C: Roger. I caught it when I knocked it off and got
     it right back on. Probably a second or so off.
     We'll have to recheck all the clocks for sync.

[02:20:56:45]
CC: We'll have to update that thing anyway.

[02:20:56:47]
_page : 315
C: Yes. Okay.

[02:21:03:37]
C: Roger. We should be approaching that tropical
     storm about now. We'll pitch down and see if we
     can take a look at it.

[02:21:03:42]
CC: Okay. That's the one in your landing area.

[02:21:03:49]
C: That's just about in the landing area. Right?

[02:21:04:01]
CC: Roger. We have you approaching 250 on your VW
     tank. When you get to that value you might arm it.

[02:21:04:10]
C: Roger.

[02:21:07:13]
C: Houston, Gemini IX. We're arming the Volkswagen
     tank at this time.

[02:22:36:52]

     Ready?

[02:23:49:46]
P: UP.

[02:23:49:51]
P: Okay.You got started, didn't you?

[02:23:49:53]
C: Yes.

[02:23:49:55]
P: Okay. FDI scale HIGH. Our RCS Control Power B,
     OFF. Attitude Control, PULSE. Boost Insert Control
     1 and 2 circuit breakers, OPEN.

[02:23:50:06]

P: What do I put the Cabin Air Recirc valve at, 45?

[02:23:50:51]
C: 45.

[02:23:50:53]
P: Okay. 45.

[02:23:50:59]
C: You are roll and burn. FDR-COMP and FDM-ATTITUDE.
     Stations check as are. Report Check List complete.

[02:23:51:10]
P: Houston, Gemini IX. Our Post-Retro Check List is
     complete.

[02:23:51:15]
CC: Roger.

[02:23:51:20]
P: See, a minus 2. Minus 2, plus 13. Minus 2 and
     plus 13.

[02:23:51:55]
_extra : HAWAII
P: 65 degrees would be the back-up, Tom.

[02:23:52:01]
CC: Gemini, Hawaii.

[02:23:52:03]
C: Hawaii, Gemini IX.

[02:23:52:04]
CC: Roger. If you'll set 6 minutes in your elapsed
     timer I'll give you a hack on time since Retrofire.

[02:23:52:14]
CC: 30 seconds.

[02:23:52:20]
P: Roger. We're counting now on the event timer but
     go ahead and give us a hack at 6 minutes, Hawaii.

[02:23:52:25]
CC: Roger. Will do.

[02:23:52:32]
P: Yes. The back-up would be 65 degrees.

[02:23:52:43]
CC: 3, 2, 1,

[02:23:52:45]
CC: MARK.

[02:23:52:51]
P: Roger. We're on it.

[02:23:52:54]
_page : 335
CC: Gemini IX, Hawaii.

[02:23:53:03]
CC: Gemini IX, Hawaii.

[02:23:53:07]
C: Hawaii, Gemini IX. We were inverted and we have
     an inverted horizon.

[02:23:53:12]
CC: Roger. Were you with me over the Mark?

[02:23:53:14]
C: We're right on it.

[02:23:53:16]
CC: Roger.

[02:23:53:17]
CC: Do you have air AUTO RETRO?

[02:23:53:18]
C: Sure did. Had the Automatic Retro 296 aft, 4
     right, and 125 down.

[02:23:53:29]
CC: Roger. Your attitude is normal.

[02:23:53:31]
C: Right on the money.

[02:23:53:32]
P: Okay, Tom. Back-up with this time. 65 degrees
     and we will reverse bank 3 seconds earlier than
     what they gave us.

[02:23:53:42]
CC: Okay?

[02:23:53:44]
C: That's affirm.

[02:23:53:46]
C: Couldn't we get a lot of these switches off now?
     You get the Maneuver Thrusters, I'll get all
     these - -

[02:23:53:50]
P: Okay. You get those on that side, and I'll take
     a look at what we have over here.

[02:23:54:01]
C: - - These Attitude Control and Fuel and Temperature
     are all OFF. Cryo Quantity is OFF. Okay, Turn
     the Heater - Left Heater is OFF. Right Heater is
     OFF. Fuel Cell is OFF.

[02:23:54:29]
P: Okay, Tom. You were at nominal. Aft was 296, you
     had 298. And nominal up/down was 112 and you had
     125.

[02:23:54:43]
P: Boy! There was a delay between the third and
     fourth retro.

[02:23:54:46]
_page : 336
C: Yes.

[02:23:54:47]
P: Boy, oh boy!

[02:23:54:50]
P: Okay. You've got the P and the 400K over there,
     right?

[02:23:54:55]
C: Check.

[02:23:54:58]
P: Okay. I'm all set till we get to 70K.

[02:23:55:02]
C: Okay. Lock. Retro aft. Understand ... to left.
     Start blackout.

[02:23:55:11]
CC: Gemini IX, Hawaii. We have 1 minute to LOS and
     standing by.

[02:23:55:14]
C: Roger, Hawaii. See you back in Houston.

[02:23:55:17]
CC: Roger.

[02:23:55:22]
P: That's a real kick, isn't it?

[02:23:55:24]
C: Real long steady -

[02:23:55:26]
P: Man! I tell you though, I waited a long time for
     that fourth retro.

[02:23:55:35]
P: Okay, Tom. Let's fly the Reentry the way we can.

[02:23:55:38]
C: Power on ...

[02:23:55:49]
C: Okay ...

[02:23:55:59]
P: What time is it? I've got all the Fuel Cell switches
     OFF and my circuit breaker panel's OFF - or
     I can get it OFF. And we can get all these pumps
     OFF. We don't have them any more, do we?

[02:23:56:09]
C: Fuel Pumps coming OFF.

[02:23:56:11]
P: Okay.

[02:23:56:14]
P: And what was tape time, Tom?

[02:23:56:20]
C: 19 plus 52.

[02:23:56:37]
_page : 337
P: 18 plus 52. Okay. I've got that written down.
     It's back here, though.

[02:23:56:41]
C: Get ready and I'll call them off before I hit it
     on.

[02:23:56:47]
P: Okay.

[02:23:56:48]
C: I've got the jettison right there.

[02:23:57:06]
C: How about a little computer.

[02:23:57:09]
P: You bet your life it came on normally. I would
     push START COMP - I don't want it to freeze so - -

[02:23:57:19]
P: Yes. Let's see, we've got 2300 in Ring A, 2300
     in Ring B.

[02:23:57:23]
C: ...

[02:23:57:26]
P: And we're using the remainder at this time. Scanners
     are OFF; Gyros are ON; Radar is OFF.  I guess
     we can't push much else off, Tom.

[02:23:57:40]
C: All set on you? Over there on the pulse?

[02:23:57:46]
P: Yes. All set.

[02:23:57:47]
C: Really going to feel good to feel these g's. I'm
     not kidding you.

[02:23:57:50]
P: How high do you think we'll get up there?

[02:23:57:52]
C: ... what we had going out on lock.

[02:23:57:55]
P: Oh, really?

[02:23:57:56]
C: Packed itself way down.

[02:23:58:34]
P: Picked up sunlight.

[02:23:58:36]
P: Oh boy!

[02:23:58:41]
C: That's it now. There's no doubt about it.

[02:23:58:43]
P: Man, that's - that's really - really something!

[02:23:58:53]
P: You got that horizon? I don't see the horizon.

[02:23:58:55]
_page : 338
C: Had it for a second.

[02:23:58:58]
P: Okay.

[02:23:59:35]
P: Well, we're still moving east, according to the
     computer.

[02:23:59:39]
C: Well, I've got the horizon out there now. Look.

[02:23:59:48]
P: Boy! That's pretty out there, Tom.

[02:23:59:51]
C: Far as seeing sights, you haven't seen anything
     yet. Wait till you see the big fireball.

[03:00:00:44]
P: What's all that stuff coming out there behind us?

[03:00:00:46]
C: Oh, just some pyro.

[03:00:00:50]
P: Why did you start retro pack just now?

[03:00:00:53]
C: The retro pack will be behind us and above us and
     look like it's up there.

[03:00:01:14]
P: There's that horizon.

[03:00:01:27]
P: If you want to, go to left to 50 degrees.

[03:00:01:29]
C: Okay.

[03:00:01:45]
P: I've got to show a little bias in that last bit of
     information I gave you.

[03:00:01:48]
CC: Hello, Gemini IX. This your Houston Prime Contractor
     standing by.

[03:00:01:49]
P: I said 65, but that's based on 55 being nominal.
     So it would be bank left 60 degrees, Tom, in case
     we lose the computer.

[03:00:02:09]
P: And it would be reverse main type.

[03:00:02:37]
P: Okay? If we lose comp at left bank 60, and reverse
     bank on time, or would it be bank left 60 and bank
     right - let's see - 50.

[03:00:03:30]
P: We're over the US.

[03:00:03:56]
C: Retro bank nominal is left 50 degrees.

[03:00:03:57]
_page : 339
P: Retro bank nominal is left 50 degrees. Got that
     written down there?

[03:00:04:02]
C: Yes.

[03:00:04:03]
P: If you don't, I'll look it up again.

[03:00:04:10]
C: The right ...

[03:00:04:12]
P: Okay. If you've got it, I won't look it up. Left
     50 degrees I'm sure but those numbers I gave you
     were back-up angles - back-up "lost comp angles"
     based upon our Retrofire. I feel certain we'll get
     an update here pretty sudden anyway.

[03:00:04:52]
P: Bank left 50, bank right 60. You have the other
     numbers now? Okay.

[03:00:05:13]
_extra : TEXAS
P: There's the moon up there.

[03:00:05:18]
CC: Okay, Gemini IX. We're ready with the Retro update
     when you're ready to copy.

[03:00:05:24]
P: Go.

[03:00:05:25]
CC: 400K is 19 plus 37. Skip down to blackout. That's
     22 plus 01; end blackout, 27 plus 07; drogue, 28
     plus 43; main, 30 plus 08. Your downrange needle
     deflection, 10 plus 94.

[03:00:05:50]
P: Roger. We've got our 400K, 19 plus 37; blackout,
     22 plus 01; and blackout, 27 plus 07; drogue at
     28 plus 43; main at 30 plus 08; downrange, 10 plus
     94.

[03:00:06:11]
P: Okay. 400K is 19 plus 37, Tom.

[03:00:06:25]
CC: There's a - that looks like it was based on your
     IVI's. We'll be getting you any other data we
     can from radar.

[03:00:06:32]
P: Roger. Understand.

[03:00:06:35]
_page : 340
C: Hey, and we have the deflection within one second
     400K!

[03:00:06:38]
CC: Very good.

[03:00:06:42]
C: Going to roll left 50 degrees.

[03:00:06:44]
P: Okay, Tom. Roll left 50.

[03:00:07:05]
C: Real good beginning.

[03:00:07:17]
CC: Gemini IX, Houston. Got your bank angle?

[03:00:07:23]
C: Roger. We're rolling left 50 right now.

[03:00:07:29]
CC: Okay. Your back-up bank angles are 28 degrees
     left, and bank right 38. RET RB is 25 plus 27.

[03:00:07:40]
P: Back-up bank left 28 bank right 38; RET RB 25
     plus 27.

[03:00:07:45]
CC: Roger.

[03:00:07:46]
C: Check.

[03:00:07:53]
P: That's back-up, Tom. 50 degrees. Go to 50 degrees.

[03:00:07:57]
C: Okay.

[03:00:07:58]
P: Okay. This is back-up angle of 50 degrees.

[03:00:08:01]
C: What's our status?

[03:00:08:03]
P: They haven't had any banks yet, have they?

[03:00:08:05]
C: Yes.

[03:00:08:32]
C: ...

[03:00:08:35]
P: Yes.

[03:00:08:37]
P: Okay. Even the computer is GO, Tom.

[03:00:08:38]
CC: See you after blackout.

[03:00:08:39]
C: Okay. Go ahead. Put it on, Gene.

[03:00:08:44]
_page : 341
P: Roger. Blackout is 22 plus 01.

[03:00:08:59]
P: No Guidance yet, right?

[03:00:09:01]
C: No.

[03:00:09:03]
P: What time's that thing supposed to ring in?

[03:00:09:19]
P: There's Guidance, Tom. Turn deflection in about
     20, 40, 80, 120, miles. 120 miles. Want you to
     roll right for that position.

[03:00:09:36]
C: Roll right? ... high?

[03:00:09:39]
C: Say again.

[03:00:09:40]
C: There's Guidance, Tom. Turn-rate needle deflection
     is about 20, 40, 80 - about 120 miles.

[03:00:09:41]
P: Okay. It's coming in real nice.

[03:00:09:45]
P: All for roll right.

[03:00:09:47]
C: You want to fly it?

[03:00:09:49]
P: Fly it. It looks good. That's what they said
     about 94 when we got 120.

[03:00:09:53]
C: Okay.

[03:00:09:54]
P: We just passed over Houston.

[03:00:10:00]
P: Look at that!

[03:00:10:05]
P: Okay. It's calling for bank right slightly. Push
     START COMP and a full left.

[03:00:10:20]
P: Keep going now. You've got a good braking line,
     now.

[03:00:10:48]
P: I got another minute and a half yet.

[03:00:10:53]
P: Tell you when.

[03:00:10:58]
P: Beautiful out here, isn't it?

[03:00:11:00]
P: Okay. Still full left and earth is coming slowly,
     Tom.

[03:00:11:07]
_page : 342
P: Starting to come in slowly and we're coming in at
     low range.

[03:00:11:22]
C: ...

[03:00:11:27]
P: Okay, She's coming in Tom, slowly. You're about
     40 miles till earth. 40 miles to it. Still coming
     in closer. You can go ahead and turn it if you
     want to.

[03:00:11:42]
C: Okay.

[03:00:11:43]
P: Okay. It's beautiful. ...

[03:00:11:50]
P: Okay. Now we're going to start rolling downrange
     just about any time. Crossrange looks real good.

[03:00:12:00]
P: Boy! What a fireball! Whew!

[03:00:12:02]
P: Okay. Commanding you roll right. What a fireball!

[03:00:12:14]
P: Boy! We're really doing something, aren't we?

[03:00:12:18]
C: 2 g's.

[03:00:12:20]
P: Okay.

[03:00:12:21]
C: 2 g's.

[03:00:12:22]
P: Boy! It's just about 5.

[03:00:12:24]
P: Okay. Still holding on. The time is just about
     out.

[03:00:12:26]
C: That's good enough. Boy, look at that fire!

[03:00:13:06]
P: Okay. GO on roll right, Tom.

[03:00:13:11]
P: Beautiful!

[03:00:13:12]
C: Keep rolling right.

[03:00:13:22]
P: I wish I could catch up with those numbers like he
     can.

[03:00:13:26]
C: Keep rolling right.

[03:00:13:29]
_page : 343
P: Keep it rolling right. Beautiful!

C: Roger.

[03:00:13:51]
P: Okay.

[03:00:14:05]
C: I think we're coming at it.

[03:00:14:07]
CC: Gemini IX, Houston. Your drogue and main times
     are good.

[03:00:14:16]
C: Roger. Can you read me?

[03:00:14:27]
CC: Read you loud and clear.

[03:00:14:32]
C: We are absolutely GO.

[03:00:14:34]
CC: Very good.

[03:00:14:48]
C: We're rolling to the left. 2-1/2 feet.

[03:00:14:56]
CC: Roger. We're with you.

[03:00:15:00]
P: You're right over the top of it. You're right over
     the top of it; right over the carrier.

[03:00:15:08]
P: Right over the top of it right now. You're barely
     in sight.

[03:00:15:16]
CC: Gemini IX, West Lant. You're on.

[03:00:15:17]
C: Roger. West Lant. We're ... coming down.

[03:00:15:19]
CC: Gemini IX, give us your reading. Over.

[03:00:15:21]

C: We've got the drogue out. Coming down.

[03:00:15:58]
CC: Where are you, Gemini IX? Are you braking now?
     I can hear you but I can't read. Keep talking.

[03:00:16:02]
P: Gemini IX. Roger. Estimating about 2 miles over
     the target. 2 miles long.

[03:00:16:10]
CC: Roger. Understand you're estimating close to here.

[03:00:16:14]
P: Roger. Estimating 2-1/2 miles long. 2-1/2 miles
     long.

[03:00:16:18]
CC: 2-1/2 miles from Wasp. We concur.

[03:00:16:24]
C: Liquid coming over the cockpit. Better get your
     gear because ...

[03:00:16:34]
C: At 20,000 feet ... How are we doing?

[03:00:16:37]
CC: Roger, Gemini IX.

[03:00:16:48]
C: How is the cockpit?

[03:00:16:50]
P: Don't ask me.

[03:00:16:55]
P: We don't have a main yet.

[03:00:16:57]

C: This is Gemini IX. Estimating 3.3 miles long.
     3.3 miles long.

[03:00:17:05]
CC: Roger. You are estimating 3.3 miles long.

[03:00:17:09]

     that.

[03:00:17:33]
C: ...

[03:00:17:36]
P: Yes, I do too.

[03:00:17:39]
C: I'll go in that one.

[03:00:17:40]
P: Okay.

[03:00:17:41]
C: Let's hold on before we do our ...

[03:00:17:42]
P: Okay.

[03:00:17:43]
P: Gemini IX. Estimating 3.5 miles long. We're on
     the main this time.

[03:00:17:49]
C: Switch now?
