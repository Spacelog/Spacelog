     almost too accurate for the actual observation
     that I have within the capsule.

     the yaw axes (indicator) at about 10 degrees
     right, at this time, and clouds are tracking
     right up the line, as if the yaw axes might be

P: Roger. Zanzibar. Sorry I miscalled you. I am going
     to set my . . . setting on the suit coolant valve
     to 5.5. Over.

P: Hello, Zanzibar this is Sigma Seven. How do you
     read? Over.

[00:00:32:02]
CC: Seven this is Zanzibar Cap Com. Read you loud and
     clear now. Go ahead.

[00:00:32:05]
P: Roger. I have set my suit control valve to 5.5. The
     suit dome temperature is 80 (degrees). Over.

[00:00:32:19]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[00:00:32:20]
P: The cabin dome is 55 (degrees) and is apparently
     under control.

[00:00:32:27]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[00:00:32:30]
P: My suit temperature has come down to 75 (degrees) at
     this time.

P: In fact, that's a correction, it hasn't come down.
     It's just going there. I would like to give you
     a briefing on my control mode. I am in auto mode,
     the bypass switch is normal, maneuver off. Fuel
     is in the green. Oxygen is way in the green. All
     electrical is in the green.

[00:00:33:03]
CC: Roger. Seven. Your (recovery area) 2-1 retrosequence

[00:00:33:20]
CC: Seven, Zanzibar.

[00:00:33:21]
P: Roger. I'm sorry I was trying to get my card out. I
     understand [time:00:01:28:21|01 28 21].

[00:00:33:25]
CC: Yeah.

[00:00:33:27]
P: Okay.

[00:00:34:39]
CC: . . . Zanzibar.

[00:00:34:41]
P: Go ahead, Zanzibar.

[00:00:34:44]
CC: All systems are green here on the ground. We get
     a good [glossary:T/M].

[00:00:34:52]
P: Roger. Zanzibar. I'm all green here. I'm still
     working on the suit current circuit.

[00:00:35:02]
CC: Roger. How do you feel? Uncomfortable?

[00:00:35:05]
P: I feel quite comfortable. I'm a little warm.
     Particularly from sunlight but other than that I
     feel fine.

[00:00:35:13]
CC: Roger.

[00:00:35:14]
P: I am holding the suit control setting at 5.5 for a
     little longer.

[00:00:35:22]
CC: Roger. You changed that over Kano awhile ago.
     Affirmative.

[00:00:35:24]

     weather down there, too.

CC: Very good.

[00:00:35:34]
P: I've got a lot of good clouds for yaw checks. I'll
     say that.

[00:00:35:37]
CC: Right.

[00:00:35:38]
P: Would you check your yaw reading on what you read for
     me in yaw at this time?

[00:00:35:48]
CC: Roger. We are getting about a +5 degrees. Over.

[00:00:35:51]
P: Roger. Concur. I am trying to come back toward 0
     (degrees) now.

[00:00:36:01]
CC: Roger. We are pulling you right back to 0 (degrees)
     now.

[00:00:36:03]
P: Okay. That's the - that's the [glossary:ASCS] system doing it
     for me, of course. I'm going to have to increase
     the suit setting. I'm just barely breaking even.
     I'm going to set the suit control valve to number 6.

[00:00:36:18]
CC: Roger. Understand. It's been about 10 minutes.

[00:00:36:22]
P: Roger. Thank you. The cabin is holding very well on
     settings, and I'm perfectly comfortable there.

[00:00:36:57]
CC: Seven this is Zanzibar. We have [glossary:LOS] in approximately
     1 minute. Anything else to report?

[00:00:37:03]
P: Nothing. I will keep the suit setting at this point
     until it gets a little hotter. If it does I may
     have to go up another half notch at about 45 (minutes),
     before I get to Woomera.

[00:00:37:15]
CC: Roger. Understand. I would like a reading on that
     before we get [glossary:LOS] please.

[00:00:37:19]

     Over.

[00:00:38:57]
P: This is Sigma Seven. I read you. It's rather . . .
     very garbled. I did not observe my HF antennas on
     turnaround. The rages were just too much smaller,
     I assume. I am going to switch now to VOX off and
     go to HF.

[00:00:39:45]

P: Hello Muchea, hello Muchea Cap Com this is Sigma
     Seven. HF. How do you read? Over.

[00:00:41:00]
P: This is Sigma Seven. I have noticed minute objects
     that I can knock off the capsule, one or two, in
     the bright sunlight at [glossary:CET] [time:00:00:41:10|41 10].

     and clear.

?: 12 53 00. He talked to Guaymas after we
     finished and [glossary:IOS] picked him up. Out.

[00:00:43:01]
P: The last station that talked on HF I could not
     identify. It came in very clear and should be
     recorded aboard the capsule at approximately
     43 minutes, 10 seconds elapsed time.

[00:00:43:24]
P: I have switched to VOX transmit and record. I
     am satisfied that I can see yaw through the
     window on [glossary:ASCS] without the use of the reticle
     by letting images come up from all sides.     
     It's only a matter of a short period of time
     before objects show translation immediately.

[00:00:44:07]
P: The pitch scribe mark does indicate up a little
     bit and as a result matches the retroattitude,
     which at this time, is 30 degrees. I am now
     yawed right approximately 10 degrees, and it
     looks like I am tracking right down the line.

[00:00:44:35]
P: I am at 45 minutes. I am going to increase the
     suit setting knob just a small amount, about a
     quarter of a turn. I think we almost have
     control of the situation. I have set the suit
     knob at 6.25. The dome temperature at this time
     is 82 (degrees). Suit inlet is 76 (degrees).

[00:00:45:10]
P: I definitely can see a right roll at this time
     of about 5 degrees, and I noticed the periscope
     is dark, meaning we are coming into the dark
     side. I will attempt to look for the changes
     through the periscope for any observations.
     At this time, I can see nothing through the periscope
     for night observation, at least in this
     attitude. I'm not even sure when I have low mag,
     other than the position of the lever. The window
     is cloudy. I have sunlight on it now and it definitely
     has been clouded over by the escape tower
     rocket, not to a great degree. I am seeing the
     so-called fireflies drift dramatically at this
     point. I tried a couple of knocks and they
     definitely have a relative velocity to the vehicle,
     but apparently are part of the same orbital system,
     I definitely see them as white objects.

[00:00:46:39]

P: I would like to take some water to drink at this
     point, but I would rather keep the visor shut to
     keep the system attempting to cool down. We may
     make some progress on the cold side. It looks like
     I am going to have to decrease the cabin, it's gone
     down to 45 (degrees) dome. I'm coming to 3.5
     on the cabin.

[00:00:47:03]
P: Checking on inverters at this time. They look very
     good. 150 is 102 (degrees). 250 is approximately
     107 (degrees). Going back to cabin heat exchanger.

[00:00:47:24]
P: Coming into the night side now at approximately 47
     minutes elapsed time. I set the cabin suit to 3.5.
     The suit dome is now just, correction - the cabin
     dome is nearing 50 (degrees) again. I will leave
     that setting at 3.5 for a period of time.

[00:00:48:19]
P: With this much sunlight, I cannot see stars at all.
     Sun is off to my left and I am getting close to
     sunset at approximately - 49 is the schedule time.
     That's just about right on. I'm approaching 49
     and the cabin lights are on white. I am going to
     switch the cabin lights to red. And turn off that
     blasted lift-off correlation clock light.

[00:00:49:03]
P: Oh, I almost missed my first sunset trying to get the
     right cabin light off. It is rather rapid as I was
     told it would be. I am not able to, there I have
     got Arcturus right on the right side where it
     belongs.
     Very nice. I should be able to pick up Muchea shortly,
     at 50. Having trouble seeing the clock at 49 minutes.

P: Muchea Cap Com. Sigma Seven. HF. I read you loud and
     clear. Over.

[00:00:49:54]
CC: Roger. You are loud and clear also. How do you feel?

[00:00:49:58]
P: I feel very good, Gene. I am on HF at this time with the
     dipole. The--I've readjusted the cabin setting. It--the
     dome went down to about 45 degrees. I set the cabin at
     3.5 as the cabin coolant valve setting. Do you understand?

[00:00:50:22]
CC: You set the cabin at 3.5. Is that correct?

[00:00:50:25]
P: That's right because it is reading a little low. On the suit,
     I am now at 6 and I am going to increase to 6.5. I am not
     making much progress. I went to about 6.25 about 5 minutes
     ago and I'm now, setting the suit control to 6.5. The dome
     is reading 82 [degrees].

[00:00:50:50]
CC: Checked the dome temperature on the suit is 82 [degrees] and
     you have just now set to 6.5. Do you feel too hot or
     anything?

[00:00:50:58]
P: No. I have beads of perspiration on my lips. That's about all.

[00:00:51:07]

     is acting perfectly. The maneuver switch
     is off. The systems are all green. I'm
     practically using no auto fuel. My only
     problem area is the suit circuit, which I am
     monitoring very carefully.

     emergency voice check. The next transmission
     will be on emergency voice.

P: Negative. I've tried not to get into that.
     If I can get the suit temperature down a little
     bit, I'll open the visor and get some water
     then.

[00:00:52:25]
CC: Roger. Understand. Status of the Woomera
     flare test is okay. They are going to light
     them, but there is broken clouds and light
     rain. No lightning reported. They will fire

     reference. Just no sweat on it at all.

[00:00:55:29]
CC: Roger. Understand. Very good yaw reference.

[00:00:55:32]
P: That's affirmative. I'm still on automatic
     control. I'm going to switch to fly-by-wire
     shortly.

[00:00:55:41]
CC: Roger. We will standby and expect you to report
     control mode when you change to fly-by-wire low;
     and gyros free.

[00:00:55:49]
P: I am switching - My cabin is working okay. The
     suit is okay. I'm going to go down for the
     yaw check. Correction, for the flare check
     now. I'm pitching down in fly-by-wire low.

[00:00:56:05]
CC: Roger. Understand.

CC: Roger.

[00:00:56:29]
P: Setting is -50(degrees). Gyros are free. Holding
     at -50 (degrees). Standing by for flare. Roll
     and yaw are holding. I see the flare on my
     left which is kinda wrong, I think. I think
     I saw a flash of lightning. Probably - that is
     lightning I'm seeing, not the flare. I'm
     seeing more lightning. It is going to be hard
     to tell what I am seeing whether it's lightning
     or flares.

     problem for me in trying to get the right cabin
     light dimmed down to red. It's very hard to
     reach due to ditty bag. I have not even
     messed around with the camera. I don't intend
     to until I have the suit circuit under control.

P: Roger. I have lightning only. It looks like
     you're just about socked in. I'll stay here
     for a while and then come back up to [glossary:ASCS]
     shortly. I think I saw lightning right below
     me but it couldn't have been the flare. It
     should burn steadily as I understand it.

CC: Correct.

     than a jagged streak we are use to seeing
     when earthbound. Just looks like a big -
     almost like a antiaircraft shot. A big
     blob of bright light, and then it fades out
     almost instantly. It definitely looks like
     you are overcast. By the way, how is my HF

     dome is 82 (degrees).

[00:01:02:33]
CC: Okay. We got that.

[00:01:02:34]
P: Roger. I'm going to increase my setting to 7
     on the coolant control on the suit. I'm
     now in automatic mode, gyros are normal.

[00:01:02:50]
CC: Suit setting at 7.

[00:01:02:52]

P: The suit coolant valve setting is 7. That
     is correct.

[00:01:02:56]
CC: Scanners and attitudes agree here.

[00:01:02:58]
P: Roger. I'm in orbit mode and tracking very
     well.

[00:01:03:03]
CC: Roger. We had [glossary:T/M] [glossary:LOS]. Correction, we've got
     it back.

[00:01:03:07]
P: Roger. I'm going to decrease the cabin setting
     It's still running a little cool.

[00:01:03:20]
CC: Roger.

[00:01:03:22]
P: I will set the cabin at setting number 3.

[00:01:03:27]
CC: Roger. Number 3 for cabin.

[00:01:03:30]
P: I just set now, MARK,<sup>T</sup> at number
     3, and the suit is riding at number 7.

[00:01:03:38]
CC: Roger. And Woomera has had [glossary:T/M] [glossary:LOS]. We are
     standing by HF.

[00:01:03:47]
P: Roger. Am definitely see some white at this
     time under the overcast, and I'm sure it must
     be one of your major cities, possibly Brisbane.
     I'm not sure.

[00:01:04:06]
CC: All we got was, "under the overcast", on that
     transmission.

[00:01:04:10]
P: It looks like a city under the overcast. I'm
     not sure. At about - almost right in the
     middle of the window at this time.

[00:01:04:26]
CC: Sigma Seven, Woomera read your last transmission.

[00:01:04:57]
P: This is Sigma Seven. Going to fly-by-wire low
     and pitching up to reentry attitude. Selecting
     reentry on attitude select.

[00:01:05:56]
_page : 36
_extra : WOM-1
P: I'm now in reentry attitude. Standing by to
     go into automatic mode. Fly-by-wire tracks
     absolutely beautifully, just as it worked in
     the trainer. Very positive results from
     using the procedures trainer. There is no
     doubt about it, time does pass rather rapidly.
     Going back to automatic mode. I got pitch
     down signal, just a slight low thruster, and
     everything seems to be all right. This probably
     was a slight error in the corrected readout.
     I was right on, I believe, in all three axes.
     The capsule logic is working very well, and is
     tracking very well in reentry.

[00:01:06:50]
P: I will check my time as 1 plus 06 plus 50 seconds
     when I went into reentry attitude. The stars
     are very easy to see. I see quite a few, but
     am bothered by a considerable amount of red
     light. I, now, am going to devote some attention
     to the suit circuit for a minute or so.
     Then prepare to go back into retro attitude for
     Canton.

[00:01:07:28]
P: One definitely gets the illusion of looking way
     up above you at this attitude, and if there is
     no horizon, it's just a black sky. The amount
     of light in the cockpit is quite high. Once
     one gets adapted and it can be reduced, of
     course, by the cabin light. At this point, I
     am somewhat reluctant to reduce the light level
     in here, due to the problem with the suit
     circuit. I'm using my fingertip lights liberally.
     It is observed that in future flights, we must
     have some catch-all device that we can stuff
     objects into, and have them trapped there for
     a period of time. I'm driving at the problem
     of the washer and small crimped piece of metal.
     I . . . believe I finally got them stuffed into
     the little bag on the hatch. Suit temperature
     is just holding its own. I am hot, and
     probably will have to decrease the setting. I
     am sure I don't understand why the suit circuit
     takes so long to react. My cabin circuit works
     beautifully. I'm going to go back to fly-by-wire
     low; select retroattitude; and fly to retroattitude.

P: I'm now starting to see the sunrise in the
     periscope. First light in the periscope
     during this particular orbit as a result of
     the night side. It is obvious that the periscope
     has no function whatsoever in retroattitude
     on the night side. First light that I get is
     right now at a [glossary:CET] of practically [time:00:01:25:00|1 25 - 1 hour and 25 minutes]. The sunrise is coming in
     rather rapidly through the periscope.
     I do have the lighted objects that John
     mentioned, and I can create some by knocking
     them off. I definitely have a sensation of
     their being a field and varying in size from
     small to bright. The periscope itself is
     blinding me. I'll have to put the chart on
     it, so I can see out the window. I am in
     condition for retro at anytime, so I have
     nothing else to do but look out this window.
     Assuming that the suit circuit is satisfactory.
     That chart helps no end to cover up that
     blasted periscope. Quite a large field of these
     objects. Definitely is confirmed that you can
     knock them off the hatch, as Scotty said. And
     they stream off at, definitely there is no
     problem in judging that they are going away
     from the capsule, at a different rate than you
     are. They are definitely going slower, in
     velocity, than the capsule itself. One rap,
     and you can see them sliding aft. They are
     too small an object for photography. I would
     not even attempt to take a picture of them.
     Retroattitude is being held very well by the
     [glossary:ASCS]. I should be able to reach Guaymas by now.

     I think we might have a chance to take a quick

     Has this been apparent to you?

[00:01:38:01]
P: Negative. It has not. I have one case where
     I went into reeentry attitude after -
     correction, before - Canton but this was to
     check the stars at night after Woomera.
     And I got a twitch then, which I think was a
     high thruster.

     The window itself is satisfactory at (-)
     34 degrees, I've covered the gyro and am
     now coming back to the left to remove yaw.

[00:01:51:44]
CC: Roger. Did you, how far did you have to come
     back on yaw?

[00:01:51:48]
P: I am not there yet. I'd say about 25 to 30
     degrees, I'm stopping yaw at this time. The
     periscope checks with the window and the
     reticle and I'm going to give a mark shortly,
     to try to get all the rates stopped. I am
     just about in retroattitude now, and yaw
     looks real clean. I'm going to pull off and
     look. It's about 1 degree of yaw, to the
     right - MARK.<sup>T</sup>. Okay, I'm satisfied
     with that kind of day yaw check. That
     was done in retroattitude. I had a real good
     cloud layer, that was what was the cue.

[00:02:16:58]
P: At last we have solved the suit circuit
     temperature problem. I can see why Scott
     was concerned about this record position
     only. There is no side tone as well. The
     suit temperature at this time is - [glossary:CET]
     [time:00:02:17:20|2 17 20] MARK.<sup>T</sup> - is 68 degrees
     and I'm feeling marvelous. The suit dome is
     about 72 degrees again. Apparently, it does
     fluctuate, and we are going into the night
     side at this time. I believe we have the
     suit circuit under good control. I will go
     back to VOX push-to-talk. Standing by for
     Muchea at 25 (minutes). Gotta watch one
     sunset.

[00:02:17:55]
P: Sunset is rather striking, I don't think that
     I need to waste much time looking at them.
     They are very interesting. The other thing,
     it's fascinating is how black it is when your
     eyes are not adapted. I definitely can see
     some coating on the window. Going back to
     VOX at this point in UHF-hi to transmit.
     Opening visor to wipe off the right microphone.
     I licked it. Closing visor. Visor was sealed
     immediately for the suit circuit to go to work
     for me. I don't want to get fouled up with
     it again. The suit inlet is holding very
     nicely at about 68 (degrees). So the dome again
     is going to go back up. It's now up at 76, 75
     (degrees). Apparently this higher setting
     is the one we want. Think I'll put in another
     half a mark on that now and we may have her
     locked. She's getting kinda cool at last so
     I know where I want to go with the setting.
     I have set the coolant quantity for the suit
     and control lever at 8.5 at
     [time:00:02:19:28|2 hours 19 minutes, 28 seconds].
     The readout the dome
     at this time is 75 (degrees).
     The suit inlet is 68 (degrees). Very
     pleasant. I can feel cool air crossing
     my face. The oxygen quantity looks real
     good, 60 and 75 (psi, in hundreds).
     I have been watching the 250 inverter.
     It is approaching 140 degrees, and the
     150 contrast is down to about 100
     degrees. Standby is about 100 (degrees)
     which is cabin temperature. Thirdly,
     the 250 - that one's suffering, and I
     will keep an eye on it. Cabin heat
     exchanger is definitely settling out at
     40 degrees, and its given me a hard time
     because I obviously owe Frank Samonski
     50 cents. I'm pleasantly surprised.
     Cabin fuel too, is reading a little high.
     Let me see now, we're carrying 5.5 psi.
     it's reading about 5 point, correction,
     5.3, that's not too high for this cabin.
     It's getting nice and dark out, I think
     I'll take a peek out at the stars at
     this point. The cover for the battery
     for the flashlight on the left glove
     is coming loose. Only where - where
     the switch is, is no problem, just a
     case of wearing out before they should.

     to path. Just on the edge of the window, and
     that should give us 0 (degrees) yaw. I cannot
     see anything through the periscope that would
     help me. It is too - it is too cloudy. I'm

[00:02:24:15]
P: Okay, Gene, I'll give you the suit thing
     first so everybody is off the hook. We
     have a dome on the suit of 72, that is
     dome temperature (degrees). I have a
     suit inlet of 66 (degrees) on the suit and
     the suit setting is 8 and I am very happy
     with the suit circuit at this time. I am
     very comfortable.

[00:02:24:43]
CC: Roger. Cape advises they are very happy with
     the whole situation at this time. Particularly,
     the ECS systems solved itself, and they seem
     to think you have a good handle on the whole
     situation there.

[00:02:24:55]
P: Roger, I lost it for a while when I went back
     to the 3 setting, but I didn't stay there
     very long. It definitely should be about
     7-1/2 to 8. At this point, I am on [glossary:ASCS]
     auto retroattitude. I am going to go to
     fly-by-wire shortly. I had been on gyros
     normal, and maneuver has been off.
     All systems are green. I snapped off
     about 2 percent of manual (fuel) one time
     by hitting [glossary:RSCS]. It was double authority.
     It was my boo-boo. It was just one pitch
     down motion.

     yaw check on fly-by-wire low.

[00:02:25:42]
CC: Roger. We'll stand by.

[00:02:25:44]
P: Okay. Now I'm using the moon which is to
     the left of me, and it's a real good fix for
     it. I'm just gonna go ahead and cover up the
     attitude indicator and you can watch the yaw.
     I'm going to gyros free, trying to select
     to fly-by-wire low at this time. I'm gonna
     put the moon in the center of the window first -
     and holding roll and pitch and then put the
     moon back where it belongs. The moon is
     approaching the center of the window at this
     point. Okay, I'm gonna stop it there, and
     we'll put the roll control in to get that
     balanced out. Okay, at this point, I will
     get 0 roll. I have overshot the moon and am
     picking up the planet Mercury which is nice
     and bright, and that's a little bit far to
     the right. Now take a check off and we'll
     see how many degrees we've got here in yaw.
     About 20, which is enough for a quantitative
     check. We'll bring her back now. And I
     have to go ahead with slight roll motion each
     time I do this. This is to track the horizon
     naturally.

[00:02:27:06]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[00:02:27:11]
P: Okay, we're coming to the right as you may be
     able to see, and we're coming around very well.
     I still have to correct my roll out. Coming
     up on yaw attitude very shortly here. I'm
     quite satisfied with both day and
     night checks. I've been real pleased
     with it. I have to say this has been
     a real treat to see these bears flow
     into place.

     is now zero yaw. MARK.<sup>T</sup>.

     need to come right, the moon is right on the

     be holding up on my fuel minimum so I'll go
     ahead and play with it a little bit here. Okay,

     I'll slap her in and we'll have it made. Here
     comes roll to straighten her up. Coming up on
     roll - okay, I'm quitting right there. That's
     about as good as I'll ever give you. Little
     off in roll here. There we go. Now, that's

CC: Z Cal jumped down here and indicated high thrust.
     We think that was probably erroneous.

     noted it rather rapidly. I made one large
     thrust application in the flight so far,
     where I was going back from manual proportional
     to fly-by-wire and I forgot to
     move the rate command switch to auto. I had

P: Roger, Woomera.

CC: Sigma Seven, Woomera.

[00:02:36:36]
P: Go ahead, Woomera.

[00:02:37:38]
P: There's the old Corona Australis, shows in
     beautifully, and we've got Nunki. We've
     got Kaus Australis, and Nunki is right on
     the flight path where it belongs. I'm
     reading 0 yaw, 5 degrees left roll, in
     retroattitude. I sure would like to know
     why it's so complicated. And up above
     those boys I should pick up another brighty.
     That must be, has to be Altair. Very good.
     You actually get the feeling that you aren't
     really going over Australia on this flight.
     Okay. Now let's see, we finished yaw
     check for those boys, coming up on Canton.
     They get more [glossary:ASCS] than they reckoned for
     this time.

[00:02:38:53]
P: That's right, on HF at 3 plus 20, everything
     else is in order. Take another look at that
     dome there, over there. Suit temperature is
     64 (degrees) and I'm really happy.

[00:02:39:20]
P: T<sub>r</sub>-10 back to normal. I've done that earlier.
     Okay, we got - got suit pressure. Go ahead
     and take a look at the inverters again
     here. 250 is 141 (degrees), 150 is about
     107 (degrees). Well enough alone. Standby
     is . . . 7. Just about ambient. Negative,
     it's even a little . . .. The cabin pressure
     is about 5.3 (psi), which is perfect. Suit
     dome is 72 (degrees). Cabin dome is 45
     (degrees) and cabin is holding. Suit temperature
     is about 64 (degrees) and I like it.
     Oxygen is 60 (psi, in hundreds). Cabin O<sub>2</sub>
     is 5.3 (psi), and a complete electrical.

     or higher, ammeter is just about steady at
     20 amps. Wanted to check before we power
     down, [glossary:ASCS] is 115 (volts). Fans is about
     115 (volts), standby 0 (volts). Okay, the
     cockpit is clean. It's obvious that that

[00:02:45:39]

[00:02:45:44]

     get a good one this time.

P: I just have to move my elbow to the right,
     and I knock it.

[00:02:46:24]
CC: I see.

[00:02:46:28]
P: It's not critical. It's just a way of doing
     business. I had compared the night yaw checks
     over Muchea and Woomera, and am very satisfied
     with the results. With known objects it is
     absolutely no problem at all to acquire yaw.
     In addition, we can watch . . . down through
     the window.

[00:02:46:47]
CC: Roger, that's what I heard. I heard your report

[00:02:55:08]
CC: Do you see them close to you?

[00:02:55:11]
P: Oh, yeah, you can actually see relative motion,
     Gus. You can see them right by the window,
     then have them drifting way away. Looks like
     you see them way out because the velocity
     between you and fireflies is definite.

P: The attitudes check out very well. No doubt
     about it. Yaw can be seen with the periscope.
     And it can be acquired very rapidly. It can
     also be seen through the window without any

     sunrise, they come out the true firefly
     color you described.

     for example, now when I'm in the daylight and
     I rap it, I get white crystals which look like
     ice.

[00:03:00:53]
CC: Roger, got that all okay. Understand as
     described at first, and they got whiter as you
     go into better light.

[00:03:00:59]
P: Right, I've got white ones right now that are
     sort of drifting around. Look like little
     bits of frost.

     We just got the typical California

     believe.

[00:03:03:53]
CC: Roger. That's where Scott and I both
     picked up loud and clear over here.
     Seems to be always clear back in there.

P: Ha, Ha, Ha.

[00:03:04:44]
P: That's about as far north as I can see is the
     Salton Sea. You get a real good look at
     Baja California. And I probably can see
     Guaymas loud and clear, the way it seems.

[00:03:04:56]
CC: Looks like you have pretty good visibility
     today, if you see all that area.

[00:03:05:00]
P: Yeah, I can see just about as far as the
     Salton Sea north. I can see the Mt. Whitney
     area, but not much of it for the snow
     capped peaks that are just about on the
     horizon now.

[00:03:05:15]

P: No, this thing has, ah, practically no rates

     over, oh, probably 30 degrees to the left. -
     Pretty close to pitch attitude, and of course

     about, less than 0.1, exactly 0.04. I am

P: On the powering up. I went to gyros normal,
     finally, after getting gyros set at approximately
     three zeros with the maneuver off.
     There was no high thruster transition. Then,
     when I set up for three zeros, I did get a
     high thruster transition in the reentry
     select attitude. However, this is probably
     due to the no rate gyro run up case.

[00:03:52:41]
P: I am flying at three zeros on [glossary:ASCS] mode at
     this time, to see if this helps me reestablish.
     At approximately [time:00:04:00:00|4 hours], I just find out
     where I am as far as the moon goes.

[00:03:52:56]
P: Having little trouble getting stars oriented as
     to which ones they are, and this is going
     to be the problem. Particularly with two
     gadgets to hold in your hand for a computer.
     This doesn't help one bit.

[00:03:53:17]
P: There is a star that occurs at [time:00:03:53:00|3 hours and 53 minutes].
     What it is, is going to take a
     while to find out. Read the computer,
     set up, [time:00:03:53:00|3 hours and 53 minutes], and the

[00:04:08:29]
P: Roger. At this period, I'm looked ahead at
     the flight plan. I frankly feel that a lot
     more star information is needed, for nailing
     down attitudes - or a better computer. I'm
     rapidly working here when I shouldn't have
     to be.

[00:04:11:20]
P: At [time:00:04:11:00|4 11], it is 1 15 on the star chart computer, . . ..

[00:04:11:30]

[00:04:11:44]
P: I have Jupiter off on the right side, right
     corner of the window.

[00:04:12:07]
P: . . . Altair

[00:04:12:15]
P: I can see the double stars of Grus all forming
     a line - coming right into the center
     of the window. Jupiter, of course, is a
     real bright one. I can see Ankaa and -
     correction Al Naiir, and that, this must
     have been Peacock. Al Naiir is slightly
     to the right of the flight path. I'm
     flying, but that must be her. Jupiter
     shows up in the corner of the window.
     Proper head position, Formalhaut shows
     up to the right of flight path. Jupiter
     in the right corner. It checks at this
     time. Very nice.

P: . . ..

[00:04:15:58]
_page : 106

P: Don't tell me this compass is working? I
     should talk more. What I have been doing, I
     have been getting the standard source of
     light out. At this point, for the capsule,
     for my face because I am looking straight
     up at the compass is really rolling in the
     plane of the roll axis. I have a North
     pointing toward my right elbow. The compass
     definitely takes a swing when I moved

[00:04:17:32]
P: The compass is too much affected by the attitude
     instruments and gyros behind them.
     That's why I can't bring it to close to
     them. I am holding it just about halfway
     between the instrument panel and my face
     and in reference to a line halfway between
     the glove box and the pack. At the CE time
     of [time:00:04:18:00|4 18], it is pointing directly at the
     forward hatch clamp line. It seems that
     this is the restraining pin link for the
     hatch. I guess they can stow that for
     future reference.

[00:04:18:57]
P: . . . get rid of that for awhile.

[00:04:19:04]
P: We are on time [time:00:04:19:00|4 hours and 19 minutes]. On
     [glossary:ASCS] and I will pinch down. At this point,
     going to fly-by-wire low - to reentry
     attitude for Hawaii.

[00:04:19:35]
P: Selecting reentry attitude.

[00:04:19:45]
P: Always surprising when you finally see some
     object and the rate really shows up.

[00:04:20:09]
P: I am stopping the capsule in reentry attitude.
     Taking roll out. Yaw is zero; roll is
     coming out. I want to acquire this, and
     then watch it. Roll looks good. Pitch is
     coming in; yaw is coming in. Rates and
     attitude are good, . . . [glossary:ASCS] a little low
     thruster tweek and very nice. I will warm
     up the T<sub>r</sub>-10, gyros for their benefit. And
     starting to get some light on the scope,
     just barely.

P: I have a feeling I am off in pitch, but I think
     it is that damn horizon air glow line. Makes
     you think it's higher than it is. I still
     have the feeling though that I am pitched down
     about 10 degrees further than I want to be.
     If we are that close, we will let the scanner
     work on the problem.

P: I never had the direct opportunity of them
     coming toward me John, but they definitely
     were going away from me. I could get a
     big blast of them, either green fireflies
     or white ice crystals, by rapping on the
     capsule almost anytime.

[00:04:34:38]
CC: Roger. If you happen to have a chance at
     sunrise, anytime between now and end of
     flight, you might see whether you can see
     any coming toward you during that period
     also.

[00:04:34:47]

[00:04:38:02]
CC: Yeah. That's a pretty good setting from up
     there.

[00:04:38:04]
P: Yeah. . . . actually, I am looking north of
     the Salton Sea because of the yaw effect
     I must have in here. There is just a
     slight yawing effect just left of the
     capsule. Maybe about a quarter of a
     degree per second. Enough to bring me
     up towards the U.S.A.

P: I took picture 4, - 4a at [time:00:04:48:29|4 48 29], which is the
     coast of United States. I assume - I will
     have to look at my map shortly and see where we
     are. A rather large cloud mass at this point.
     We will stow the camera again. The drift
     rate isn't consistent enough that you can just
     take a picture and then put the camera away.
     Plus, the camera is a little hard to take
     out and put back in again.

[00:04:49:23]
P: At [time:00:04:50:00|4 hours and 50 minutes], I can't get that
     camera back out of that box again. Time to
     take a picture. Better stay in there for

P: The dome (temperature) is holding at 70 degrees.
     Cabin dome is 50 degrees. Suit inlet is
     comfortable at 62 (degrees). Suit pressure
     is steady at 5 psi. Very interesting cloud
     formation for picture 6b on the color back.
     Rather nice collection of circular clouds.

[00:04:52:46]
P: . . . shot at 250 56. (1/250 second at f 5.6).

[00:04:53:52]
P: At [time:00:04:53:53|04 53 53]. Bit of in a rolled over attitude
     with the nose fairly high. . . . the light
     value (setting) was 13.

[00:04:54:17]
P: I can actually see the little object that looked
     like a snowflake this time, going away from
     the capsule. In the same flight path, of
     course. Definitely, looked like a piece of
     white, but it is quite visible against the
     black sky that I see now. . . . the stars
     that go away from us. Definitely has a
     different velocity than the capsule itself.

[00:04:55:29]
P: [time:00:04:55:00|4 55] and still am sighting some of the snowflake
     effects. 250 inverter is now approximately
     135 degrees. Suit dome (temperature) is 72
     (degrees). The cabin dome is about 46 (degrees).

[00:04:56:47]
P: Sun right in view again. . . . that should be
     the proper yaw angle, approximately, because
     that's where the sun would be at sunset.

[00:04:57:02]
P: Coming up on [time:00:05:00:00|5 hours], so I'll be getting
     prepared to copy the intermediate report

P: Capsule is working very well at this point.

     right auto (thruster) is 110 (degrees), roll
     left auto (thruster) is 105 (degrees). Think

     5 6 (1/250 second and f5.6) roughly. Infinity
     is the setting.

[00:05:01:46]
P: Light value of 13 for that same subject. I
     shot at 13-½. Seems like a very low setting.

[00:05:03:00]
P: If I don't talk much more than this, it won't
     be very long to real time this tape recorder.
     Coming up on [glossary:IOS] at [time:00:05:15:00|5 hours and 15 minutes].
     Quite obvious that you don't care really
     what attitude you are in. There is always
     that concern about trying to get back into
     the attitude you must be in. Particularly,
     when you are coming around at the end of the
     third orbit to buy off on a go or no-go.

[00:05:04:20]
P: When I get much more I look at the earth. Rates
     at this time, having powered down at approximately
     [time:00:04:25:00|4 hours and 35 minutes] are almost exactly 0.
     There is a very, very slight pitch rate.
     Approximately maybe ½ degree per second.

[00:05:09:46]
P: At this point in time, which is of course just
     prior to sunset, we are coming up with a
     batch of the white particles. They show
     up in the blue sky. I have the horizon
     almost in sight. And they are drifting
     away from me.

[00:05:10:08]
P: Let's check and see if we actually do get yaw
     out of these. They are tending to go up in
     relation to me, rather than tending to draw
     away aft. With this kind of lighting I
     can really see the illusion of visibility,
     due to the external problem of having smoke
     on the outer panel. Definitely is not on
     inner panels. It is quite easy to see by
     changing panels through reflections that
     it's the outer panel.

[00:05:11:05]
P: We are now going into night coming up on [time:00:05:11:00|5 hours 11 minutes].
     Suit dome is setting at 7.0 very

P: I have some pretty stars in sight, and also I
     have the little white objects that seem to
     come from the capsule itself and drift off.
     If they are a yaw check it's fantastic. I
     suspect that the star I see is Arcturus. It
     would be very interesting - it is neither.
     It is one of the white objects . . . two
     stars are staying quite still. The white
     object actually looked like it came toward
     me, but it wasn't. I can actually see the
     particle now, flying off as John described it,
     as a lathe shaving. It's a very good description
     of it.

[00:05:12:39]
P: My rates are now just about 0 in all three axes.
     I still have light in the periscope, of course.
     I am looking straight up and yet at this point
     which is . . . , that my attitude is - let me get
     into the couch here. I really can't pick it
     too well, I am just about inverted at this
     point, and that my nose is above the horizon.
     As a result I notice that these particles
     keep tending aft of me, relative to me at
     any time.

[00:05:13:48]
P: Periscope is blacking out rather rapidly at
     sunset.

[00:05:13:57]
P: It is almost blacked out completely at this
     point. It is really not usable.

     the yaw attitude (indicator) at 270 degree

     Pleiades, Alvagrin. I'll look at Alvagrin
     and see what I can do with that.

[00:05:27:18]
P: I have extincted Alvagrin to read at [time:00:05:27:27|05 27 27].
     Now this experiment isn't going to be valuable;
     I need cabin lights to see. It's awfully hard
     to find the extinction photometer. Let's see
     if I can do it now. Contrasted Alvagrin, the

     is very bright.

[00:05:28:29]
P: I'll put the photometer in an area where it may
     be available again. At [time:00:05:28:48|05 28 48], the rates are
     almost exactly-negative-yaw is 0; pitch is

     some more data in here. Gathered at

CC: You're loud and clear. Everything's solid down
     here. I guess you got the word on the [time:00:06:08:00|6 08]
     bit. Is that affirm?

[00:06:06:14]
P: That's affirmative. You have [glossary:T/M] on me now?
     I'll power up before all that jazz.

[00:06:06:20]
CC: Okay, Roger. [glossary:T/M] is solid.

[00:06:06:21]
P: Okay. I have gyros normal, auto, gyros caged.
     I am going to power up and then go - correction -
     gonna power up and fly-by-wire. Monitoring the
     a-c bus at this time. She comes up to 115
     (volts). I have 25 amps, in good shape.

[00:06:06:45]
CC: Roger. We confirm.

[00:06:06:47]
P: I'll hold off on my beacon. Clock's at [time:00:06:06:00|6 06]
     approximately I guess, when I powered up, so
     that it would be good at about [time:00:06:11:00|6 11]. I have
     no change in consumables, John. It looks real
     good here.

P: Roger. I got a real weird attitude at this

     down at the earth. I'm sort of coming toward
     you head first, inverted.

[00:06:07:23]
CC: Roger. You can pick your own up from that
     standpoint.

[00:06:07:26]
P: Yeah. You really get the illusion you're

     don't you?

[00:06:07:33]
CC: Right.

[00:06:07:40]
CC: Wally, I'll give you a count to the [time:00:06:08:00|6 08] here
     so we . . . start in. They're going to have it
     on for 2 minutes beginning at [time:00:06:08:00|6 08]. That's
     about 20 seconds, here.

[00:06:07:46]
P: Okay, John, sounds like fun.

[00:06:08:04]
CC: Okay, Sigma Seven. This is Cal Cap Com. You're

     Wally.

[00:06:08:10]
P: Roger, John. Just came out of the powered down
     configuration where we had the [glossary:ASCS] inverter
     off. It came up in good shape and will stay
     on now for the rest of the flight. The amps
     and volts are reading properly. The amps are
     now down to about 19 amps, after we powered
     up. They were up to 25 at first. I'm coming
     toward you inverted this time, which is an
     unusual way for any of us to approach
     California, I'll admit.

[00:06:08:44]
CC: Roger, Wally, you got anything to say to everyone,
     watching you across country on this thing. We're
     going out live on this.

[00:06:08:50]
P: That sounds like great sport, I can see why you
     and Scott like it. I'm having a trick now. I'm
     looking at the United States and starting to pitch
     up slightly with this drifting rate. And I see
     the moon, which I'm sure no one in the United
     States can see as well as I right now.

     at this point I don't have a chance to dream.
     I'm enjoying it too much.

[00:06:09:22]
CC: Things are looking real good from here, Wally.

[00:06:09:24]

     across the United States.

[00:06:09:37]
CC: Roger. Wally, have you had a chance to observe
     a haze layer any?

[00:06:09:42]
P: Yes, I have. It's quite fascinating; in fact,
     it's misleading in the evening. Gives you the
     feeling that you are pitched down quite far.
     Have you noticed that?

[00:06:09:54]
CC: Roger.

[00:06:09:55]

[00:06:10:58]
P: Roger, Scott. I am in drifting flight, but I have
     powered up the [glossary:ASCS] a-c bus. It has come on the
     line very well. I will power up the beacons
     later. The control mode selected is fly-by-wire
     although I'm not controlling in it. The auto
     switch is auto, gyros switch is still caged.
     The reentry attitude is selected, maneuver is
     off. The quantities are all in the green.
     Suit temperature is about 60 (degrees). I'm
     quite comfortable with it. Electrical is green
     and a-c is green.

[00:06:11:47]
CC: Roger, and could we have one more blood pressure,

P: This is Sigma Seven on VOX record only. I have
     reestablished auto mode in normal with no high
     thruster action. At this point I have 85
     percent auto, 90 percent manual. And I
     feel, now that I am on [glossary:ASCS], I can do some
     experiments where before I was not able to.
     I will now pitch the capsule down on fly-by-wire
     low. First I will check to see -
     if I turn on my beacons, nobody down here
     can get to me on those. At [time:00:06:25:00|6 hours and 25 minutes]
     - if anybody has a beacon in
     South America they deserve to hear it.
     Beacons are on, for a good 3 amps. Opening

P: Closing visor. Okay. Let's take a look and
     see where we are. At this point we made
     a dosimeter check. I will pitch down on
     fly-by-wire to reentry attitude. Now let's
     give it a manual proportional go this time.

[00:06:27:37]
P: In manual proportional, with manual lever
     pulled out, and having selected rate command.
     I'm slowly but surely coming into retroattitude.
     All axes are working very well.
     Setting up in roll. Getting yaw rates, pow,
     pow. And I want this to count - I'm going
     to go back to fly-by-wire low.

P: That was stupid. Now we go to fly-by-wire
     low. I had a case of double authority and
     really flotched it. But better conserve
     our fuel. It's much too easy to get into
     double authority, even with the tremendous
     logic you have working on all these systems.
     The pitch is in; yaw is in; selecting
     reentry attitude; roll is in; going to [glossary:ASCS],
     reentry now. And she's in.

[00:06:29:58]
P: Okay. I think we can change backs, and get
     some weather bureau pictures if it's
     possible. Shoot up the rest - the rest of
     these, just lightly. That's A 10 at [time:00:06:30:00|6+30 hours],
     and 11 is coming up, and [time:00:06:30:00|6+30 hours]
     with a cloud bank off to the left. Okay.
     I'll get the plate back on, and save this

     up over [glossary:IOS] for 6+50, in the night, and
     this time I want to go down the star charts
     to check this bear out. That is why I
     am on [glossary:ASCS].

[00:06:42:27]
P: Had the fun with experimenting and now will
     get the fun of being ready for reentry at

     at [time:00:06:40:00|6 40]. [time:00:06:40:00|6 40]. . . . same as 0 52.

[00:06:44:03]
P: There is a nice interesting horizon. The
     sun is off to the left about - oh I'd say
     40 degrees. There's a dark line of the
     surface of the earth, orange at the clouds -
     a light yellow, a light white and a blue
     band. A very light blue and I have the
     Planet Mercury in sight at this point.
     Before the sun has set. And it's in the
     proper position.

[00:06:44:37]
P: Describing the blue band. There's a
     relatively dark blue band right at the
     surface of the earth, and a light blue
     band, and another dark blue band, and a
     large white band which is the air glow,
     and then a deep black one and sorta goes
     from a grayish blue in to a dense black.
     Almost looks like underneath a rain cloud
     as far as the transition from the blue
     band to the total darkness.
     And I'll bring up my fingertip lights. And
     at [time:00:06:45:52|06 45 52] Mercury is right on the horizon.
     Arcturus should be in view, but I guess we
     we can't get her.

     of it. MARK,<sup>T</sup> the first change
     of color, which is now a light blue. And
     it's still visible. MARK,<sup>T</sup> a

P: Okay, it looks like we are getting some lighted
     areas over the southern tip of Africa. I
     definitely have a city in sight, and - this
     is Sigma Seven. On transmit, I've had on
     VOX record only. I definitely have a city
     in sight in Africa. It first showed up at

     Thaurus is coming right down through the
     center line. Could yaw right about 5
     degrees which would satisfy dead reckoning.
     Then roll left about 5 (degrees) which is
     quite graphic. For retro, this looks like
     a very good set-up. Be no problem at all
     flying attitude here with the moon bright
     . . . light which would be dawn's light.
     Occasionally you can see a ground light,
     particularly, along the island chain at

     capsule is prepared for retrosequence but
     for stowing two charts. I'm sure we're go.
     I have 81 percent auto, (fuel) 80 percent

P: At this time, I have completed the high
     thruster checks. A delayed report. Each
     axis worked beautifully. I now have 75 (percent)
     auto (fuel) and 75 (percent) manual (fuel).

[00:08:35:41]
P: All attitudes are responding very nicely. Suit
     heat dome is about 72 (degrees), suit inlet is
     about 63 (degrees), coming down just a tad.
     Definitely it - optimum flight setting of about
     7½ to 8 for this vehicle. I will crack it up
     another notch to 8. I have set the - suit
     regulator for the coolant quantity to position 8,
     at [glossary:CET] [time:00:08:36:23|08 36 23].

[00:08:36:35]
P: That's a more accurate reading on fuel if I can
     get my fingers up to it would be 78, 78 (percent)
     - prior to retro. I am set up to have retro
     performed - automatic control - subsequent to
     retro - I will switch to fly-by-wire and pitch
     up to reentry axis - correction - subsequent to
     retro jettison, switch to fly-by-wire, pitch up
     reentry attitude and select rate command at 08
     . . ..

[00:08:40:35]
P: Cabin, at this time, is monitoring at about 4.8
     (psi). The suit apparently about 4 (psi), and
     the suit pressure gage is reading 4.9 (psi). This
     is the suit pressure gage on the suit.

[00:08:41:03]
P: The index finger - finger-tip light left hand
     finally failed. They really do not have the long-time
     durability that we're looking for.

[00:08:41:19]
P: The horizon is very clear. Roll and pitch look
     very good. Yaw looks good. I believe we've got
     a medley of stars coming into sight now to give
     us a fix.

[00:08:41:37]
P: One gets the illusion that you're on a train or
     some other vehicle, due to the humming, and you
     feel that you should be on a track of some kind
     and you're driving down. Much like the sound of
     the ship when you're under way at sea. The
     blower noise, I assume, and the inverters give
     you the same illusions

[00:08:42:14]

P: Okay. We got Grus, and we got Jupiter in the right
     position. So our yaw reference is right on the
     money. No problem with that. When I lean way
     down I can pick up Jupiter, and Formalhaut should
     come down very shortly after.

[00:08:42:36]
P: Have a slight roll to the right, which is indicated
     by the gyro as well. Coming on 8 minutes and
     50 seconds.

[00:08:43:24]
P: T<sub>r</sub>-10 relay must have set in, although I have no
     clues - other than the [glossary:ASCS] rate gyros coming up
     and I can't bet on those since they're in anyway
     by the switch being selected to T<sub>r</sub>-10 bypass.

[00:08:43:49]
P: Gyros normal. Attitude - fly-by-wire. Retrofire
     armed, the 3 fuses are armed. We are fat!

[00:08:44:04]
P: There is Jupiter,and there is Formalhaut in the
     middle of the window, this time around. Attitude
     is real stiff now. Just by chance, I assume.
     Roll is right on, yaw is right on.

[00:08:44:41]
P: Cabin PO<sub>2</sub> at this time is about 3.9 to 4.0 (psi).
     Cabin heat exchanger is about 50 (degrees), at this

     Five degrees roll shows up very readily.

P: Checking over the other systems. They all seem to
     be fairly constant. Suit dome is still about
     71 (degrees), suit inlet is 62 (degrees), which
     this time is comfortable. Cabin pressure and suit
     pressure and suit pressure gauge all match within
     about 1/10 of a psi. Getting some light in the

P: Roger. Understand.

[00:08:59:50]
CC: Sigma Seven. I'll keep on talking in the hope
     that we can clear this blackout problem.
     At 17K, your O<sub>2</sub> emergency light should come

P: I have selected aux damp and rate command at

     It would be impossible to see out of it at
     this point.

[00:09:01:38]
P: I'm seeing things come off, but I can't see them
     very clearly. There we go into 0.05, a green.
     I am hands off at this point. In rate command,
     in aux damp. And I have a roll rate started.
     A slight pitch rate, not bad at all. I can see
     out the window for some strange reason at last.
     There goes another long spiral like looking
     device. I will give another blood pressure at
     this point, subsequent to 0.05 g. All rates
     are very nominal. Rate command is working quite
     well I would say.

[00:09:02:44]
P: Going back into g-field. And the attitude looks
     very stable. I'm rolling right around the
     horizon. I'm going to stop my blood pressure
     at this time - and sit back here and regroup.
     I can see the ion layer. I'm inverted at this
     time.

[00:09:03:14]
P: Attitudes are controlling very well. Seems to
     be plenty of manual fuel. I'm still at 72
     percent. Definitely has the cyclic rate in
     pitch at this point. Yaw is fairly stiff; g
     is building up. Capsule is quite stable.
     There is a green flow - and looks like orange
     streaks every once in a while. [glossary:RSCS] is doing
     very well on reentry. Rather unusual slow
     roll. Building up to 2g's. I have plenty of
     fuel in rate command. Seeing sparkles coming
     by now. A definite green glow, like a limeade;
     g's building up. Oscillations are very good at
     this point. About 3g.

     Coming up on 45,000. I'm down to about

     Snorkle should go. I believe snorkle lid

     chute. Okay I've got that darn visor hose
     off, and the Velcro strap loose. Visor seal is
