Although in some ways not as ambitious as Gagarin's orbital flight, Shepard's mission both included manual control of the spacecraft, and saw the pilot land safely in the Mercury capsule.\n\nThis site allows you to explore transcripts of radio communications between Alan Shepard aboard Freedom 7 and the NASA personnel back in Florida, along with photographs taken both from the ground and in space.",
