     toward the real horizon. It would appear to be possibly some 7 or 8 degrees
     wide. I can see the clouds down below it; then a dark band, then a lighter band
     that the stars shine right through as they come down toward the horizon. I can

     mass of some very small particles, that are brilliantly lit up like they're 
     luminescent. I never saw anything like it. They round a little; they're coming by
     the capsule, and they look like little stars. A whole shower of them coming by.

[00:01:15:57]
P: They swirl around the capsule and go in front of the window and they're all brilliantly lighted. They probably average maybe 7 or 8 feet apart, but I can see
     them all down below me, also.

[00:01:16:06]
CC: Roger, Friendship Seven. Can you hear any impact with the capsule? Over.

[00:01:16:33]
P: They do, they do have a different motion, though, from me because they swirl
     around the capsule and then depart back the way I am looking.

     I had literally thousands of small, luminous particles swirling around the capsule
     and going away from me at maybe 3 to 5 miles per hour. Now that I am out in
     the bright sun, they seem to have disappeared. It was just as the sun was coming

CC: Friendship Seven, Cap Com. Would you give us the difficulty you've been having
     in yaw in ASCS? Over.

[00:01:33:52]
P: Roger. This is Friendship Seven. I'm going on fly-by-wire so I can control more
     accurately. It just started as I got to Guaymas, and appears to be it drifts off
     in yaw, to the right at about 1° per second. It will go over to an attitude of
     about 20°, and hold at that and when it hits about a 20° point it then goes into
     orientation mode and comes back to zero, and it was cycling back and forth in
     that mode. I am on fly-by-wire now and controlling manually. Over.

CC: That is affirmative. Standby one, please.

[00:01:35:27]

     [percent], oxygen 62-95 [percent], amps are 25. All systems are still go. I have
     had some erratic [glossary:ASCS|ASCS] operation. I caged and uncaged on the night side and it
     appears to be working fairly well now although I was drifting again in roll a
     moment ago. It appears to have corrected itself in roll, however, without me
     caging again now. Over.

[00:02:59:17]
CC: Good, John. We have a go all the way on this. I'd like to give you your inverter
     temperatures. Your fans are 215 [degrees], your [glossary:ASCS|ASCS] 198 [degrees]. We're
     not going to do anything about them. Looks real good.

P: Roger. I appear to have a little bit of drift in the scope yet though.

[00:03:00:19]
CC: Roger. You probably don't have a good reference yet, do you?

[00:03:00:22]
P: It's rather, it's more difficult to pick up drift than I thought it would be. Your
     best drift really is to look out the window and try and get something moving
     away from you out the window.

[00:03:00:36]
CC: Roger, I've got you there.

     not, the attitude indicators are showing orbit attitude but it's not. By looking
     out at the horizon, I am about 20° right in roll and 20° too much on pitch down.

     That's 3 plus 44.

[00:03:44:45]
P: This is Friendship Seven. An observation on control system operation: It appears
     that whenever I go off on manual, or fly-by-wire and maneuver for any lengthy
     period of time, that somehow we induce considerably, considerable errors into the
     gyro system. I come up with all kinds of attitudes. That time for instance,
     when I yawed around 180°, and held for a little while, and came back again,
     I had errors of 30° in roll, 35 [degrees] in yaw and plus 40 [degrees] in pitch.

[00:03:45:23]
P: This is Friendship Seven, going on manual pitch.

[00:03:46:08]
_extra : INDIAN OCEAN SHIP (THIRD ORBIT)
P: This is Friendship Seven. Several times I have felt that I had a partially stuck
     thruster or one that was just partly operating in pitch down and just then again
     I had a pitch up rate going and all at once I felt a down thrust and it pitched down
     on me. Again there, it repeated again that time, so I think I have a stuck pitch
     thruster occasionally.

CC: Roger. You are coming through rather weak. Do you want to switch to UHF?
     Over.

[00:03:58:13]
P: Roger. Switching to UHF.

P: Hello, Muchea, Friendship Seven. Loud and clear, how me? Over.

[00:03:58:38]
CC: Muchea Cap Com. Give us 30-minute report.

[00:03:58:43]
P: Roger. This is Friendship Seven. 30-minute report: [glossary:ASCS|ASCS] is major item, still
     not operating properly. I am on fly-by-wire at present time. I have no low thrust
     to the right fly-by-wire. Over.

[00:03:58:58]
CC: Roger, understand no low right thruster on fly-by-wire.

[00:03:59:02]
P: That is affirmative. Got it?

[00:03:59:06]
CC: We would like to send you a Z and R Cal sometime during your 30-minute
     report. ...

[00:03:59:11]
P: Roger. Fine.

[00:03:59:13]
CC: You want to start down the 30-minute report there?

[00:03:59:16]
P: This is Friendship Seven. In 45 more seconds I would like to have you send a
     message for me, please. Over.

[00:03:59:23]
P: I want you to send a message to the Director, to the Commandant, U.S. Marine
     Corps, Washington. Tell him I have my 4 hours required flight time in for the
     month and request flight chit be established for me. Over.

[00:03:59:39]
CC: Roger. Will do.

[00:03:59:47]
CC: Think they'll pay it?

[00:03:59:49]
P: I don't know. Gonna find out.

[00:03:59:51]
CC: Roger. Is this flying time or rocket time?

[00:03:59:53]
P: Lighter than air, buddy.

[00:03:59:59]
CC: Rog.

[00:04:00:03]
CC: We're sending you a Z and R Cal, hear.

[00:04:00:07]
P: Very well.

[00:04:00:09]
CC: Coming now.

[00:04:00:11]
CC: Are you going to start down on this procedure, or this 30-minute stuff?

[00:04:00:15]
P: Yes, all the fuse switches are still in the same position, Gordo. I haven't changed
     any of those. Squib is armed, Auto Retrojettison is off. I am on fly-by-wire,
     auto, and gyro normal. All "T" handles are in. The sequence panel is normal
     except for Landing Bag in the off position. The attitude indicator has been
     rather erratic, they drift very rapidly sometimes. Especially when I maneuver
     myself and then come back onto [glossary:ASCS|ASCS]. It seems they have been thrown way
     off at that time.

[00:04:00:51]
CC: Roger.

[00:04:00:53]
P: My retrograde time 04 plus 32 plus 38 for capsule time which corrects for I second
     error in this clock.

[00:04:01:09]
CC: On that, [glossary:MCC|MCC] recommends you change that to [time:00:04:32:37|04 32 37] shortly after you get
     done with these others.

[00:04:01:14]
P: Roger. Okay, cabin pressure is still holding at 5.5. It's been there ever since we
     left. 90 [percent] on cabin temp, relative humidity is back up again now to
     about 36 [percent], coolant quantity is down a little bit too, we may have had
     a small water leak some place since we have that much increase in humidity,
     cause it was down around 20 [percent]. Our coolant quantity, though, is down
     around 62 [percent] now. The suit temperature is 70 [degrees] inlet; cabin
     suit pressure is 5.8. Steam temperature is 4 point, is 48 [degrees]. Oxygen is
     60-90 [percent]. Amps are 24, [glossary:ASCS|ASCS] is 11, about 115 now. Fan, is 110. Over.

[00:04:02:10]
CC: Roger. All your switches outboard?

[00:04:02:13]
P: That's affirmative. On the right side, everything is outboard except the fuel
     quantity warning light which is on. I have that switch inboard to cut the
     audio.

[00:04:02:22]
_page : 184
P: The only 2 switch fuses in the center off position, on the right, are Retro Jettison and Retro Manual. Over.

[00:04:02:29]
CC: Roger. Comfort control settings?

[00:04:02:32]
P: Control settings on the water?

[00:04:02:36]
CC: Rog.

[00:04:02:44]
P: Water on, on cabin temperature is setting number 2. Setting on the suit temp is
     beyond the 1.7 mark. I repeat, beyond the 1.7 mark which is the maximum setting.

[00:04:02:55]
CC: Roger. I understand. What is your opinion on the gyro problem, John?

[00:04:03:00]
P: Well, I don't know. I want to start lining up just as carefully as I can here in
     a minute and see whether the scanners will pick it up and correct it in so that
     we have a good retrofire attitude. If it is not, I'll aline it myself. Over.

[00:04:03:12]
CC: Roger. Do you have your three Dog, Easy, and Hotel times from Indian Ocean
     Ship?

[00:04:03:17]
P: Yes I did. I got these okay.

[00:04:03:19]
CC: And, now I gave you the recommended change in the retro clock to [time:00:04:32:37|04 32 37].
     On your retro, using [glossary:ASCS|ASCS], you'll be using high torque thrusters for retrofire
     mode there. What do you say about retroing by [glossary:ASCS|ASCS] and backing up by
     fly-by-wire?

[00:04:03:36]
P: Well-well, you can't, you couldn't do it on [glossary:ASCS|ASCS] and fly-by-wire. You mean on
     manual.

[00:04:03:43]
CC: No, I meant you could go [glossary:ASCS|ASCS] by fly-by-wire and back it up on manual proportional.

[00:04:03:48]
P: Yes. If the [glossary:ASCS|ASCS] appears to be programing and holding a good orbit attitude
     I'll let it go on [glossary:ASCS|ASCS] and back it up with manual. If not, if it appears that the
     gyros are cocked as they were a little while ago, then I'll just stay on manual
     retrofire, I think and let it go at that.

[00:04:04:07]
CC: Are you in manual proportional or fly-by-wire now?

[00:04:04:10]
P: I'm in fly-by-wire now.

[00:04:04:21]
_extra : WOOMERA (THIRD ORBIT)
P: This is Friendship Seven. I am going to as near orbit attitude as I can establish
     here on the dark side.

P: This is Friendship Seven. Turning more water on on that one, see if I can cool it
     down a little more.

[00:04:07:30]
P: This is Friendship Seven. I can notice a little crackling on fly-by-wire switches
     when I operate fly-by-wire; it comes in on the head set.

[00:04:13:41]
P: This is Friendship Seven. Turned around, yawed 180 [degrees] to see the sunrise
     here, and also to see these little, these little gadgets here that I don't know what
     they are.

CC: Friendship Seven, we have been reading an indication on the ground of segment 51,
     which is Landing Bag Deploy. We suspect this is a erroneous signal. However,
     Cape would like, you to check this by putting the Landing Bag switch in auto
     position, and see if you get a light. Do you concur with this? Over.

[00:04:23:09]
P: Okay. If that's what they recommend, we'll go ahead and try it. Are you ready
     for it now?

[00:04:23:16]

     respect to the visual reference, how you feel about this at this time?

[00:04:25:28]
_page : 186
P: Well, it's into, it's in and out of orientation mode right now and is wasting fuel, in yaw. I may have to cut it in yaw, I don't know. It appears to be correcting,
     though, at the present time or maybe the scanners are correcting it okay now.

CC: Good head.

[00:04:34:28]
P: I'll tell you, there is no doubt about it when the retros fire.

[00:04:34:32]
CC: Gathered that from your comments.

CC: Looks pretty good on this end. How did the attitude seem to hold? Did you
     have any diversions in yaw at all?

[00:04:35:21]
P: Negative, very close. I backed it up and worked right along with the [glossary:ASCS|ASCS] and
     it looked like it held right on the money.

[00:04:35:27]
CC: Roger, we didn't notice any particular disparity here.

[00:04:35:29]
P: Roger, good. Do you have a time for going to Jettison Retro? Over.

[00:04:35:35]
P: Roger.

[00:04:35:39]

     it keeps banging in and out of orientation.

P: Yes, sir

[00:04:36:28]
P: This is Friendship Seven Can see El Centre and the Imperial Valley down there;
     Salton Sea very clear.

[00:04:36:37]
P: Yes, sir.

[00:04:36:47]
CC: Do you notice any contrast over the coastline, John?

CC: How about contrast over the coastline?

[00:04:36:53]
P: Negative.

[00:04:36:55]
CC: Roger.

[00:04:36:59]
P: There is quite a bit of cloud cover down in this area. I can, right on track, I can
     only see certain areas. I can see quite a bit on up to the north, however.

[00:04:37:16]
P: This is Friendship Seven, going to manual control.

[00:04:37:19]
CC: Roger, Friendship Seven.

P: Roger, Texas, go ahead.

[00:04:38:11]
CT: Roger. Reading you 5 square. Standby for Texas Cap Com.

[00:04:38:14]
P: Roger.

[00:04:38:23]
CC: This is Texas Cap Com, Friendship Seven. We are recommending that you leave
     the retropackage on through the entire reentry. This means that you will have
     to override the 0.05g switch which is expected to occur at [time:00:04:43:53|04 43 53]. This also
     means that you will have to manually retract the scope. Do you read?

[00:04:38:47]
P: This is Friendship Seven. What is the reason for this? Do you have any reason?
     Over.

[00:04:38:51]
CC: Not at this time; this is the judgment of Cape Flight.

[00:04:38:56]
P: Roger. Say again your instructions please. Over.

[00:04:38:59]
CC: We are recommending that the retropackage not, I say again, not be jettisoned.
     This means that you will have to override the 0.05g switch which is expected
     to occur at [time:00:04:43:53|04 43 53]. This is approximately 4¼ minutes from now. This
     also means that you will have to retract the scope manually. Do you understand?

[00:04:39:23]
P: Roger, understand. I will have to make a manual 0.05g entry when it occurs, and
     bring the scope in manually. Is that affirm?

[00:04:39:33]
CC: That is affirmative, Friendship Seven.

[00:04:39:37]
P: Roger.

[00:04:39:40]
P: This is Friendship Seven, going to reentry attitude, then, in that case.

[00:04:39:58]
CC: Friendship Seven, Cape flight will give you the reasons for this action when you
     are in view.

[00:04:40:04]

CC: While you're doing that, we are not sure whether or not your landing bag has
     deployed. We feel it is possible to reenter with the retropackage on. We see
     no difficulty at this time in that type of reentry. Over.

[00:04:40:49]
