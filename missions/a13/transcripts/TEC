     a nice color TV picture now. If you have any
     commentary to go with it.

[00:01:41:31]
CMP: Okay, Joe. I'll tell you, I'm just trying to
     figure out where we are here.

[00:01:41:40]
CC:  That's your job, not mine.

[00:01:41:43]
CMP: You know, I've just been up out of the [glossary:LEB] for
     a short time here, and I'm trying to find out
     which country we're over.

[00:01:41:52]
CDR: I have to keep telling Jack that the blue stuff
     down there is water.

CC:  I'll give you a hint. You're in the western
     hemisphere.

[00:01:42:10]
CMP: Okay, Joe. It appears like that we've crossed
     out into the Gulf of Mexico here, and I've got
     a peninsula or an island that's down there. I
     don't know whether you can see it.

[00:01:42:34]
CC:  Roger, Jack. We see that. Of course, there's
     a lot of cloudcover and you see it more clearly
     than we do, but it does look like the Earth, not
     the Moon.

[00:01:42:58]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston. We've had [glossary:LOS] [glossary:MILA] now.
     Thank you very much.

[00:01:48:11]
CC:  Okay. The computer is yours, Jim.

[00:01:48:14]
CDR: Thank you, - -

[00:01:48:16]
CC:  And you are GO for [glossary:TLI]. Huntsville reports
     that you have a 6-second propellant pad which is
     3 seconds more than a 3-sigma case; so you're
     good on consumables. The [glossary:IU] is so good that
     we're not going to update it. The only change
     we have for you is in the [glossary:TLI] checklist. At
     57 minutes where you slew the [glossary:FDAI] to 18 degrees,
     we recommend 20 degrees there, and we recommend
     that you look for 8 degrees instead of 6 degrees
     at ignition. The [glossary:S-IVB] is riding on the top of
     its deadband.

[00:01:48:56]
CDR: - - Understand; and just out of curiosity, was that
     engine out to use up more [glossary:S-IVB] fuel?

[00:01:49:03]
CC:  The engine out did cause you to use more [glossary:S-IVB]
     fuel - about a 10-second-longer burn; but you're
     still GO.

[00:01:49:12]
_page : 20

     ready.

[00:01:49:36]

     and all indications are nominal. We're down to
     PYRO ARM now and we're getting ready.

     everything still looks good to us.

[00:02:25:53]
CMP: Hey, Joe. At 2 hours and 12 minutes, the O<sub>2</sub> FLOW
     HIGH light came on, and it's been pegged high
     ever since, so it's been on about 14 minutes now.

     with the WASTE TANK VENT open at this time, and
     it's no sweat.

[00:02:27:05]

[00:02:27:08]
CC:  Okay. We did.

[00:02:27:11]
CMP: Thank you.

[00:02:31:22]

     plus 01769, and DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> was minus 3.0.

[00:02:46:37]

     How about the burn time? Did you notice?

[00:02:46:42]
CDR: Okay. On my trusty watch, I had about
     3-3/4 seconds long.

[00:02:46:49]

[00:03:15:12]
LMP: Roger. I'm going to be moving the TV to get a

     here?

[00:03:21:49]

[00:03:24:24]
CC:  Okay. With the direct sunlight from the window,
     out of the TV camera field as it is now, we'd
     like you to open it up an f-stop or so and, if
     convenient, try to keep that bright spot out of
     the window.

[00:03:24:40]
LMP: Okay.

[00:03:26:14]
CC:  13, Houston. I guess we could stand one more
     twick down on the f-stop.

[00:03:26:24]
CMP: Okay, Joe. He's going to do it.

[00:03:26:26]

[00:03:30:11]

     the tunnel.

[00:03:30:46]
CC:  Houston; Roger.

[00:03:31:47]
LMP: ... probably hear, Joe, we're just finishing
     pumping up Aquarius here.

[00:03:31:54]
CC:  Okay. About all we see on this picture, Fred,
     are the bright spots with the lights around the
     tunnel area. The hatch itself is pretty dark.

[00:03:31:57]
CC:  13, Houston. By the way, we'd like to know how
     the high gain antenna lockup worked. Our signal
     strength is a little bit lower than we thought
     it would be.

[00:03:33:06]
CMP: It looked just the way I expected it to, Joe. I
     had her sitting there in REACQ with the numbers
     cranked in and soon as we got pretty much through
     the rotation, I just threw it down to HIGH GAIN
     and it appeared to lock right up.

[00:03:33:24]
_page : 29

CC:  Okay. Good deal. See that flashlight beam
     wandering around in there.

[00:03:33:45]
LMP: Houston, 13.

[00:03:35:47]
CC:  13, Houston. Go ahead.

[00:03:35:50]
LMP: We'd kind of like to hold off on the - start the
     venting again until we get the things - pumped
     back up inside here. Wonder if you might give us
     a call to remind us when to initiate that.

[00:03:36:06]
CC:  Okay, 13; will do.

[00:03:36:26]
LMP: And we'll try to shift her up to look up into the
     tunnel here.

[00:03:36:31]
CC:  Okay. Real good.

[00:03:36:54]
CC:  Okay, 13; Houston. I think we could use an
     f-stop lower. What f-stop are you in now?

[00:03:37:03]
LMP: I'm about as low as you can go, Joe. I'm sitting
     on 4.4.

[00:03:37:06]
CC:  Okay.

[00:03:37:18]
LMP: What you're looking at, Joe, is the commander
     has removed the hatch and is proceeding to stow
     it.

[00:03:38:06]
CC:  Okay, 13. That's a pretty good picture there.

[00:03:38:14]
LMP: The CDR is verifying the docking latches now.

[00:03:38:17]
CC:  Roger.

[00:03:38:25]
CMP: Hey, Joe. Jim reports that there's a slight, you
     know, burn smell up in the tunnel area, as been
     reported on previous flights.

[00:03:38:34]
CC:  Okay. We copy that.

[00:03:39:06]
CMP: Okay. The commander reports all docking latches
     latched.

[00:03:39:11]
CC:  Houston; Roger.

[00:03:42:08]
CC:  13, Houston. For your information, the [glossary:S-IVB]
     vent is proceeding on schedule.

CMP: Okay, Joe.

[00:03:42:20]
LMP: Yes, Joe. That's - That's concurring with all
     the thousands of particles that I see going by
     outside here.

[00:03:42:30]
CC:  Yes. I guess I didn't need to tell you.

[00:03:44:16]
CC:  13, it looks like Jim is connecting the umbilical
     at this time. Is that right?

[00:03:44:21]
LMP: Yes, that's affirm - affirm, Joe. Do you have
     any detail up in there at all? On the monitor
     it looks like I can - I can make out the drogue -
     the drogue a little bit, but not much else.

[00:03:44:34]
CC:  We can see the probe pretty well, and we can see
     his hands quite well there.

[00:03:46:03]
CC:  Okay, Roger that.

     out the left side, Joe.

LMP: Okay. You making out the picture there, Joe?

[00:03:48:07]
CC:  Yes. Is that the world?

[00:03:48:19]
CC:  Okay, Fred. That's pretty nice looking picture.
     We'd like to know what settings you used to get
     that.

[00:03:48:28]
LMP: Okay. I think Jim is holding it now and - it -
     Okay, it should be in about f:22, infinity, and
     I think the 50-millimeter. And Jim says he thinks
     he hit Baja in the picture now.

[00:03:48:50]
CC:  Okay. I think we can stand to go to f:44 on that.
     The clouds are pretty bright.

     so we are back inside.

     arm?

     arm.

[00:03:54:50]
CMP: Hey, Joe, when we went back up and rechecked the
     tunnel there, we found two latches that weren't
     cocked and we reset them.

CMP: Joe, I've got a beautiful view of the Earth out
     window 1.

[00:03:57:03]
CC:  Roger, Jack.

[00:03:57:04]
LMP: By the way, the windows came through in real good
     shape. Window 5 looks real clean, so I am kind
     of hopeful that Hycon stuff will be pretty good.

[00:03:57:14]
CC:  Good deal.

[00:03:57:22]
LMP: I meant window 3, Joe.

[00:03:57:58]
CC:  Okay, 13; Houston. You're GO for [glossary:LM] SEP whenever
     you're ready.

[00:03:58:06]
CDR: Roger.

[00:03:58:18]
CC:  Okay, 13; Houston. Correction on that. You're
     GO for [glossary:LM] SEP at the nominal time and - or later.
     We don't want it early.

[00:03:58:27]
CDR: Okay, Joe. We'll do it at [time:00:04:01:00|04:01:00].

[00:03:58:29]
CC:  Roger.

[00:04:00:54]
CMP: Okay. We're about ready to pull the [glossary:LM] out, Joe.

[00:04:00:59]

CMP: Okay. Looks like we're clear, Joe.

[00:04:01:19]

     TV about 10 seconds after you call it.

[00:04:02:45]

[00:04:02:53]
CC:  Okay. We'll be waiting for you to tell us that
     you feel you're safely clear of the booster, and
     give us the GO to command the booster in its yaw
     maneuver.

[00:04:04:39]
CC:  13, Houston. Did you copy my last about giving
     us a GO for the yaw?

[00:04:04:46]
LMP: Yes, we're maneuvering, Joe, and we hadn't picked
     her back up again yet.

[00:04:04:55]
CC:  Okay. Do you want to wait till you acquire it
     before we yaw it?

[00:04:05:03]
CDR: How much time do you have, Houston? Can you
     wait, or do you want to do it right now?

[00:04:05:09]
CC:  We can wait if you want us to, Jim.

[00:04:05:11]
CDR: Why don't you wait just a little bit.

[00:04:05:13]
CC:  Okay.

[00:04:06:02]
CMP: Joe, did they ever get an idea of what that -
     the TD and E fuel was?

[00:04:06:09]
CC:  Jack, they're not willing to pin it down to a
     specific number right now because they say the
     tanks will warm up later on and the apparent
     consumption will go down. But it was nominal.

[00:04:06:20]
CMP: Okay.

[00:04:08:26]
CMP: Okay, Houston. We have the [glossary:S-IVB] in sight. You
     are GO to maneuver the [glossary:S-IVB].

[00:04:08:31]
CC:  Houston, Roger that.

[00:04:09:04]
CMP: Try to give you a - Houston, we're going to try
     to give you a shot of the [glossary:S-IVB] with the TV out
     window number 3.

[00:04:09:11]
_page : 33
_tape : Tape 3/9
CC:  Okay. Real good, Jack. Our S-band signal
     strength has been fluctuating. Does it seem
     to be going all right up there in the AUTO TRACK
     mode?

[00:04:09:24]
LMP: Yes. Right now; yes, it's dropped off to about
     the 70-percent point, Joe, and it was before up
     about 85.

[00:04:09:34]
CC:  Okay.

[00:04:09:54]
CDR: And, Houston, do you have a TV picture?

[00:04:09:57]
CC:  Not at the moment, Jim. We had a garbled one
     there for a few seconds, and we don't have one at
     this moment.

[00:04:10:05]
CDR: Okay. I can see the [glossary:S-IVB] now out the hatch
     window and it's - -

[00:04:10:11]
CC:  Okay, Jim. Suddenly we have a very good picture.

[00:04:10:13]
CDR: Okay.

[00:04:10:50]
CDR: And, Houston, I can see the gold shroud around
     the [glossary:IU], and it looks that it's all intact.

[00:04:10:56]
CC:  Roger, Jim. We copy that. Incidentally, the
     [glossary:APS] evasive maneuver will be about 4 minutes late.
     It'll be at about 04 plus 18.

[00:04:11:09]
CDR: Roger.

[00:04:11:37]
CC:  13, Houston. Wonder if you could zoom in on that
     [glossary:S-IVB] for us a little bit?

[00:04:11:42]
CDR: Okay.

[00:04:12:19]
CC:  Yes, yes. More like that. That's nice. It's
     off our screen to the right, now.

[00:04:13:08]
CC:  Oh, that's very nice, very nice.

[00:04:13:55]
CMP: Okay, Joe. Is [glossary:EECOM] monitoring the O<sub>2</sub> FLOW HIGH
     light again? We haven't yet started the venting
     yet.

[00:04:14:04]
CC:  Okay. Stand by. I'll check.

CMP: Go ahead.

[00:04:14:39]
CC:  Jack, your cabin REGs are still making up, but
     you're GO to open the waste management vent again
     at this time, and we'll delta the time to close
     it by the appropriate amount for you.

[00:04:14:52]
CMP: Okay. Real fine. Well, we'll wait till the
     [glossary:S-IVB] does its maneuver here.

[00:04:14:58]
CC:  Okay.

[00:04:16:53]
LMP: Okay, Joe. We just had a momentary dropoff in
     signal strength again there.

[00:04:16:59]
CC:  Roger, Fred. We had an [glossary:LOS] for a minute and we
     lost our TV picture. It looks like - yes, we
     Just got it back. It looks great again.

[00:04:17:15]
CC:  13, Houston. You might stop the f-stop down one
     more notch, if you got any left.

[00:04:17:41]
CC:  And, 13, Houston. We'll be commanding the evasive
     maneuver in about 17 seconds.

[00:04:18:41]
CMP: Okay, Joe. We can see it start to move. However,
     it doesn't seem to be a lot of debris or vapor
     coming out of it.

[00:04:18:48]
CC:  Roger that, Jack. Booster says that's great. He
     says the booster's doing its thing normally. Concur. We don't see much on the television at all.

[00:04:19:16]
CC:  And, Apollo 13, Houston. We'd like to change the
     S-band and antenna configuration. Like you to
     go OMNI Delta. Like you to go MANUAL mode on the
     high gain with pitch of minus 60 and yaw of 90.
     Over.

[00:04:19:37]
LMP: Okay. You want us to OMNI Delta and MANUAL on the
     high gain to minus 60 and plus 90. Is that
     correct?

[00:04:19:44]
CC:  That's affirmative.

[00:04:20:06]
CMP: Okay, Houston. How much longer would you like the
     television?

[00:04:20:10]
CC:  Stand by on that. We'll get a word.

[00:04:20:21]
_page : 35
_tape : Tape 3/11
CC:  Okay, 13; this is Houston. You can turn the TV
     off anytime you're ready. We've enjoyed the
     show.

[00:04:20:40]
CC:  13, Houston. Before you secure the TV, we'd like
     to know whether that was in maximum zoom, just
     for information.

[00:04:20:48]
LMP: That's affirm. Jim had it in MAX zoom.

[00:04:20:51]
CC:  Okay. Good deal. That was a real good picture.

[00:04:21:24]
CC:  And, 13, Houston. The [glossary:APS] evasive maneuver appeared to be nominal. The LOX dump time is now
     4 plus 39 plus 20, about 3 minutes late.

[00:04:21:37]

CC:  Apollo 13, Houston.

[00:04:39:04]
LMP: Go ahead, Joe.

[00:04:39:07]
CC:  Roger. They are having trouble verifying that
     the high gain is doing its thing. Like to verify
     that the pitch is minus 10, the Y is plus 350,
     you're in WIDE BEAM WIDTH and AUTO.

[00:04:39:29]
LMP: Okay. Minus 10 pitch, plus 350 yaw, and WIDE
     BEAM WIDTH and going into AUTO. You want HIGH
     GAIN, John?

[00:04:39:41]
CC:  That's affirm.

[00:04:50:49]
LMP: Is the [glossary:S-IVB] doing something different now?

[00:04:50:56]
CC:  Well, I don't know. It should be - let's see,
     it should have started the LOX dump at least
     quite a while ago. I guess that's complete.
     Why do you ask, Fred?

[00:04:51:10]
LMP: I'm looking out window 5 at what I think is the
     [glossary:S-IVB], and I'm seeing what looks to be double
     plumes, going in two very narrow bands maybe
     about 3 degrees that are streaming out from it.
     And then there is a less dense band that covers
     maybe a 40-degree swath through the sky that
     continues out, also, in two directions.

[00:04:51:45]
CMP: Hey, Joe, what it looks like, kind of, is if you
     pull up behind a guy that's pulling a contrail,
     and you get in his contrail, like he's going away
     from you - there's a long contrail -

[00:04:51:55]
CC:  Okay; stand by. Let me see what Frank's got
     to say about that.

[00:04:51:59]
LMP: Except we're between - Looks like we're between
     two contrails, one guy above and one below.

[00:04:52:07]
CC:  Roger.

[00:04:52:14]
LMP: It's a very pretty sight.

[00:04:52:33]
CC:  Okay, 13; Houston. The booster says that the
     propulsive dump is concluded; he now has the
     nonpropulsive vents open and what you see is a
     normal phenomenon and it should go on for
     another 5 minutes or so.

[00:04:52:52]
LMP: Okay.

[00:04:52:54]
CC:  And, while I've got you, 13, at your convenience,
     we'd like to have the results of the [glossary:EMS] bias
     tests that you did pre-[glossary:TLI] and pre-SEP.

CMP: Okay, Joe. The [glossary:TLI] - the DELTA-V no bias test
     prior to [glossary:TLI], we had a 0.8, and post-[glossary:TLI], it
     was 1.0.

[00:04:54:24]
CC:  Okay, Jack. Copy that. Thank you very much.
     Incidentally, as your tracking gets better and
     better, the size of [glossary:MCC]-2 is getting lower and

[00:08:02:39]
CC:  Fred, recommend that, when your window comes
     around facing the Earth again, that you catch
     another one of those pictures, and at the same
     time, you should probably start [glossary:PTC] again. We
     might have sent a confusing bit of info up to
     you. The "disable two quads" only applies to an
     early step in the procedure. We didn't mean that
     for the latter part of the procedure where we
     have the statement "enable all jets." Over.

[00:08:03:15]
LMP: Okay.

[00:08:07:33]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 13.

[00:08:07:43]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston. Go ahead.

[00:08:07:46]
CMP: Vance, Fred said that you had some more information about [glossary:PTC] and a different way of establishing
     it or something, huh?

[00:08:07:55]
CC:  Roger. Referring to the procedure on G/8-2, if
     you have that open, I'll tell you what we had to
     give you.

[00:08:08:11]
CMP: Okay. Stand by and I'll get it out.

[00:08:08:13]
CC:  Okay.

[00:08:08:35]
_page : 44
_tape : Tape 6/2
CMP: Okay. Go ahead, Van.

[00:08:08:38]
CC:  Okay. On checklist G/8-2 under step 5, there's
     a statement, "disable all jets on two adjacent
     quads," and that's what we were referring to when
     we called up saying "disable quads A and B." So
     that's all fine; however, going down now to step 7
     where it says "enable all jets," we hoped that
     you didn't think we meant leave A and B disabled
     there. In that case, it's as written. All jets
     should be enabled. Over.

[00:08:09:20]
CMP: Okay. Our checklist has "all jets" scratched out,
     and it says "enable couples on all axes." So what
     we'll do is - we'll reestablish this thing and
     come down to that step 7, and we'll enable all
     jets. That means enable quads A and B. Is that
     right?

[00:08:09:42]
CC:  That's affirm. You'll have A, B, C, and D enabled for step 7.

[00:08:09:47]
CMP: Okay, real fine. I'll start on it now.

[00:08:09:51]
CC:  Okay. Understand you're going to reestablish it.

[00:08:10:46]
LMP: And Vance, on that picture, I was all set to shoot
     it just a little before you called, and the Earth
     hasn't showed up in the window yet. I don't know
     if we got too far off the bellyband or what.

[00:08:11:02]

     0.3 degrees per second. Over.

[00:08:20:27]

[00:08:20:38]

     time, which I believe is plus.

[00:08:20:47]

[00:08:25:06]

     of give an idea of when you think they're stable
     enough to start [glossary:PTC].

     20 pounds above the curve right now. Looking at
     the TD&E, you expended 65 pounds or - Stand by -
     55 pounds, correction on that.

[00:08:27:27]
CMP: How much?

[00:08:27:28]
CC:  And 14 pounds on [glossary:P23]s. You used a little more
     out of quad A than out of the others.

[00:09:24:08]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[00:09:24:11]
CC:  Jim, Houston here. Two items: first of all,
     your [glossary:PTC] is looking very good and it should
     carry you through the night; second point, have
     a procedure to give you, if you're ready to
     copy. We'd like to set three bits in the computer,
     and I'll explain why.

[00:09:24:43]
LMP: Go ahead, Vance, we're ready to copy.

[00:09:24:46]
CC:  Okay. The procedure is as follows: [glossary:VERB 25],
     [glossary:NOUN 07], ENTER; 1331, ENTER; 7, ENTER; and ENTER.
     Explanation as follows. During the [glossary:P23]s, there
     was one time when [glossary:VERB 37] was entered into the
     computer at about 16 seconds after the OPTICS
     ZERO switch was flicked to ZERO. This is a very
     uncommon anomaly in that, if you do this during -
     0.4-second interval at around 16 seconds after
     you zero the optics, some OPT-mode bits are
     reset; and this would mean that, if you had a
     OCDU fail, it wouldn't be indicated; so all this
     procedure is doing is setting these three bits
     back again where they should be.

[00:09:26:01]
LMP: Okay, Vance, and I guess I'll try to be slower
     on that [glossary:VERB 37].

[00:09:26:07]
CC:  Yes. Actually slower or faster, either one, I
     guess. Well, yes, slower. It's a very unusual
     thing to have that happen.

[00:09:26:19]

     convinced it's even the Earth. All we see is
     water and clouds.

[00:11:24:02]
CC:  13, Houston. You're very weak. Please repeat.

[00:11:24:07]
CDR: Vance, to my calculations, we have taken about
     10 Earth window photography pictures. I see
     nothing coming up here except to close the waste
     stowage vent here in a little while. I was
     thinking about getting squared away to bed down
     for the evening pretty soon.

[00:11:24:35]
CC:  Okay. That sounds good, Jim. FAO here would like
     to request just one more picture before you bed
     down, if you don't mind.

[00:11:24:47]
CDR: Okay. We'll come through with one more picture.

[00:11:24:50]
CC:  Okay.

[00:11:30:33]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston.

[00:11:30:38]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[00:11:30:40]
CC:  A couple of items, Jim. The first is, the time
     for closing the waste stowage vent is [time:00:12:24:00|12:24]. If
     you turn in before that time, why it's okay as far
     as we're concerned down here to close it before
     that time just before you go to bed. The second
     point, we have some results on the [glossary:P23]s, and, if
     Jack's interested, we could give him the corrected
     altitudes we're getting, and so forth.

[00:11:31:18]
CMP: Yes. I sure am, Vance.

[00:11:31:26]
CC:  Okay. This is preliminary results, but it will
     give you some indication. Corrected altitude is
     turning out to be 17 plus or minus 4 kilometers,
     and the fact that it's plus or minus 4 kilometers
     indicates that you're being very consistent in
     judging the altitude. The effective altitude is
     turning out to be 10 plus or minus 12 kilometers.
     Comments are that, as I said before, you're being
     consistent on the horizon selection. The substellar point error is averaging 15 arc-minutes
     and if you could hold the rates to a minimum, you
     might shoot for 5 arc-minutes. That's the only
     comment there. Over.

[00:11:32:31]

[00:11:32:35]

[00:11:37:46]

     little south of the flight plan value. We have
     it at a [glossary:GET] of about 77 plus 51 which is just
     before [glossary:AOS], and the [glossary:LOI] pads are a little bit
     late, and as I say, it's still pretty soft, and
     we'll be updating you with firm numbers.

[00:23:19:57]
CDR: That's fine, Joe. Just as long as it doesn't
     hit Cone Crater.

[00:23:20:02]
CC:  Okay. And I'll have a consumables update for
     you in a little while, and I have a small flight
     plan update for you sometime a little later on
     when you're ready to copy. There's no big deals
     in it.

[00:23:20:19]
CDR: Roger.

[00:23:20:23]
CC:  And, 13, Houston. We'd like to verify that you
     cycled the O<sub>2</sub> cryo fans. We saw the H<sub>2</sub>, but we
     didn't see the O<sub>2</sub> get stirred up.

[00:23:20:35]
CMP: Yes, Joe. We did, and it kind of looked like we
     might have had a little stratification because
     right after we put them on, we had a CRYO PRESS
     light.

[00:23:20:45]
_extra : END OF TAPE
_page : 64
_tape : Tape 15/3
CC:  Okay. [glossary:EECOM] told me that might happen, and
     he was right.

[00:23:21:54]
_page : 65
_tape : Tape 16/1
CMP: Okay, Joe. We're ready to copy a flight plan
     update and your consumables.

[00:23:22:00]
CC:  Okay, Jack. The flight plan update has a couple
     of items in it, and the first one we'd like to do
     is to update the T<sub>ephem</sub> values in the G&C checklist on page G/9-2. These are fairly small
     changes, but in case you need them, we'd like you
     to have the exact numbers. Over.

[00:23:22:25]
CMP: Okay. Just a minute. I'll get it out.

[00:23:22:56]
CMP: Joe, was that the G&C checklist, page 9-2?

[00:23:23:00]
CC:  That's affirmative. G&C, page G/9-2.

[00:23:23:08]
CMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[00:23:23:09]
CC:  Okay. On that page in line 04, column B, change
     the number from 03366 to 05253. Over.

[00:23:23:30]
CMP: - - 53.

[00:23:23:31]
CC:  Okay. And in line 05, column B, change from
     11000 to 33661. Over.

[00:23:23:47]
CMP: 33661.

[00:23:23:50]
CC:  Okay. That's right. The only other thing I've
     got for you, Jack, is three additional questions
     for the booster systems debriefing, which is to
     take place at about 25 hours, and we thought we'd
     pass these questions up to you early so you can
     consider them. Over.

[00:23:24:12]
CDR: Okay. We're ready to copy.

[00:23:24:15]
CC:  Okay. The first extra is, and let me get the
     original question because this question says,
     "More specifically on item 2," and item 2 says,
     "Were there any significant changes in the noise
     vibration level during the single stage of
     powered flight?" Specifically, describe your
     observations during the early S-II center engine
     out-off, and approximately 90 seconds prior to
     [glossary:TLI] cut-off, you reported a high vibration in
     the [glossary:S-IVB]. We'd like you to describe the buildup
     of this vibration and its behavior through cut-off. Over.

[00:23:25:02]
_page : 66
_tape : Tape 16/2
CDR: Okay. Essentially, what you'd like us to talk
     about is vibration sequence during the early
     S-II cut-off of the center engine and also
     describe the vibrations that we encountered
     during the [glossary:S-IVB] [glossary:TLI] burn. Is that correct?

[00:23:25:17]
CC:  That's it. Okay. The second extra question is
     for you, Jim, and it says, "Comparing this flight
     with your ride on Apollo 8, were there any significant differences in the powered flight
     environment?"

[00:23:25:35]
CDR: Okay. We'll describe a comparison with 8 and 13
     as far as powered flight goes.

[00:23:25:41]
CC:  Roger. And the last additional question is what
     did the [glossary:ORDEAL] ball look like during [glossary:TLI]? As
     you know, we passed you an update to that setting,
     and we'd like to know whether it was riding right
     on zero or what during the burn. Over.

[00:23:26:00]
CDR: Okay. Will do. We'll describe the [glossary:ORDEAL] ball.

[00:23:26:03]
CC:  Okay. That's it, and that's the whole flight
     plan update. I have a consumables update now if
     you want to listen to that.

[00:23:26:12]
CMP: Okay, Joe. We're ready to copy.

[00:23:26:14]
CC:  Okay. At 23 hours the total [glossary:RCS] is 1121, quad A
     is 274, quad Bravo is 286, quad Charlie is 274,
     quad Delta is 287, and the cryos are as follows:
     H<sub>2</sub> tank 1, 83 percent; H<sub>2</sub> tank 2, 86 percent;
     O<sub>2</sub> tank 1, 87 percent; O<sub>2</sub> tank 2, 87 percent.
     Over.

[00:23:27:07]
CMP: Okay, Joe. We got all those, and how do we compare them with where we should be in the time
     line?

[00:23:27:15]
CC:  As I understand it, Jack, you're running slightly
     ahead of nominal in both those areas.

[00:23:27:24]
CMP: Okay; real fine.

[00:23:27:25]
CC:  No problem.

[00:23:28:07]
CC:  And, 13, Houston. That's all the business I got
     right now. I have a little news and plan of the
     day for you, if you feel like listening to that a
     little later on.

[00:23:28:30]
_page : 67
_tape : Tape 16/3
CDR: Just hold off a little bit there, Joe if you
     don't mind. ...

[00:23:28:36]
CC:  Stand by one, Jim. You're coming in garbled again.

[00:23:29:58]
CMP: Houston, 13.

[00:23:30:00]
CC:  Okay, 13; Houston. Loud and clear again. Go
     ahead.

[00:23:30:05]
CMP: Okay. Joe. On the news, Jim would like to hold
     off a little bit on that, and I want to make a
     request to FAO, if he will at sometime during the
     day, when we get a flight plan update with those
     activities we agreed to make optional during
     lunar orbit and the few activities we were going
     to delete, I think that I forgot and left that
     card back during the press of suiting, I left it
     in the suit room.

[00:23:30:33]
CC:  Okay. Wilco.

[00:23:30:35]
CC:  Okay, Jack. I understand FAO's working on that
     and we'll have something for you later on.

[00:23:30:42]
CMP: Okay. We're not in any hurry.

[00:23:30:45]
CC:  Roger.

[00:23:47:00]
CMP: Okay, Houston; 13.

[00:23:47:11]
CC:  Okay. Jack. We copy the angles. You can go
     ahead and torque them.

[00:23:47:24]
CMP: Okay. Joe. The time of torquing will be 23 hours
     47 minutes 30 seconds.

[00:23:47:30]
CC:  We copy.

[00:23:54:45]
CDR: Houston, 13.

[00:23:54:48]
CC:  13, Houston. Go ahead.

[00:23:54:51]
CDR: For information, Joe, we're all configured back
     again now to our regular seating positions, if
     you're monitoring us.

[00:23:54:59]
CC:  Okay. Thank you, Jim.

[01:00:16:02]
CDR: Hello there, Houston; 13.

[01:00:16:08]
_page : 68
_tape : Tape 16/4
CC:  13, Houston. Go ahead.

[01:00:16:12]
CDR: Gosh, we had forgotten, but we'd like to hear
     what the news is.

[01:00:16:15]
CC:  Okay. There's not a whole lot to it. Well, let's
     see, we'll start with the - Let's start with
     sports, what the heck. The Astros survived 8 to 7,
     the Braves got five or six runs in the - five runs
     in the ninth inning, but they just made it; and in
     the other important game of the day, the Cubs were
     rained out. I have all the rest of the scores,
     you can tell me if you want any of them. They
     had earthquakes in Manila and other areas of the
     island of Luzon. There were three tremors and
     they kept the buildings shaking for about a half
     an hour or so, and it was about a 5 on the Richter
     scale. Okay, let's see. The Beatles have announced they will no longer perform as a group.
     The quartet is reported to have made in excess of
     a half billion dollars during their short musical
     career. However, rumors that they will use this
     money to start their own space program are false.

[01:00:17:24]
CDR: Maybe we could borrow some.

[01:00:17:26]
CC:  (Laughter) Okay. Okay; West German Chancellor
     Willy Brandt, who witnessed your launch from the
     Cape yesterday, and President Nixon will complete
     their round of talks today. Brandt reportedly
     came to the U.S. to seek assurance from the
     President to go ahead with talks with the eastern
     European nations, especially East Germany, Poland,
     and Russia. Many air traffic controllers are
     still out, but reports indicate that they are
     slowly returning to work, and you'll be happy to
     know the controllers here in the MOCR are still
     on the job.

[01:00:18:04]
CDR: ...

[01:00:18:05]
CC:  Go ahead.

[01:00:18:09]
CDR: I said thank goodness for that.

[01:00:18:10]
CC:  Okay. Some truck lines are being struck in the
     Midwest, and the school teachers have walked off
     the job in Minneapolis. Today's favorite pasttime
     across the - Uh oh; have you guys completed your
     income tax?

[01:00:18:28]
_page : 69
_tape : Tape 16/5
CDR: How do I apply for an extension?

[01:00:18:31]
CC:  (Laughter)

[01:00:18:32]
CMP: Yes, Joe. I got to - hey, listen - It ain't too
     funny; things kind of happened real fast down
     there, and I do need an extension.

[01:00:18:43]
CC:  (Laughter)

[01:00:18:44]
CMP: I didn't get mine filed. And this is serious;
     would you - -

[01:00:18:47]
CC:  You're breaking up the room down here.

[01:00:18:49]
CMP: - - because I may be spending time in a - -

[01:00:18:51]
CC:  We'll see - -

[01:00:18:52]
CMP: I may be spending time in a - I may be spending
     time in another quarantine besides the one that
     they are planning for me.

[01:00:18:59]
CC:  We'll see what we can do, Jack. We'll get with
     Recovery and see if we can get the agent out there
     in the Pacific when you come back. By golly, let's
     see. In professional basketball, the Nicks beat
     the Milwaukee Bucks 110 to 102, and Billy Casper
     is leading the Masters after 54 holes with a 208,
     and spring football practice is in full swing.
     And that's about all the news we got; the updated
     plan of the day for you guys, the uniform will be
     service dress inflight coverall garments with
     swords and medals, and tonight's movie shown in
     the lower equipment bay will be John Wayne, Lou
     Costello, and Shirley Temple in the "The Flight
     of Apollo 13." Over.

[01:00:19:50]
CDR: Outstanding.

[01:00:20:06]
CDR: Houston, this is 13. Is it true that Jack's income tax return was going to be used to buy the
     ascent fuel for the [glossary:LM]?

[01:00:20:18]
CC:  Well, considering that he's a bachelor and hasn't
     got that deduction to take, yes.

[01:00:20:29]
CMP: Hey, Joe. I'm glad you brought that up, because
     I was really serious about that.

[01:00:20:36]
CC:  Okay, Jack. We'll - We'll take care of it. Tom
     Stafford says he'll get an extension for you.

[01:00:20:43]
_page : 70
_tape : Tape 16/6
CMP: Okay.

[01:00:20:50]
CC:  And Jim McDivitt says, "yes, now that you mention
     it, he forgot to fill the ascent stage."

[01:00:21:00]
CDR: (Laughter) Suspicions confirmed.

[01:00:21:04]
CC:  Should give you very good performance on descent.

[01:00:21:11]
LMP: We should have a lot more hover time, huh?

[01:00:21:13]
CC:  That's right.

[01:00:21:23]
CC:  Okay, crew. About the only other thing I've got
     for you right now is an update to your [glossary:P37] pad
     for lift-off plus 35. This is a change to the
     pad we gave you yesterday. The reason for the
     update is for weather avoidance in the mid-Pacific
     landing area at 70 hours, which is the return time
     for this pad, and in case the question arises in
     your mind, we don't expect any problem there for
     the end of the mission. The weather area is
     20 degrees south of your end-of-mission landing
     point, and it appears to be moving to the south.

[01:00:22:01]
CDR: Okay, Joe. I'm ready to copy the pad.

[01:00:22:03]
CC:  Okay. [glossary:GET] of ignition is 035:00, DELTA-V<sub>T</sub> 7883,
     Longitude minus 155, and the [glossary:GET] 400K 069:54. Over.

[01:00:22:28]
CDR: [glossary:GETI] is 035:00, 7883, minus 155, 069:54.

[01:00:22:39]
CC:  Okay.

[01:00:23:17]
CDR: And, Houston, Jack's going to try donning his suit
     now for practice, himself, and when he gets it out,
     we'll give you a dosimeter reading.

[01:00:23:26]
CC:  Okay. Real good.

[01:00:41:49]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 13.

[01:00:41:51]
CC:  13, Houston. Go.

[01:00:41:55]
CDR: Okay. We've retrieved Jack's dosimeter, and it's
     reading 02022.

[01:00:42:07]
CC:  Okay. We copy 02022 on the dosimeter, Jim.

[01:00:42:14]
CDR: That's affirm.

[01:00:42:31]
_page : 71
_tape : Tape 10/7
CC:  13, Houston. At your convenience, we'd like the
     [glossary:LM]/[glossary:CM] DELTA-P reading.

[01:00:42:37]
CDR: That reading is 0.65 psi.

[01:00:42:42]
_extra : END OF TAPE
CC:  Copy 0.65. Thank you.

[01:01:10:56]
_page : 72
_tape : Tape 17/1
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston.

[01:01:10:58]
CDR: Houston, Apol ... Roger. We're thinking together.
     And we're here waiting for your call.

[01:01:11:07]
CC:  Okay, you were a little broken up there, Jim, but
     I think it's getting better. We are ready for
     the launch-vehicle-systems debriefing whenever
     you are.

[01:01:11:31]
CDR: Okay, Houston; Apollo 13. You were cut out again;
     say again, please.

[01:01:11:35]
CC:  Roger, Jim. We are ready for the launch-vehicle-systems debriefing whenever you are. Over.

[01:01:11:43]
CDR: Okay. Stand by 1.

[01:01:12:00]
CDR: Okay, Houston; 13. In answer to Question 1, the
     changes in noise level occurred mainly between
     the first stage and the other stages - the other
     stages were about the same in noise level, very
     quiet, with the first stage, of course, making
     quite a bit of noise in the beginning but - which
     built up during the high Q, and then ... went
     quiet just after high Q.

[01:01:12:31]
CC:  Okay, copy that, Jim.

[01:01:12:37]
CDR: I might mention that the noise level during the
     first stage was not sufficient to be uncomfortable
     at all.

[01:01:12:46]
CC:  Roger. And I assume COMM was okay.

[01:01:12:50]
CDR: That's affirm. COMM was very good all during -
     throughout the entire flight. Much better than
     I expected.

[01:01:12:57]
CC:  Okay.

[01:01:13:04]
CDR: Now, in answer to Question 2, there was, of course,
     a vibration transient in the second stage that -
     due to the number 5 engine going out - which
     occurred shortly before the engine went out, and
     slightly after that then the S-II stage was very
     smooth.

[01:01:13:33]
_page : 73
_tape : Tape 17/2
CC:  Okay, Jim. I guess the significant point there
     is that you didn't notice the vibration before
     you saw the engine light.

[01:01:13:39]
CDR: That's right. We - we noticed the vibration but
     it wasn't such that we thought something catastrophic was going to happen; it just started
     vibration and then the EN light came on, and then
     the vibration went away and the stage itself was
     smooth.

[01:01:13:59]
CC:  Okay, copy that.

[01:01:14:03]
CMP: Yes, and that - it was all pretty - pretty short in
     span - just a second or so before and like a second
     afterwards, Joe.

[01:01:14:14]
CC:  Oh. Roger.

[01:01:14:18]
CDR: And on the [glossary:S-IVB], the vibration of the vehicle itself wasn't what ... second ... powered flight - a
     very-high-frequency vibration.

[01:01:14:33]
CC:  That was - was that during - just during [glossary:TLI], or
     did you notice that at insertion?

[01:01:14:45]
CDR: Well, it was a high-frequency viola - vibration
     but more noticeable during the [glossary:TLI] burn than it
     was during the ... flight.

[01:01:14:59]
CC:  Okay, I - understand.

[01:01:15:13]
CMP: I guess the [glossary:S-IVB] vibration during [glossary:TLI] was there
     all the time although it seemed to - to grow to
     us as the burn progressed, although that may have
     been just due to the boost weight decrease.

[01:01:15:30]
CC:  Okay, you called this about 3-1/2 minutes, but I
     guess the thing was slowly building up throughout
     the whole burn. Right?

[01:01:15:37]
CMP: That's right.

[01:01:15:40]
CC:  Okay, was it uncomfortable or did it cause your
     vision to degrade or anything like that?

[01:01:15:46]
CDR: No, it - it was not uncomfortable at all but I was
     recalling the ride on 8, and the [glossary:S-IVB] was more -
     much more smooth than even it was on 13.

[01:01:15:59]
_page : 74
_tape : Tape 17/3
CC:  Copy that.

[01:01:16:24]
CDR: Okay, now, in answer to number 3, we did not experience any unexpected transients except that
     all of us noticed the PU shift. We thought it
     was more pronounced than we had expected it to be.

[01:01:16:39]
CC:  Okay. Understand.

[01:01:16:42]
CMP: Joe, on that. I guess most of every time that PU
     shift occurred we all - almost all of us glanced
     at the engine light. We could feel definite
     acceleration change.

[01:01:16:53]
CC:  Roger. Understand, Jack.

[01:01:16:58]
CDR: And, during the high-Q portion of the flight, the
     Alfa meter, to my knowledge, nearly went above
     25 percent.

[01:01:17:06]
CC:  Okay.

[01:01:17:14]
CDR: In answer to number 4, we got a pretty good look
     at the thermal shroud and the [glossary:IU] after taking the
     [glossary:LM] away, and from our viewpoint, the shroud was
     completely intact. I saw no loose particles or
     parts of it floating at all.

[01:01:17:30]
CC:  Okay, Jim. Understand.

[01:01:17:40]
CDR: And, I guess we answered number 5. I don't think
     at any time did we have any communication problem
     during powered flight.

[01:01:17:45]
CC:  Roger.

[01:01:17:59]
CDR: In answer to number 6, the answer is essentially
     no. We saw no venting or suspected leak on the
     [glossary:LM] or the [glossary:CSM] ...

[01:01:18:14]
CC:  Okay, Jim. I guess you described to us the non-propulsive venting on the [glossary:S-IVB] after the [glossary:APS]
     maneuver and we copied that at the time.

[01:01:18:30]
CDR: Okay. Fred saw the [glossary:S-IVB] venting.

[01:01:18:33]
LMP: Yes, we had already talked about that, Joe. And
     that was also visible when it - of course, when
     it did its evasive maneuver when we were looking
     at it right close up.

[01:01:18:44]
_page : 75
_tape : Tape 17/4
CC:  Roger.

[01:01:19:12]
CDR: Okay, Joe. The last time we saw the [glossary:S-IVB] positively was when Fred saw it venting at about - at
     about 5 hours. We think we might have picked it
     up later on. We saw a particle or something out
     there that was tumbling which might have been the
     booster or one of the [glossary:SLA] panels.

[01:01:19:34]
CC:  And when was that, Jim?

[01:01:19:41]
CDR: We're - we're debating. It was somewhere between -
     say 7:30 and 9 hours.

[01:01:19:47]
CC:  Okay.

[01:01:19:50]
LMP: But, Joe, assuming the [glossary:S-IVB] is still stable.
     The object I was looking at was definitely
     tumbling.

[01:01:20:01]
CC:  Okay, Fred. As I recall, it was stable then,
     although it's tumbling now.

[01:01:20:08]
LMP: Okay. It probably was the [glossary:SLA] panel I picked up.

[01:01:20:14]
CC:  Right. Incidentally, I guess the guys in building 6 - -

[01:01:20:17]
CDR: Oh and I think we -

[01:01:20:18]
CC:  Go ahead, Jim.

[01:01:20:19]
CDR: I - I think we answer to number 9. We - at
     around [time:00:00:05:32|5:32], I think, was when we think the
     number 5 light came on in the S-II, and a
     definite vibration which was more than just a
     high-frequency vibration we got with the normal
     S-IV burn, and then the light came on. I called
     ECO thinking from the training that it was 7:42
     and looked up at the time and realized it was
     early. And then, soon after the light came on,
     the vibration stopped and the engine or the
     booster smoothed down. It was very smooth from
     there on.

[01:01:20:59]
CC:  Okay. This may be a stupid question, but do you
     have any idea what the frequency of it was?

[01:01:21:08]
CDR: Only to say that it was much higher - I couldn't
     really guess now. It was rather a rapid longitudinal vibration.

[01:01:21:23]
_page : 76
_tape : Tape 17/5
CC:  Okay, Jim. Stand by now for a minute, we're
     going to switch OMNI.

[01:01:22:48]
CDR: Houston, 13, ...

[01:01:22:51]
CC:  13, Houston. I read you. We still have quite
     a bit of noise on the loop.

[01:01:22:59]
CDR: I'll stand by. Roger.

[01:01:23:04]
CC:  Okay, Jim. It should be pretty good now. We
     copied you answering question number 9.

[01:01:23:16]
CDR: Do you want any more comments on the [glossary:S-IVB]
     vibrations?

[01:01:23:20]
CC:  I don't think so. When you get all done, I'll -
     I'll make a quick check to see if the booster
     people have any - any additional questions. You
     skipped number 8, Jim; could you go back to that
     for a second?

[01:01:23:34]
CDR: Okay, stand by.

[01:01:23:54]
CDR: Our only comment there, Joe, was that the burn on
     [glossary:TLI], to our knowledge, was about 3-3/4 second
     longer than had been predicted and that was the
     only thing that we really noticed; otherwise,
     looked like PI [?] was nominal at cut-off.

[01:01:24:11]
CC:  Okay, understand.

[01:01:24:23]
CDR: Okay, on comparing the flight of 13 to Apollo 8,
     lift-off was about the same amount of vibration
     as I noticed on 8, but at the beginning of the
     flight, there was less of the sideways motion
     than we experienced on Apollo 8. The S-IC separation felt more violent on 13 than it did on 8,
     maybe that's because I was in a different seat, I
     don't know. But there was about three sharp
     transients of the cut-off and a couple of big
     bangs where we were thrown backwards longitudinally
     on our straps before the S-II went off. And the
     S-II was, of course, just as smooth on 13 as 8
     except for the number 5 engine. And we did not
     experience the vibration that we experienced on
     8 towards the end of the S-II burn. And the
     [glossary:S-IVB] was - had more vibration than we had on 8.

[01:01:25:31]
CC:  Okay, Jim, got all that.

[01:01:25:39]
_page : 77
_tape : Tape 17/6
CDR: The up - the update on the [glossary:ORDEAL] ball was a
     good one. At the burn, we were about - just
     about 8 degrees. We had to pitch down. The yaw
     was right on all the way through the entire burn,
     and just towards the end of the burn, the ball
     started going black in pitch a little bit.

[01:01:26:03]
CC:  Okay, sounds good, we'll give Mike Wash a gold
     star on that one. Okay, Jim, stand by 1 while
     I see if we have any extra questions.

[01:01:26:44]
CC:  Jim, while we're waiting to see if they have any
     more questions, I'd like to read you the booster
     people's preliminary analysis on the - the S-II
     cut-off. Over.

[01:01:26:58]
CDR: That would be very interesting. Go ahead.

[01:01:27:00]
CC:  Okay, preliminary analysis of the data indicates
     that the center S-II engine vibrated at a somewhat higher amplitude than we've seen on previous
     flights, and it started at about 160 seconds into
     the S-II burn. As a result of these vibrations,
     the engine chamber pressure decreased to the level
     where the two low-level thrust sensors, the thrust-okay sensors, initiated center engine cut-off.
     Early evaluation of data indicates that no damage
     occurred to the engine, and the cause of the increased vibration amplitude is still under investigation. Over.

[01:01:27:43]
CDR: I thought it was the center engine.

[01:01:27:48]
CC:  Yes, right.

[01:01:27:58]
CDR: Joe, do you have any word on what marks we had
     for [glossary:TLI]?

[01:01:28:04]
CC:  At the time of [glossary:TLI], as I recall, you had 6 seconds
     longer than the nominal burn which was 3 seconds
     longer than the B-sigma low burn, and you were
     also GO for a second-opportunity [glossary:TLI] if we had required one.

[01:01:28:24]
CDR: Okay, we were just wondering because it appeared
     to us that we had a longer [glossary:TLI] burn than had been
     predicted.

[01:01:28:30]
CC:  Yes, you did. We confirmed that - that - that
     cut-off time just about as you saw it, and I don't
     have an explanation for it, but it was within the
     B-sigma margin.

[01:01:29:49]

     answers were clear and satisfactory, and we thank
     you very much. You can press on with the rest of

CC:  13, Houston. Go ahead.

[01:02:29:18]
LMP: Okay, Joe. Out window 5, I just picked up the
     tumbling object again so, for sure, it must have
     been a [glossary:SLA] panel. I don't think we could still
     be in the proximity of the S-IV at this time.

[01:02:29:33]
_extra : END OF TAPE/nPsge 72
CC:  I don't think so, Fred. It's several hundred
     miles aft of you. 700 miles is - is the number,
     I'm told. And since the [glossary:SLA] panel didn't make the
     midcourse correction, that might be it.

[01:02:29:51]
_page : 79
_tape : Tape 18/1
LMP: Yes, it's, I can't really tell for sure even
     through the monocular that it is, but it looks
     the same relative position to the stars. And
     the best I can tell about the same intensity and
     still about the same distance from us.

[01:02:30:08]
CC:  Can you see it tumbling. Does it have a shape,
     or is it a point?

[01:02:30:19]
LMP: No. I can tell it's tumbling; I guess the flat
     side not only is facing me, it's not only much
     brighter, it also grows larger.

[01:02:30:34]
CC:  Okay. Very interesting. We'll see if we can
     figure out where that's relative to you. They
     keep updating the S-IV impact on us a little bit.
     The last guess we had was that it will impact
     about the same longitude we gave you but close
     to zero latitude and a little bit later. You
     still won't be able to see it. And they're saying it might make a - -

[01:02:31:02]
LMP: Roger.

[01:02:31:03]
CC:  - - they're saying it might make a 100 to 120 foot
     crater, too.

[01:02:31:13]
LMP: It'll still be past the terminator for us for
     awhile.

[01:02:31:19]
CC:  Right. It will be at about the REV 20 terminator,
     so it will be late in your lunar orbit activities
     before you will be able to photograph it, and
     FAO is looking at whether we can work that in
     or not.

CDR: Just a passing comment, Joe. We're having lunch
     right now, and I just made myself a hotdog
     sandwich with catsup. Very tasty and almost
     unheard of in the old days.

[01:04:00:07]
CC:  That's correct, 13. As I recall the flight plan,
     you're supposed to put mustard on the hot dogs
     and not catsup, but I guess we'll overlook that.

[01:04:00:18]
CMP: We blew it.

[01:04:00:20]

CC:  The two additional comments were just that,
     first of all, they biased DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> by
     minus 0.34 feet per second based on your [glossary:EMS] null
     bias cheeks. That's just for information. And
     the second one also for information is that your
     targeted pericynthion is 60 miles after this
     correction.

[01:04:53:25]
LMP: Okay, understand. For Jack's information the
     [glossary:EMS] DELTA-V bias is 3.4, and our targeted
     pericynthion after this maneuver is 60 miles.

[01:04:53:41]
CC:  That's correct on the pericynthion. The [glossary:EMS]
     bias is 0.34, very small.

CC:  Right. That's coming in real well.

[01:06:16:51]
CDR: The objects in the foreground are parts of the
     [glossary:LM] that you're looking at.

[01:06:17:11]
CDR: The camera is now going to ...

[01:06:17:18]
CC:  We can just barely see those parts of the [glossary:LM].
     They must be in a shadow.

[01:06:17:34]
CDR: Okay. Now you are looking at a thruster quad at
     the lower part of your screen.

[01:06:17:41]
LMP: I've got the f-stop all the way open now, Vance;
     that's quad - quad 1 you're looking at with the
     [glossary:LM] should - The Moon should be in view just over
     the top of the quad.

[01:06:17:58]
CC:  Right. We see the nozzle of the quad, but it's
     dark and it's not easy to see.

[01:06:18:28]
CC:  13, Houston. [glossary:INCO] suggests you try AVERAGE if
     you're in PEAK to see if that gives us a better
     picture.

[01:06:18:41]
LMP: Okay. We're in AVERAGE now.

[01:06:19:02]
CC:  I think that helps out. We can see it better.

[01:06:19:23]
CC:  Okay. Now, 13, request you either move it away
     from the bright area or else move it back to PEAK.
     Over.

[01:06:20:08]
LMP: Okay, Vance. I cranked the focus down a little
     bit. Is the quad coming in any better now?

[01:06:20:17]
CC:  It's coming in about the same, Fred, and you're
     a little weak now on the COMM.

[01:06:20:32]
CC:  We could see when you went back to PEAK.

[01:06:20:38]
LMP: And I'm now ... all the way out.

[01:06:20:50]
CC:  Okay. We could see you zoom in on the Moon, and
     it's near the center of our screen, just a little
     to the left. Very clear.

[01:06:21:09]
LMP: Yes. I show it just about at 38.

[01:06:21:16]
CC:  We can't tell if it's gray or light brown, though.

[01:06:21:33]
LMP: Do you have your grid down there, Vance?

[01:06:21:43]
_page : 87
_tape : Tape 20/4
CC:  That's negative, Fred.

[01:06:21:48]
LMP: Okay.

[01:06:22:31]
LMP: I don't know if you can make out the features
     there, Vance, on the Moon, but it looks like the
     terminators are at central plains area somewhere
     around Descartes, maybe.

[01:06:22:45]
CC:  Okay. We're - We see it just as a bright portion
     of the lunar disk, and it looks a lot like you
     see it from Earth. Very bright. We are unable
     to see any features at all.

[01:06:23:09]
LMP: It's pretty much the same with the eyeballs in
     here, and it looks a little bigger now. But the
     only way I could see it very good at all was with
     the monocular, a little while ago.

[01:06:23:31]
CC:  Okay, Fred. Very good. We'd be interested to
     seeing the cabin when you get ready for that, too.

[01:06:23:39]
LMP: Okay. I'll set up now.

[01:06:23:59]
CDR: And, Vance, we're counting down to midcourse-2,
     we're up to, in our checklist, to minus 6 minutes
     to go.

[01:06:24:08]
CC:  Roger. Minus 6 minutes. Understand you're about
     ready to turn on the gimbal motors and all that
     sort of thing. Okay. We see the computer now in
     the upper middle part of the - the panel. I think
     we see somebody's checklist in the center couch.
     It must be Jim holding the checklist.

[01:06:24:39]
LMP: Right. And what Jim's holding now, he's got a
     pen in his hand we've rigged on a string, as sort
     of a simple-minded accelerometer. This burn's
     pretty short and I'm not sure even that's going
     to show very much. But we'll see if it'll stretch
     out at the end of its string.

[01:06:25:02]
CC:  Yes. We see the pencil at the top of the picture
     floating around. And Jack's coming into view now.

[01:06:25:10]
LMP: And I've gone back - Okay, I've gone back to
     AVERAGE now and ... pitch up.

[01:06:25:18]
CC:  Roger.

[01:06:28:08]
LMP: Now in a few minutes, Vance, I guess we'll see
     how about the only system we haven't used yet
     works. Everything else sure has worked mighty
     fine.

[01:06:28:20]
_page : 88
_tape : Tape 20/5
CC:  Right. The spacecraft's really working nicely.
     Okay. We're picking up panel 2 now. Still a
     little bit of the checklist.

[01:06:28:57]
LMP: Wondering if you can pick up the caution array
     there?

[01:06:29:00]
CC:  Right. We just saw your - your testing of the
     caution and warning system at the left-hand side
     of the panel on our TV. See the lights all flash
     on. You're doing it again.

[01:06:29:54]
CC:  You mission timer's showing up as a - a brilliant
     green in the upper left-hand part of the picture.

[01:06:30:12]
LMP: Roger. I got the camera kind of canted on you
     here, Vance.

[01:06:30:19]
CMP: Vance, Jim's going to go to VOX now.

[01:06:30:22]
CDR: Vance, how do you - -

[01:06:30:23]
CC:  Roger. Read you loud and clear, Jim.

[01:06:30:28]
CDR: Okay. We'll - what we'll do - We'll be on VOX
     for the remainder of the burn and preburn countdown.

[01:06:30:38]

[01:06:30:40]
CDR: ... And what we're waiting for is 54 minutes on
     our counter or 20 which would be minus - -

[01:06:30:58]
CC:  Jim, we hear clipping on your VOX. Could you
     adjust it so that you're coming in continuously
     all the time?

[01:06:31:08]
CDR: Okay. Stand by 1.

[01:06:31:17]
CDR: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. How's that, Vance?

[01:06:31:21]

[01:06:32:07]

[01:06:33:00]
LMP: Is that too close, Vance, or can you make out
     the [glossary:SPS] engine panel now?

[01:06:33:06]
CC:  We can see your fuel and oxidizer gages and
     hydrogen/oxygen gages at the top of the picture
     and the PUGS, but it isn't coming in in focus too
     well. It's a little dim.

[01:06:33:20]
LMP: Yes. I think the problem is I'm about 2 feet
     and it doesn't go down but to 4.

[01:06:33:32]
CC:  Right. We understand that's the panel right in
     front of your face.

[01:06:33:43]

[01:06:33:49]
LMP: Okay. We're minus 7 minutes.

[01:06:34:25]

     the position of your four ball valves at the top
     of the picture for the big [glossary:SPS] engine.

[01:06:42:13]
LMP: Okay. Fuel is 1.0; oxidizer 0.25; the OX unbalance is reading on the decrease, which doesn't
     mean very much, and I guess that wasn't too much
     for a push there, Vance. I didn't see the accelerometer do a whole lot and it was a little surprising how slowly the injector valves opened,
     at least on the indicators.

[01:06:42:44]
CC:  Roger. That was a very short burn. Request you
     give us a sweep across the panel when you get a

CMP: Okay, Vance, I was going to show you on - wonder
     if the folks might - down there might be interested in how we find out how far we're away from
     the Moon. Going to do that right now in program 21 here.

[01:06:43:09]
CC:  Okay.

[01:06:43:11]
CMP: I'm asking the computer how far away we are. And
     the computer is telling me we're 121 490 miles out.

[01:06:43:21]
_page : 95
_tape : Tape 20/12
CC:  Okay. That agrees fairly closely with our map
     on the wall.

[01:06:43:30]
CMP: I'm glad. That means you're tracking us too.

[01:06:43:38]
CDR: And if you didn't see our residuals, it was 0.1 X,
     0.2 on Y, and 0.1 Z, and DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> was minus 3.8.

[01:06:44:01]
CC:  Jack, Houston. We show you down here 121 thousand miles 520 out. So I guess we all agree.

[01:06:44:12]
CMP: Okay. Real good, Vance. What I'm going to do is
     give you a shot of Fred.

[01:06:44:23]
LMP: If we can get all the wiring out of the way.

[01:06:44:27]
CMP: The big problem here is, when you move the TV
     around, this wire follows you like a snake here.

[01:06:44:35]
CC:  Yes, we have Fred now. Looks like he has a
     lariat there, getting ready to rope the checklist.

[01:06:44:47]
LMP: That's only half of it. We have most of it
     hidden away. It's been pretty interesting doing
     all the camera work here to get a little extra
     training running the TV here, hopefully for when
     we get on the ground at Fra Mauro. The monitor
     does make it pretty easy though.

[01:06:45:12]
CC:  Right. That's a real advantage in the cockpit.
     You're just a little bit dark. It looks like it
     might help to have the f-stop run down about one
     increment. See how it comes out - -

[01:06:45:26]
LMP: Can't do it, we're wide open.

[01:06:46:18]

     hair?

[01:06:46:21]

     comb your hair up here.

[01:06:46:27]
CC:  Well, I guess you have to give up something.

[01:06:46:36]
CC:  Well, at least it - it helps to try. We can see
     you trying to comb your hair there, Jim. It looks
     like your - your beards haven't come along to the
     point where you've had to use the razor though.

[01:06:46:51]
CDR: Well, we've been debating that. We thought we'd
     take care of our beards tomorrow and make that
     one of our daily routines.

[01:06:47:06]
LMP: I take it that was a subtle hint, Vance.

[01:06:47:11]
CC:  No, no. We're not commenting on your appearance,
     Fred. I mean nothing derogatory, understand.

[01:06:47:20]
CDR: And, Vance, thought we'd get a picture of Jack
     just so that all the girls know that he's still
     here.

[01:06:47:30]
CMP: (Laughter)

[01:06:47:31]
CDR: ...

[01:06:47:34]
CC:  Yes, we - we appreciate that. There he is. Big
     Jack.

[01:06:47:57]
CC:  Jack, you're in the shadow right now; we have a
     little bit of interference from your window, which
     is very bright, so we can't - I think you're
     smiling, but it's a little hard to tell.

[01:06:48:11]
CDR: ...

[01:06:48:12]
_page : 97
_tape : Tape 20/14
CC:  Hey, there we go. Incidentally, we've been
     getting all kinds of bits of information to pass
     up to you. We've had baseball scores coming in,
     basketball. Somebody said there's 220 days,
     shopping days left until Christmas.

[01:06:48:46]
CMP: Yes. Who won the Masters, Vance?

[01:06:48:56]
CC:  It was a tie in the Masters and stand by. It
     was a tie between Littler and Casper after
     72 holes, and there is going to be a playoff
     Monday, we understand.

[01:06:49:16]
CMP: Oh. Sounds good.

[01:06:49:35]
CC:  One thing the world might be interested in
     knowing is what you do after the burn in the way
     of configuring switches back. We - We heard you
     go through the checklist. But, I guess right
     now, basically, you probably have all the switches
     back in position and you're in the mode to continue on with - Okay. What does the flight plans
     say? You're going to be doing cislunar navigation. So, Jack you're going to be down in the
     [glossary:LEB]. Is that correct?

[01:06:50:12]
CMP: That's right, Vance. Be going down there shortly.

[01:06:50:30]
CC:  Okay. The TV now is all but black. Looks like
     it must be pointing into a shadow.

[01:06:50:39]
CMP: What he's doing, he's trying to give you one more
     shot of the Moon, and right now I'm setting to
     maneuver pad and the optics calibration attitude.

[01:06:50:47]
CC:  Roger.

[01:06:50:55]
LMP: And what I wanted to point out, I don't know if
     it's apparent, but ... to show the advantage of
     doing all the dumps just before the burn, we're
     looking again at the same scene over quad 1 at
     the Moon. And now you don't see all the sparkly
     frozen particles outside there any more. We've
     sort of run off and left them.

[01:06:51:22]
CC:  Roger. We - We don't see anything out there anymore in the way of particles leaving the spacecraft. We'd suggest, maybe you zoom the Moon in
     a little bit again so we can see the shape of it
     better.

[01:06:51:59]
_page : 98
_tape : Tape 20/15
CC:  Okay. That brings the Moon in. We can see the
     terminator at the top of the melon-shaped disk.

[01:06:52:11]
LMP: Okay. Now you can see a few of the spark -
     sparkling particles going across the screen.
     Those are being emitted from the thrusters.
     Jack's maneuvering the spacecraft now.

[01:06:52:34]
CC:  Okay. We can see those very poorly. Well,
     actually, they are coming in better now. It
     looks like little specks going from the upper
     left part of the screen across to the right, and
     understand those are from the thrusters.

[01:06:52:52]
LMP: That's affirm.

[01:06:54:12]
CC:  Okay, 13; Houston. Just as an item of interest,
     advise your speed with respect to the Earth is
     now 4667 feet per second.

[01:06:54:29]
CMP: Okay. Thanks, Vance.

[01:06:55:01]
CC:  Okay, Apollo 13; Houston. The Moon has been in
     and out of the - the - our screen here. Right
     now it's off at the bottom side, but we can still
     see the particles coming off of the spacecraft.

[01:06:55:20]
CMP: Okay. I am going to have to pull it out the
     window now, Vance. The Sun's coming up on the
     right side.

[01:06:55:26]
CC:  Roger. Understand. You - -

[01:06:55:27]
CDR: Do you want to see any shots down in the [glossary:LEB],
     Vance?

[01:06:55:31]
CC:  Say again.

[01:06:55:35]
CDR: Do you want to see any of the photographs or do
     you want the TV down in the [glossary:LEB]?

[01:06:55:40]
CC:  That's right, Jim. It would be good to see what
     you are doing down in the [glossary:LEB] or the far corner
     of the spacecraft where the optics are. Might be
     interesting to describe what you will do in the
     next few minutes in the way of sighting.

[01:06:55:59]
LMP: Okay, Vance. First we are going to give you a
     shot of the sleep station.

[01:06:56:22]
_page : 99
_tape : Tape 20/16
CC:  Okay. The camera's bounced around a little, but
     we can see the green computer come in every once
     in a while.

[01:06:56:59]
CDR: While Jack is getting the sleep station rolled
     up, I thought I would show you one interesting
     corner. We've got a temporary stowage bag here
     and that's where all our wastepaper and all that
     goes while we're - after every meal. It's in
     the right-hand corner down by our dump system.

[01:06:57:16]
CC:  Roger. Understand. We're looking at the
     wastebasket.

[01:06:57:26]
CDR: And the age-old question that is always asked us
     is how do we get rid of liquid waste and that
     line that you see, I think you can see it now,
     it goes right outside where we open up the overboard drain dump, and all of our waste products,
     liquid waste products, go out through that line
     and get dumped overboard.

[01:06:57:45]
CC:  Roger. Understand, and we can see somebody's
     foot, as well.

[01:06:57:51]
CDR: Okay. Fred is now going down there, and he is
     going to try to get underneath the sleep station
     on his side where we have a sleep restraint. And
     the whole object of that is to ... to position
     the body between the - between the bottom of the
     spacecraft and - so it doesn't float up between
     that and the bottom of the couch.

[01:06:58:14]
CC:  Roger. The sleep restraint of the hammock is
     coming into view underneath the couch. It's the
     white object.

[01:06:58:27]
CDR: You perhaps can see the zipper of the hammock
     right now. It's the black lines in that white
     object.

[01:06:58:34]
CC:  Right. We can see it.

[01:06:58:39]
CDR: These hammocks, by the way, are very comfortable.
     When we first heard about them in the design of
     Apollo, we thought they weren't necessary, but
     they turned out to be very nice devices to sleep
     in.

[01:06:59:15]
CDR: I'm trying now to get down there with Fred to show
     you how it works. I keep floating up, though,
     but maybe we can get a little shot here.

[01:06:59:42]
_page : 100
_tape : Tape 20/17
CC:  Okay. We have somebody upside down in the
     photograph now. Realizing, of course, in - in
     space there is no really rightside up or upside
     down. It still looks that way to us.

[01:07:00:10]
CDR: Okay. That's - That's Fred now. I'm trying to
     put him rightside up, for you folks back there in
     the sleep station. Fred, would you move your
     hands there so the folks back home can see you?

[01:07:00:23]
CC:  Okay. That's coming in real clear, Jim. We see
     Fred in the sleep restaint - restraint.

[01:07:00:36]
CDR: As a matter of fact, Vance, I find my - I find
     Fred down there all the time.

[01:07:00:44]
CC: Yes. I can see he appreciates that. Looks
     fairly comfortable.

[01:07:01:08]
CC:  Looks like there is a lot of room down there,
     considering all the boxes on the floor and underneath the couch.

[01:07:01:16]
CDR: It's surprising. There still is quite a bit of
     room down there even with the Hycon camera box
     down. And now, I'm going to bring the camera
     back up.

[01:07:01:55]
CDR: Okay, Vance. If there is no more that you would
     like to see right now, we'll terminate our little
     TV for you today.

[01:07:02:01]
CC:  Okay. Thank you very much, Jim. Appreciated
     seeing inside the spacecraft and getting a look
     at the Moon that you're rapidly approaching.

[01:07:02:13]
CDR: Roger. This is Odyssey saying goodby.

[01:07:05:36]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston.

[01:07:05:41]
LMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[01:07:05:44]
CC:  Okay. At your convenience we have an item to
     give you which will have to be copied. It's
     information on how to photograph Comet Bennett
     at time 32 hours [glossary:GET]. Over.

[01:07:06:02]
LMP: Okay. Stand by 1 minute.

[01:07:06:03]
CC:  Okay.

[01:07:07:02]
LMP: Okay, Vance. Go ahead.

[01:07:07:06]
_page : 101
_tape : Tape 20/18
CC:  Okay. Time 32 hours 00 minutes [glossary:GET]. Instructions
     at completion of [glossary:P23], maneuver to following attitude: roll 101.0, pitch 090.0, yaw 000.0. High
     gain antenna angles will be: pitch minus 23,
     yaw 93. Use normal [glossary:PTC] procedures to dampen rates.
     After vehicle's stable, and before spinup, take
     photographs of Comet Bennett. Use the [glossary:DAC] on the
     sextant with magazine G. That is, very high-speed
     black-and-white film, right? That's the dim-light
     film. Take three photos, one each at 5-, 20-, and
     60-seconds' time exposure. Use AUTO optics.
     [glossary:NOUN 88] values are R<sub>1</sub> plus 34717, R<sub>2</sub> minus 08028;
     R<sub>3</sub> plus 35075. Take three photos one each at 5-,
     20-, and 60-second time exposure using manual
     optics. Shaft will be 000.8 degrees, trunnion
     12.5 degrees. Comment: Strip off about 50 frames;
     that is, 2 seconds of - at 24 feet per second before the first frame and after the last frame of
     the photos. That is, 2 second - 2 seconds at
     24 frames per second - before the first frame and
     after the last frame of photos.

[01:07:07:13]
LMP: Is that it, Vance?

[01:07:11:15]
CC:  And that's all.

[01:07:11:19]
LMP: Okay. The time is - The event will be at [time:01:08:00:00|32:00];
     and we're to maneuver to the following attitude;
     roll 101.0, pitch 090.0, yaw all zips. High
     gain angles will be pitch minus 23, yaw 93. And
     we're to use normal [glossary:PTC] procedures to damp the
     rates. And after damping the rates and before
     spinup, we're to put the [glossary:DAC] on the sextant with
     the magazine G, very high-speed black and white
     film. Then, we're to take three photos, one each
     at 5-, 20-, and 60-seconds' time exposure using
     audio - AUTO optics. Our [glossary:NOUN 88] values R<sub>1</sub>
     plus 34717, R<sub>2</sub> minus 08028, R<sub>3</sub> plus 35075. Thence,
     three more photos, one each at 5-, 20-, 60-seconds'
     time exposure using manual optics. Shaft 0.8 degrees, trunnion 12.5 degrees. And we're to take
     2 - second bursts at 24 frames per second, before
     and after these pictures.

[01:07:20:18]

[01:07:20:21]
CC:  Jim, for [glossary:PTC] tonight, request that you disable
     quads C and D. That's the opposite of last night.
     Over.

[01:07:20:36]
CDR: Okay. For [glossary:PTC] tonight, disable quads C and D.

[01:07:20:40]

     have some read-ups whenever you're ready to take
     them regarding solo book changes.

[01:07:20:53]

[01:07:30:54]
CC:  Go ahead, 13.

[01:07:31:00]
LMP: Have you all got a chance to look at the data on
     the [glossary:SPS] yet?

[01:07:31:06]
CC:  Stand by 1, Fred.

[01:07:31:40]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston.

[01:07:31:44]
LMP: Go ahead.

[01:07:31:47]
CC:  Fred, it looks good, but they haven't had a chance
     to evaluate everything. They'll probably be
     finished with looking at strip charts in about
     15 minutes, and after that we'll try to get back
     with you.

[01:07:32:01]
LMP: Okay. Thank you.

[01:07:36:48]
CMP: Go ahead.

[01:07:36:50]
CC:  On the [glossary:P33], just like to verify that you changed
     the [glossary:NOUN 88] values for this last star. It looks
     like they haven't been changed. Over.

[01:07:37:06]
_page : 103
_tape : Tape 21/2
CMP: Okay, Vance.

[01:07:37:10]
CDR: That's better. Let's read you what we - what we
     have. We have what they had in the flight plan,
     and if it's been changed from the flight plan,
     we don't have it.

[01:07:37:29]
CC:  Stand by 1.

[01:07:38:09]
CDR: We think you're right, Vance. It looks like they
     used the same set of [glossary:NOUN 88] for both stars by
     mistake.

[01:07:38:16]
CC:  Okay, very good.

[01:07:44:04]
CMP: Okay, Vance. That ought to complete the [glossary:P23]s,
     right?

[01:07:44:07]
CC:  Okay. Very good, Jack.

[01:07:44:37]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston.

[01:07:44:42]
CMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[01:07:44:44]
CC:  We have some results on your - your first star,
     if you'd like to hear them. The rest of the stars
     we'll - we'll have to give you in a couple of
     hours. Over.

[01:07:44:58]
CMP: Go ahead.

[01:07:44:59]
CC:  Okay, the first star: the corrected altitude,
     15 kilometers plus or minus 4; effective altitude,
     12 kilometers plus or minus 7. As far as the
     substellar point, the value is arc-minutes -
     2 arc-minutes, and that's very good. And, like
     I said, we'll get back with you in a couple of
     hours for the rest.

[01:07:56:31]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston.

[01:07:56:36]
CMP: Go ahead.

[01:07:56:37]
CDR: Go ahead.

[01:07:56:38]
CC:  Okay. We have several items, here. First, is a
     reminder on the [glossary:PTC] that R<sub>1</sub> should be 375 -
     0.375 degrees as last night, to get 0.3-degree
     rotation rate. The second one - -

[01:07:57:00]
CMP: Okay. Copy that.

[01:07:57:02]
_page : 104
_tape : Tape 21/3
CC:  Okay. The second one, at 32 hours looking at
     Bennett's Comet - we want the pictures taken when
     the spacecraft is as stable as it's going to be
     before starting [glossary:PTC]. The stability requirement
     is very high. We weren't sure if you understood
     that from what we passed up. In addition, the
     photographs might not show as much as the eye
     can see of the comet, so if you see anything
     interesting about the structure of the comet,
     why, sketching it is in order and is encouraged.
     Over.

[01:07:57:50]
CMP: Okay, Vance. What we'll do is, when we get to
     attitude, we'll disable the quads and do like we
     did last night; we'll let [glossary:GUIDO] and you people
     down there tell us when you think we are stable
     enough; then we'll do all this work with the [glossary:DAC]
     on the sextant, first; and then when we get that
     done, we'll go back and put the sextant eyepiece
     back on and see what we can observe visually.

[01:07:58:18]
CC:  Okay. That sounds good. Also, while you are
     waiting for the vehicle to stabilize, it might
     be interesting to have the eyepiece on and be
     looking at it visually. Okay. Next item: your
     [glossary:SPS] burn had no anomalies whatsoever. It was a
     very good burn.

[01:07:58:52]
CMP: Okay. Very good.

[01:07:58:55]
CC:  Next item: request hydrogen tank 1 HEATER OFF for
     balancing purposes.

[01:07:59:22]
CC:  And Apollo 13, another item: something that we
     have observed and you might be seeing is a slight
     TCE fluctuation on fuel cell 3. This fluctuation
     has been going from about 152 to 160 over a
     37-second period. It has been seen on other
     flights in the past. No one is worried about it,
     but the usual fluctuation is about 1-1/2 degrees
     instead of 7 seconds, so I thought you should be
     aware of it.

[01:08:00:07]
CMP: Okay, Vance. And one other slight distinction
     we've noted is the flow of hydrogen versus the
     oxygen is not exactly matched on fuel cell 3
     either.

[01:08:00:26]
CC:  Okay. We copy. And the last item: we'd like
     to send you an IRIG update, so at your convenience,
     request [glossary:P00] and ACCEPT.

[01:08:00:46]
_page : 105
_tape : Tape 21/4
CMP: Okay. We are in [glossary:P00] and ACCEPT, Vance.

[01:08:00:49]
CC:  Okay.

[01:08:01:20]
CMP: Quad C and D are disabled, Vance.

[01:08:01:24]
CC:  Roger. Disabled. And down here, we see that
     your hydrogen and oxygen on the fuel cell are
     exactly matched, so we suspect it's purely a
     spacecraft read-out problem.

[01:08:01:40]
CMP: Okay.

[01:08:04:26]
CMP: Okay, Vance, let us know when you're through with
     the [glossary:DSKY] so we can load [glossary:NOUN 88]?

[01:08:04:40]
CC:  Roger. We'll let you know, Jack.

[01:08:05:22]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston. The computer's yours, again.

[01:08:10:56]
CC:  Okay. You're go for the pictures.

[01:08:11:01]
CMP: Okay, Vance. We tried our AUTO OPTICS and couldn't
     pick it up there. We're pointing pretty much
     right into the Sun, and things are pretty well
     washed out. And I've gone to MANUAL OPTICS and
     I'm trying to get 0.8, 12.5 on the shaft and
     trunnion, and I still can't pick it up. So -
     it's very light in the sextant, so I kind of think
     maybe we're too near the Sun to see it.

[01:08:11:28]
CDR: That's right, Vance. The sextant is all - it's -
     it's all milky and it - any comet that could be
     seen through there is just going to be missed in
     the background.

[01:08:11:41]
CC:  Okay, we copy that. We got some discussion.
     Stand by.

[01:08:13:35]
CMP: Okay, Vance, it isn't - we're not looking into the
     Sun - what we are getting is a large reflection
     from the Sun behind us off the [glossary:LM]; and it is -
     it is coming on that quad 1 there, and that quad
     is reflecting back into the sextant.

[01:08:13:54]
CC:  Okay, Jack. Understand. Just a question: if you
     look through the telescope, can you see the comet
     at all? Over.

[01:08:14:07]
CMP: No, I can't, Vance. It's - it's still too light.

[01:08:14:35]
_page : 106
_tape : Tape 21/5
CC:  Stand by.

[01:08:17:45]
LMP: Say, Vance?

[01:08:17:50]
CC:  Roger. Go ahead.

[01:08:17:55]
LMP: Are the flowers blooming yet?

[01:08:18:00]
CC:  Gee, I sure haven't seen any.

[01:08:18:04]
LMP: Okay.

[01:08:18:05]
CC:  Hey, we've - we've got quite a discussion down
     here on your trying to observe the comet, and this
     reflection is not unexpected. And give us another
     minute, and we'll be back with you on something
     on that.

[01:08:18:26]
CDR: Okay. I doubt very seriously though, if we take
     any photographs with high-speed black and white
     with the light coming into the sextant that you're
     going to get anything out of it.

[01:08:18:42]
CC:  Okay. Unanimous opinion is that you're right, and
     we'll scratch all of this Bennett Comet stuff on
     the way out, with the hope that conditions will
     be more favorable after [glossary:TEI]. Over.

[01:08:19:04]
CDR: Sounds good. Without the [glossary:LM], we may have a better
     chance.

[01:08:19:10]
CC:  Roger.

[01:08:19:29]
CC:  And Apollo 13, you're GO for [glossary:PTC]. Your rates are
     very low according to what we can read.

[01:08:19:38]
CDR: Roger, Vance.

[01:08:22:24]
LMP: Okay. Are you going to give a call on OMNI B,
     Vance?

[01:08:22:42]
LMP: Do you read, Vance?

[01:08:22:43]
CC:  Roger. Go ahead. Request OMNI B, Fred, and
     secure the high-gain antenna.

[01:08:22:53]
LMP: Okay. You got it.

[01:08:22:55]
CC:  Okay.

[01:08:43:21]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston.

[01:08:43:25]
_page : 107
_tape : Tape 21/6
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[01:08:43:27]
CC:  Just something to think about. In about 30 minutes,
     we can generate the pads that we have yet to
     send up before the sleep period, so we could support an earlier sleep period if you so desired.
     And - but, it will take us 30 minutes to get that
     stuff. The other thing is any time you're ready
     to copy, I can read up the solo book changes.
     Over - And, also, two pages in the flight plan.

[01:08:44:01]
CDR: Okay, Vance. We're about ready to copy the solo
     book changes and the flight plan changes, and
     whenever your pads are ready, we'll take those.
     And as far as moving up the sleep period, that's
     fine, but we'll - if we don't go to sleep right
     away, we'll use it to get out some of our lunar
     maps and study them.

[01:08:44:21]
CC:  Okay. And we'll get busy getting those pads for
     you as soon as possible then, and I'll stand by
     on the copying bit.

[01:08:47:28]
_extra : END OF TAPE
CDR: Okay, Vance, I'm ready to copy the solo book
     changes there.

[01:08:47:37]
_page : 108
_tape : Tape 22/1
CC:  Okay. First, turn to page 12. On the right-hand
     side of the page, starting from the middle of
     the page down, everything under "Cycle 5 frames,
     Replace dark side or dark slide" should be deleted
     until you get to the very bottom of the page
     where you have "Acquisition [glossary:MSFN] OMNI D" and
     that should remain in. Also, leave in "Remove
     window shades," which is about the third line
     down from where you start.

[01:08:48:37]
CMP: Okay. Okay. Then from "Cycle 5 frames, Replace
     dark slide," from there on down, delete.

[01:08:48:50]
CC:  That's everything from there on down, with the
     exception of "Remove window shades" and at the
     bottom "Acquisition [glossary:MSFN] OMNI D."

[01:08:49:10]
CMP: Okay. Copy.

[01:08:49:12]
CC:  And that includes in the margin to the left, the
     "[glossary:DAP] load" that's at the very start there and
     the "0.0507" and "plus 0500," farther down.

[01:08:49:31]
CMP: Okay. Got it.

[01:08:49:34]
CC:  Okay. Going to page 13.

[01:08:49:39]
CMP: Okay.

[01:08:49:42]
CC:  Okay, in the left margin, just below 105 hours
     [glossary:GET], cross out the "0507" and the "plus 0500,"
     and below that, add in "[glossary:DAP] load" as follows:
     "10111 and 11111."

[01:08:50:11]
CMP: Okay. Got it.

[01:08:50:13]
CC:  Okay. Now, next, at about 105:05, there's a
     "[glossary:VERB 48]." That should be moved up to 105, and
     below that, the "[glossary:VERB 49] maneuver" should be
     moved up, too.

[01:08:50:42]
CMP: Okay. That "VERB 48" should be moved up to
     105:05 and also the "VERB 49."

[01:08:50:50]
CC:  That should be moved up to 105:00. I'm sorry.
     Both.

[01:08:50:56]
_page : 109
_tape : Tape 22/2
CMP: Okay.

[01:08:50:57]
CC:  And what that does is give you more time to
     maneuver.

[01:08:51:07]
CC:  Okay. Next.

[01:08:51:09]
CMP: All right.

[01:08:51:10]
CC:  Page 14, right-hand side, near the bottom under
     "Orbital Science," scratch out "Verify [glossary:DSE] ON,"
     and also delete "Visual target 3 on track 180
     plus 19," and cross out the penned-in "D5."

[01:08:51:43]
CMP: Okay. Got it.

[01:08:51:46]
CC:  Next, page 15, left-hand column, or left-hand
     side, rather, near the bottom, where it says
     "Configure cameras and tape" and goes down
     through "Replace dark slide." Just make the
     comment there, "Solar corona is optional." Over.

[01:08:52:16]
CMP: Okay. Got it.

[01:08:52:19]
CC:  Okay, next page, 16. This is a continuation of
     the same solar-corona thing. On the right-hand
     side of the page, starting just above 107:40
     with "[glossary:VERB 49], maneuver to solar-corona attitude,"
     from there on down to 107:55 just beneath "Replace
     dark slide," all of this is in an optional category. So you just might line off - -

[01:08:53:03]
CMP: All right. Got it.

[01:08:53:04]
CC:  - - that and put "Optional, solar corona."
     Okay, next, page 17 - -

[01:08:53:12]
CMP: Okay.

[01:08:53:13]
CC:  - - starting at 108:00 on the left-hand side,
     line out "Stop ORB rate at ORB science attitude."
     At - Line out in the left-hand column the [glossary:DAP]
     load of "10101" and "11111." Going down to
     108:10, add in the following: "Stop ORB rate at
     track attitude," and, in parentheses, "0, 353, 0."
     In the left-hand - -

[01:08:54:14]
CMP: Okay.

[01:08:54:15]
_page : 110
_tape : Tape 22/3
CC:  Okay, in the left-hand column under 108:10, put
     in a [glossary:DAP] load in parentheses of "10101" and,
     under that, "11111."

[01:08:54:33]
CMP: Okay.

[01:08:54:35]
CC:  Beneath that, scratch out "Spacecraft control
     dash [glossary:CMC] AUTO verify." Scratch out the "[glossary:VERB 79]"
     and all in parentheses after that, like the
     "Minus 00507," et cetera. And beneath that,
     scratch out "PRO to start pitch rate." In parentheses, "0, 230 slash 018, 0."

[01:08:55:10]
CMP: Okay.

[01:08:55:12]
CC:  Okay. Looking to the right, the [glossary:LM] attitude or
     rather the [glossary:CSM] attitude will be incorrect, so
     you can cross that off. And beneath the picture
     of the moon, cross out the - in parentheses,
     "108.19" and the "0 230/018, 0"

[01:08:55:39]
CMP: All right.

[01:08:55:41]
CC:  On the right-hand half of the page, cross out
     the "Orbital science block," and under that
     "Visual target 1 south of track TR." And under
     that, the penned-in "D2/3/4."

[01:08:56:08]
CMP: All right. Got it.

[01:08:56:09]
CC:  And beneath that, cross out "[glossary:VERB 49], maneuver
     to track attitude" by the "'C' 0, 353, 0" and
     the "HU,SCF."

[01:08:56:28]
CMP: All right.

[01:08:56:30]
CC:  Okay. The information beneath that starting
     with "Configure camera earthshine photos" down
     through "Replace dark slides" is optional. So
     just put in "Earthshine optional" as a comment
     there, and in the camera settings, in the block
     that has "f:2.8 125, infinity," cross out the
     "125" and put in "one-eighth," 1 slash 8, in
     other words.

[01:08:57:18]
CMP: Okay, that last part was, cross out the "125"
     and put in "1/8." Is that right?

[01:08:57:25]
CC:  That's affirm. Okay. Next page. No change.
     Go to page 19.

[01:08:57:45]
_page : 111
_tape : Tape 22/4
CMP: Okay.

[01:08:57:49]
CC:  Okay. On the right-hand side, from the "[glossary:VERB 49],
     maneuver to earthshine attitude," down through
     everything up to "[glossary:MSFN] uplink," this is optional.
     This is "Earthshine optional."

[01:08:58:19]
CMP: All right. Got it.

[01:08:58:21]
CC:  And once again, a camera-setting correction up
     near the top of that section that we called
     optional, where you have "bracket MIR f:0.9, 125,"
     cross out the "125" and put in "1 slash 60."
     In other words, one-sixtieth. Over.

[01:08:58:46]
CMP: Okay. Cross out the "125" and put in "1 slash
     60."

[01:08:58:52]
CC:  That's correct. And further down at 109:50,
     where you have "Visual target 17," et cetera,
     cross out that line and cross out the penned-in
     "D17."

[01:08:59:18]
CMP: Okay.

[01:08:59:27]
CC:  Now, move to page 25.

[01:08:59:53]
CMP: Okay, go ahead, Vance.

[01:08:59:54]
CC:  Okay. At about 114:10, everything under "Altitude
     set equals 60 miles" should have the comment
     "Solar corona, optional," and on that first line
     of that optional where it says "[glossary:VERB 49], maneuver
     to solar corona and limb brightening attitude,"
     cross out "And limb brightening attitude."

[01:09:00:33]
CMP: Okay.

[01:09:00:35]
CC:  Going further down to 114:16, cross out the
     "14 [glossary:DAC] 18 VHBW limb brightening" line and the
     line under that which is "BRKT, MIR," et cetera.

[01:09:00:59]
CMP: All right.

[01:09:01:01]
CC:  In the block where it says "Solar corona and limb
     brightening photos," cross out "And limb brightening photos" and just put "Solar corona, optional."

[01:09:01:23]
CMP: Okay. Got it.

[01:09:01:25]
_page : 112
_tape : Tape 22/5
CC:  Going a few lines below that where you see "DAC
     ON for 4 seconds at about 50 frame rate cover
     lens," cross that out.

[01:09:01:50]
CMP: Hey, Vance, we lost you there, or did you ...?

[01:09:01:58]
CC:  Yes, I think we lost lock. We'll stand by a
     minute.

[01:09:02:03]
CMP: Okay, I got you back.

[01:09:02:07]
CC:  Okay. Going on down, cross out "114:29:16, [glossary:DAC]
     ON, SR dash 40 seconds."

[01:09:02:26]
CMP: Okay.

[01:09:02:27]
CC:  And at the very bottom line on that half of the
     page should be crossed out which is "114:29:56,
     [glossary:DAC] OFF, SR."

[01:09:02:42]
CMP: Okay.

[01:09:02:43]
CC:  On the right-hand side of page 25, where you
     have the title "Solar corona and limb brightening photography," cross out "limb brightening
     photography."

[01:09:02:57]
CMP: Okay.

[01:09:02:58]
CC:  And in the figure, where you have the "[glossary:DAC] [glossary:LOS]"
     line, which is parallel to the X-axis on the
     horizon, cross out "[glossary:DAC] [glossary:LOS]" parallel to X-axis
     on horizon.

[01:09:03:24]
CMP: All right.

[01:09:03:26]
CC:  And cross out the bottom block on that half of
     the page which is "[glossary:DAC] magazine percent required
     12 magazines, g," et cetera.

[01:09:03:42]
CMP: All right.

[01:09:03:45]
CC:  Next page, 26.

[01:09:03:57]
CMP: Go ahead.

[01:09:03:58]
CC:  Okay. Cross out the top line on the right-hand
     side of that page, which is "[glossary:DAC] on for 4 seconds,
     50 frame rate cover lens." And cross out the
     block to the right of that and down, which has
     "Magazine percent."

[01:09:04:35]
_page : 113
_tape : Tape 22/6
CMP: All right. Got it.

[01:09:04:40]
CC:  Okay. Next, page 28.

[01:09:05:08]
CC:  Ready to go?

[01:09:05:10]
CMP: Go ahead.

[01:09:05:11]
CC:  Okay. On the left-hand side of page 28, at the
     very bottom, cross out "Photo target 5 north,
     frame f:5.6, 215, infinity," et cetera. All of
     that line over to the vertical strip. And cross
     out the penned-in "E4" below that.

[01:09:06:02]
CMP: Okay, go ahead.

[01:09:06:04]
CC:  Okay, and the next page, 29, right-hand side near
     the top, cross out "Photo target 13, north at 5.6,
     250," et cetera, all of that line. And cross out
     beneath that the penned-in "E5 slash 6."

[01:09:06:27]
CMP: All right.

[01:09:06:29]
CC:  Going to page 30, next, left-hand side.

[01:09:06:45]
CMP: Go ahead.

[01:09:06:47]
CC:  At the top at 127:01, cross out "Visual target 9
     on track, 180 degrees, plus 0.47," and cross out
     the penned-in "E11" beneath that.

[01:09:07:08]
CMP: Okay.

[01:09:07:10]
CC:  Going down to 127:11, cross out "Verify [glossary:DSE] ON."
     Beneath that a ways, cross out "127:14:20, start
     visual observations of Fra Mauro."

[01:09:07:34]
CMP: All right.

[01:09:07:36]
CC:  Beneath that, cross out "Continue visual observations," and cross out "Stop observations." And
     beneath that, cross out "Photo target 56 on
     track f:8, 250, infinity, 5," et cetera, to the
     end of that line. Cross out the "5.6" beneath
     that and the penned-in "E15."

[01:09:08:12]
CMP: Okay.

[01:09:08:14]
CC:  Over in the margin, to the left of all that, make
     a comment: "Delete visual only."

[01:09:08:38]
_page : 114
_tape : Tape 22/7
CMP: Where was that, Vance? I didn't get that last
     one.

[01:09:08:42]
CC:  Okay. That's still on page 30, on the left-hand
     side. In the time - in the margin at the left
     where you have times, just pen in beneath the
     "127:10" the following: "Delete visual only."
     That's only a comment.

[01:09:09:04]
CMP: Okay. All right.

[01:09:09:12]
CC:  Okay. Going to page 34.

[01:09:09:27]
CMP: Okay.

[01:09:09:31]
CC:  About - on the left-hand side about almost halfway down beneath the "[glossary:VERB 49], maneuver to TOPO
     target 54A," make the comment "Target 54A is
     optional."

[01:09:09:54]
CMP: All right. Got it.

[01:09:09:56]
CC:  And, next, page 35, on the right-hand side.
     Everything from "Spacecraft control, [glossary:CMC], AUTO,
     verify" on down should be given the comment
     "Zodiacal light photos optional."

[01:09:10:32]
CMP: All right.

[01:09:10:35]
CC:  And, well, where you have the block in the middle
     of the page that says - the small block that says
     "Zodiacal light photos," just put "Optional" in
     that title, too.

[01:09:10:48]
CMP: Okay.

[01:09:10:50]
CC:  And, next, page 36, on the left-hand side.

[01:09:11:00]
CMP: Okay, go ahead.

[01:09:11:03]
CC:  Okay. First a comment. In the middle of the
     page is where the zodiacal light stuff ends,
     just under [glossary:VERB 48]. And then, if you'll go down
     to the bottom of the page, cross out the line
     "Photo target 12 on track," et cetera, and cross
     out the "E5" that is below that line.

[01:09:11:30]
CDR: Okay, Vance, can I break in a minute?

[01:09:11:33]
CC:  Sure.

[01:09:11:39]
_page : 115
_tape : Tape 22/8
CDR: We have the CRYO PRESSURE light on now. The H<sub>2</sub>
     has hit its lower bound, so do you want us to
     go back to AUTO on the H<sub>2</sub> HEATER 1?

[01:09:11:51]
CC:  Stand by.

[01:09:12:14]
CC:  13, Houston.

[01:09:12:18]
CDR: All right, go ahead.

[01:09:12:20]
CC:  They request that you leave that switch in the
     AUTO position until you go to bed tonight.
     Stand by. I mean in the ON position. I'll
     repeat that again. In the OFF position until
     you go to bed tonight for reasons that you have
     a 3-percent imbalance, and they'd like to get
     that more even. So, just before turning in,
     we'll change the switch to AUTO.

[01:09:12:54]
CDR: Okay.

[01:09:13:10]
CMP: Okay, Vance, continue.

[01:09:13:11]
CC:  Okay - -

[01:09:13:12]
CMP: Before we get away, would you ask FAO - something
     I didn't get briefed on - what the penned-in E5
     and those letters and numbers mean?

[01:09:13:31]
CC:  Okay. Just 1 minute.

[01:09:13:54]
CC:  Okay, we'll have comments on that for you in
     just a second.

[01:09:14:00]
CMP: Okay.

[01:09:15:00]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston.

[01:09:15:01]
CMP: Okay, Vance, I'm ready to continue. I'm ready.
     Go ahead.

[01:09:15:06]
CC:  Okay, new subject. Like to break in to say that
     request you re-initialize the PTT - [glossary:PTC]. For
     some reason, it's gone up to 18 degrees in pitch
     and yaw both. We don't quite understand this.
     All we can think of is - start it again. Over.

[01:09:15:27]
CMP: Okay. We'll go back.

[01:09:15:33]
_page : 116
_tape : Tape 22/9
CC:  Okay. We are at the - the end of the changes in
     the solo book, and I have two pages of changes
     in the flight plan. Those are pages 3-122 and
     3-125. While you're looking that up, we'll put
     Ken on to answer your question.

[01:09:16:01]
CMP: Okay. I'll start back - let me start back
     re-initializing [glossary:PTC] here.

[01:09:16:07]
CC:  Okay.

[01:09:16:59]
CDR: Okay, Vance, I'm on 3-122 of the flight plan.

[01:09:17:03]
CC:  Okay. Okay, about - at time 156:50 on the right -
     well, on the right-hand half of the page, there's
     a line which states "Visual target 16, south,
     180 plus 1:11, Gassendi, f:15." Request you
     cross out that line.

[01:09:17:38]
CDR: Okay, we'll cross them out.

[01:09:17:42]
CC:  That's all on 3-122. Next change is 3-125.

[01:09:18:07]
CDR: Okay, I'm looking at 125.

[01:09:18:10]
CC:  Okay, starting from the top of the page, cross
     out the first five lines, which are "Set up
     camera for contamination and photography,
     Betelgeuse, CM4/EL/80," et cetera, "MAG T,"
     et cetera, "Install window shades."

[01:09:18:35]
CDR: I've got them crossed.

[01:09:18:37]
CC:  Okay, then jump down to just about 159:28.
     Cross out "Maneuver to contamination field
     photography attitude," and all other lines
     below that through "Enable thrusters A3, C4,
     B3," et cetera.

[01:09:19:06]
CDR: Okay, so we start with "Maneuver to contamination field photography," and we cross out everything down to and including "Enable thrusters A3,
     C4, B3, and D4."

[01:09:19:16]
CC:  That's correct. And those are all of the flight

     is coming on now and later sometime when we get
     [glossary:PTC] squared away, and it's convenient, I suppose
     you should read all these things back to make
     sure that we're squared away on them.

     in the lower - or upper right-hand corner if you
     work your way from east to west and the charts
     are labeled D, E, and F and the solo stuff will
     all be the D and E, and they change with the

     evaluated and - Hey, congratulations. Looks
     real good; they're very happy with it. You're
     down to 4 arc-minutes on the substellar-point
     aspect of it, and that's the first thing to
     mention. The second is, unless you see a need,
     I don't see any need for you to read back the
     information we gave you on the solo book and so
     forth. Do you concur?

     call that your rates were stabilized to start

CC:  Jim, just an item for you and Fred to be thinking
     about in case you haven't been briefed on this,
     something that's now being talked about a little
     bit. These conservative people would like to
     have you read the SHe tank pressure when you go
     into the [glossary:LM] for the [glossary:LM] familiarization at
     58 hours. If there's no midcourse-3, and it
     looks like there's a good chance that there will
     not be, why, they might want to move the [glossary:LM]
     familiarization up from 58 to 55 hours. Over.

[01:11:27:50]
CDR: Okay. If we don't have a midcourse-3, then we'll
     probably move [glossary:LM] FAM up to 55 hours, in which
     case we'll go in there and read SHe tank pressure.

[01:11:28:02]
CC:  Roger. Along with the other FAM stuff, and it's
     not certain that we want to do this, it's just
     being talked about, so this is just the information for you.

[01:11:28:18]
CDR: Okay. This is beginning to sound like the SIM
     that we ran not too long ago.

[01:11:28:29]

     block data if you have it for us.

[01:23:38:32]
CC:  Okay. Got it right here, Jim, and it follows.
     This is the [glossary:P37] pad for lift-off plus 60. The
     reason for the update is for weather avoidance
     in the MPL at 119 hours. It's the same one we
     passed you yesterday, and it's the same weather,
     but we still don't expect a problem at the end
     of the mission. [glossary:GETI] is 060:00, DELTA-V<sub>T</sub> 6079,
     longitude minus 153, [glossary:GET] 400K 118:04. Over.

[01:23:39:18]
CDR: [glossary:GETI] of 060:00, 6079, minus 153, 118:04.

[01:23:39:29]
CC:  Roger. That's correct. I've got a consumables
     update for you, Jim, if you're ready for that.

[01:23:39:41]
CDR: Ready to copy.

[01:23:39:43]
CC:  Okay. As of 47 hours, [glossary:RCS] total 1096, quad Alfa
     270, Bravo 278, Charlie 270, Delta 278, and the
     H<sub>2</sub> - - They gave me the H<sub>2</sub>s in percent, 76 percent; and on the O<sub>2</sub> we have 81 percent. However,
     we show the O<sub>2</sub> tank 2 reading off-scale high now.
     We're quite sure it's a sensor failure. We'd
     like you to verify it with your onboard reading.

[01:23:40:29]
CDR: Okay. Stand by.

[01:23:40:47]
CDR: Joe, we confirm. Our gage reading is - on the
     number 2 O<sub>2</sub> tank is reading off-scale high now,
     but Jack just tells me that it was okay when we
     first looked at it this morning.

[01:23:41:00]
CC:  We verify that. At [time:01:22:45:00|46:45] we had 82 percent and
     apparently when he stirred the, the cryos, the
     sensor broke.

[01:23:41:17]
CDR: Okay.

[01:23:41:19]
_page : 130
_tape : Tape 31/2
CC:  So it's no problem. You're above nominal on all
     your consumables. On the H<sub>2</sub> tank problem, we
     have a procedure that we'd like you to carry out
     which is simply turning the H<sub>2</sub> tank 2 heaters
     to OFF at this time, and we want to see whether
     that won't solve the problem of the tank pressure
     setting off caution and warning. We want to look
     at it that way for a few hours.

[01:23:41:47]
CDR: Okay. You want both H<sub>2</sub> tank 2 heaters to OFF.
     Is that correct?

[01:23:41:51]
CC:  That's negative; just tank 2. We want tank 1
     to stay in AUTO.

[01:23:41:57]
CDR: Okay. Tank 2 heaters off at this time.

[01:23:42:00]
CC:  Okay. Good deal. That's been the high tank
     and apparently while waiting for that pressure
     switch to close, to start the heater cycle, the
     tank 1 pressure has been dropping even a little
     bit lower and just setting off caution and
     warning, so we feel if we turn off the tank 2
     heater and let tank 1 activate the heater cycle,
     we won't get into the caution and warning range.

[01:23:42:25]
CDR: Roger.

[01:23:42:26]
CC:  Okay, Jim. At your convenience we'd like [glossary:P00]
     and ACCEPT. We're ready for - to uplink your state
     vector now since we will not do midcourse 3.
     Over.

[01:23:42:38]
CDR: Roger. You're in [glossary:P00] and ACCEPT, no midcourse 3,
     and we're all set for a state vector update and
     I'm giving you the [glossary:LM]/[glossary:CM] DELTA-P here shortly.

[01:23:42:46]
CC:  Okay. Good deal. And I have flight plan updates
     for you later, at your convenience.

[01:23:43:18]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 13. The [glossary:LM]/[glossary:CM] DELTA-P is
     1.0 psi.

[01:23:43:23]
CC:  Copy, 1.0, Jim.

[01:23:44:37]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 13. I'm about ready for any
     flight plan updates that you have.

[01:23:44:40]
CC:  Okay, 13. To start off with, got a minor procedural change for Jack on his next [glossary:P52], if he's
     ready to listen to that.

[01:23:44:54]
_page : 131
_tape : Tape 31/3
CDR: Okay. Jack's still off COMM. We'll hold off
     on that a little bit and then we'll pick it
     up when he gets on COMM.

[01:23:45:01]
CC:  Okay; fine. I've got two updates for you, Jim.
     One is a procedure for looking for Comet Bennett
     at about [time:02:01:45:00|49:45], and I'll wait till Jack gets up
     before passing you the details on that. The
     other update is concerned with going into the
     [glossary:LM] 3 hours early, and I think Vance mentioned
     to you last night that this was a possibility,
     that we'd like to look at the SHe tank pressure
     early. And since we're not going to do midcourse
     3, we'd like [glossary:LM] entry at 55 hours. Is that
     okay with you?

[01:23:45:41]
CDR: Okay. Right, that's fine with us. We'll move
     up [glossary:LM] entry to 55 hours.

[01:23:45:48]
CC:  Okay. I've got some details on the flight plan
     for you as follows. Of course, since there's
     no [glossary:MCC]-3 you'll be deleting all the midcourse 3
     stuff including the - the [glossary:P52], which is called
     out at about 54-1/2, and we'll be slipping that
     until later, which I'll - which I'll tell -
     which I'll tell - which I'll tell you in a
     minute. Okay. Then you - we want to move the
     battery charge up 3 hours to about [time:02:04:30:00|52:30]. And
     we want to move the - moving the [glossary:LM] tunnel vent
     valve to [glossary:LM]/[glossary:CM] DELTA-P up 3 hours to [time:02:04:45:00|52:45], and
     at that point you can simply go to the 57-hour
     point in the flight plan and change your number
     from 57 hours to 54 hours and start through that.
     In the remarks section at about [time:02:09:50:00|57:50] it says,
     "O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge and waste water dump," here.
     If not performed earlier, we want you to do that
     at 54 hours and 50 minutes. The TV pass then,
     will be at 55 hours to [time:02:07:30:00|55:30]. You'll go right
     through the [glossary:LM] Activation checklist stuff. I'm
     losing you; let's wait a minute.

[01:23:47:41]
CC:  13, Houston. How do you read me?

[01:23:48:05]
CC:  13, Houston. You back with us?

[01:23:49:14]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston. Are you back with us?

[01:23:49:19]
CDR: We're back with you.

[01:23:49:20]
CC:  Okay. I've gone through the battery charge, the
     [glossary:LM] vent valve, the fuel cell purge, and then
     stop [glossary:PTC] at 55 hours, and your roll attitude
     there will be 285 degrees, which is per the
     flight plan. The high gain antenna angles are
     slightly different, pitch 23 and yaw 267 degrees.
     The TV pass till [time:02:07:30:00|55:30], the standard [glossary:LM] activation except for some special steps we'll give
     you to take a look at SHe tank pressure, which
     I don't have yet. Restart [glossary:PTC] at about [time:02:08:30:00|56:30]
     or whenever you're through with the [glossary:LM] activities, and after that, at your convenience,
     we'd like you to - to do the [glossary:P52] option 3 that
     we cancelled at 54-1/2 hours. Over.

[01:23:50:27]
_page : 132
_tape : Tape 31/4
CDR: Okay. That last comment was that we'll do the
     [glossary:P52] after we start [glossary:PTC] at about [time:02:08:30:00|56:30].

[01:23:50:31]
CC:  That's right. Any time after that; it's not
     time critical.

[01:23:50:43]
CDR: Okay. Let's see if I have some of this, Joe.
     Around [time:02:04:30:00|52:30] we're to do the battery charge
     on BAT - battery B.

[01:23:50:52]
CC:  That's correct.

[01:23:50:54]
CDR: And then about [time:02:04:40:00|52:40] we're going to do the [glossary:LM]
     tunnel vent valve, and the [glossary:LM]/[glossary:CM] DELTA-P which
     has been written up at [time:02:07:40:00|55:40].

[01:23:51:04]
CC:  That's correct.

[01:23:51:09]
CDR: We're deleting midcourse-3 and we've moved up
     the [glossary:LM] entry to 55 hours. So we'll merely
     follow all the - We'll follow all the procedures
     that leads up to [glossary:LM] entry that was originally
     scheduled for 58.

[01:23:51:29]
CC:  That's correct. You can start at 57 in the
     flight plan; call it 54 hours and press right
     on.

[01:23:51:48]
CDR: Okay. Then whenever we're finished with the [glossary:LM],
     which we anticipate around [time:02:08:30:00|56:30], we'll commence
     [glossary:PTC] and sometime after that we'll do a [glossary:P52].

[01:23:51:59]
CC:  That's affirmative. And did you copy the new
     high gain angles for 55 hours? The ones we
     had - -

[01:23:52:12]
CDR: Okay. We're going to stop the [glossary:PTC] for [glossary:LM] entry
     at roll 285, and high gain angles are pitch 23
     and yaw 267.

[01:23:52:23]
_page : 133
_tape : Tape 31/5
CC:  That's correct, Jim. And, 13, Houston. The
     computer is yours.

[01:23:52:35]
CDR: The computer is ours. We're in BLOCK, and
     exactly when do you want the TV to be cranked
     up?

[01:23:52:41]
CC:  You can crank it up sometime prior to 55 hours
     at your convenience just to set it up. We'll
     be expecting transmission at 55 hours.

[01:23:52:55]
CDR: Okay.

[01:23:53:46]
CDR: And, Houston, Apollo 13. One thing I missed
     about the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge and waste and water
     dump.

[01:23:53:53]
CC:  Roger. We'd like the the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge
     and waste water dump at [time:02:06:50:00|54:50].

[01:23:54:04]
CDR: Roger. We'll pick up those items at [time:02:06:50:00|54:50].

[01:23:54:30]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston.

[01:23:54:35]
CMP: Go ahead, Joe.

[01:23:54:36]
CC:  All right, Jack. One thing we'd like to have
     done sometime soon is to have you cycle the
     cryo fans in O<sub>2</sub> tank 2 one more time. We'd
     like to see if we can get that sensor back.

[01:23:54:50]
CMP: Okay. O<sub>2</sub> tank 2 fan on now.

[01:23:54:55]
CC:  Roger.

[01:23:56:08]
CDR: Houston, 13.

[01:23:56:09]
CC:  Go, 13.

[01:23:56:14]
CDR: We - We have just one question, the [glossary:LM] tunnel vent
     valve. We're questioning why we're venting
     until the DELTA-V is greater than 1.7 if we
     are going to open up the tunnel, then pressurize
     the [glossary:LM] usually.

[01:23:56:27]
CC:  Right. Stand by on that.

[01:23:56:51]
CC:  13, Houston.

[01:23:56:55]
CDR: Go ahead.

[01:23:56:56]
_page : 134
_tape : Tape 31/6
CC:  Roger. The word on that, Jim, is that they
     want to insure the proper O<sub>2</sub> concentration in
     the [glossary:LM] when you get to the surface, and this
     is a method of doing that by bleeding out
     additional nitrogen.

[01:23:57:12]
CDR: Okay. Thank you.

[01:23:57:21]
CC:  And, 13, Houston. If Jack is up, I'd like to
     talk to him about the [glossary:P52], briefly.

[01:23:57:29]
CDR: Okay. He's here.

[01:23:57:31]
CMP: Go ahead, Joe.

[01:23:57:32]
CC:  Okay, Jack. What they'd like you to do on this
     [glossary:P52] at 49 hours, they've been observing a slight
     jitter in the optics shaft angle of about 0.2 of
     a degree plus or minus. Before you come out of
     the OPTICS ZERO position, at the start of this
     [glossary:P52], they'd like you to just observe the shaft
     readout, and see if the jitter occurs on your
     direct readout there, and also they'd like you
     to briefly call up a [glossary:VERB 16], [glossary:NOUN 91] so we
     can look at the shaft and trunnion angles.

[01:23:58:11]
CMP: Okay. Let's see if I got it right. On the [glossary:P52]
     at 49 hours, before coming out of ZERO on the
     OPTICS, observe the shaft and also call up
     16, 91 and let you look at the shaft and trunnion
     angles to observe a possible jitter. See
     whether it occurs in the ZERO position as well
     as out of ZERO.

[01:23:58:33]
CC:  Roger, Jack. That's correct; and if you have
     time, now, I've got a flight plan update for
     you on looking for the Comet Bennett.

[01:23:58:50]
CMP: Okay. Stand by 1, Joe. And the commander's
     going off the air briefly.

[01:23:58:58]
CC:  Roger that.

[02:00:00:02]
CMP: Okay, Joe. I'm ready to copy the ... now.

[02:00:00:04]
CC:  Okay, Jack. I'm going to read it to you, and
     then add some comments and we'll talk about it
     a little. This should occur sometime after
     [time:02:01:30:00|49:30]. After the [glossary:P52] realine at 49 hours, if
     time permits we would like the crew to investigate while in [glossary:PTC] if there is a roll angle in
     which the comet can be observed for photos. If
     there is, record the optimum roll angle for
     possible photography, prior to reinitiating [glossary:PTC]
     at [time:02:08:30:00|56:30] or so, whenever the guys are done in
     the [glossary:LM], use [glossary:P52] planet option, and the following
     half-unit vectors for tracking Comet Bennett at
     about [time:02:01:46:00|49:46]. Are you ready to copy half-unit
     vectors? Over.

[02:00:01:05]
_page : 135
_tape : Tape 31/7
CMP: Okay. Go ahead, Joe.

[02:00:01:07]
CC:  Okay. R<sub>1</sub> plus 0.34202, R<sub>2</sub> minus 0.07374,
     R<sub>3</sub> plus 0.35719. Read back.

[02:00:01:33]
CMP: Okay. Copy R<sub>1</sub> plus 0.34202, R<sub>2</sub> minus 0.07374,
     R<sub>3</sub> plus 0.35719.

[02:00:01:48]
CC:  Okay. That's correct and the last sentence on
     the update is that you can expect [glossary:AOS] of the
     comet at a roll of 45 degrees and [glossary:LOS] at a roll
     of 155 degrees. Now, the deal here, Jack,
     according to the plots they showed me is, the
     comet appears to be about 10 degrees away from
     the Sun, and due to the geometry of the [glossary:LM] there
     shadowing the Sun, it would appear that you will
     be able to see the comet through the sextant
     without getting Sun shafting between roll angles
     of about 45 degrees and 75 degrees. It appears
     that as your roll gets higher than 75 degrees,
     although the comet is still in the field of view,
     the Sun is also in the field of view, and you
     probably will not have any success between 75
     and 155 if you haven't got it from 45 to 75.
     If you do find that you can see the comet somewhere between 45 and 75 or 80 degrees, just note
     that roll angle and then if it's feasible we'd
     like you to photograph it after the [glossary:LM] entry
     part of the checklist. Over.

[02:00:03:10]
CMP: Okay, Joe. Let me give it back to you and see
     if I've got it here. After the [glossary:P52], during our
     [glossary:PTC] you want us to use [glossary:P52] and observe Bennett's
     Comet through the sextant; note a roll angle if
     we can find it visible. It would be visible
     somewhere between - ideally between 45 and 75
     degrees, and we should lose it about 155 roll,
     and if we do see it, make an observation of
     whether it is photographable, note the roll
     angle for photographs to be taken after or
     prior to initiation of [glossary:PTC] at [time:02:08:30:00|56:30].

[02:00:03:58]
_page : 136

CC:  That's exactly right, Jack.

[02:00:04:04]
CMP: Okay. Real fine.

[02:00:06:24]

[02:01:01:26]
CMP: Okay, Joe. I've started into [glossary:P52] here. I've
     proceeded on option 3, and on the dis - 1520 -
     1525 display, I've called up 1691. I'm going to
     let you observe and see while the - the shaft
     angle while the OPTICS are still in ZERO.

[02:01:01:47]
CC:  Okay. Roger that, Jack. We're looking at it,
     and I'll give you a mark as soon as [glossary:GNC] is happy.

[02:01:01:55]
CMP: Okay. Real fine.

[02:01:02:26]
CC:  13, Houston. Jack, could you give us a readout
     on your counter now?

[02:01:02:35]
CMP: Okay. I'm showing a shaft of 0.2 and a trunnion
     of 359.92.

[02:01:02:48]
CC:  Roger. Copy that. Is there any jumping around
     on the shaft?

[02:01:02:57]
CMP: You mean on the TPAC readout?

[02:01:02:59]
CC:  Yes.

[02:01:03:02]
CMP: As a matter of fact, it went from 0.2 to 0.21.

[02:01:03:08]

[02:01:42:44]
CMP: Okay, Joe. I got into [glossary:P52] about [time:02:01:34:00|49:34]. We loaded
     the planet - or Bennett Comet vectors into the
     planet option, and [glossary:P52] tracked it all the way
     across except that it was always occulted by the
     [glossary:LM], and we're in a roll angle of 155 now.

[02:01:43:09]
CC:  Roger. We're copying your roll angles. At what
     roll angle were you able to start tracking it,
     Jack?

[02:01:43:24]
CMP: Okay. At the time we entered it there, we were
     about 66 degrees roll, so either we started too
     late, or maybe somehow we got a wrong calculation
     on the roll angle.

[02:01:43:40]
CC:  Okay. Let me have [glossary:GNC] comment on that. I suspect that the roll angles we gave you were calculated for exactly 90 degrees pitch, and you're
     probably wobbling enough that they're not exactly
     correct.

[02:01:44:02]
_page : 139
_tape : Tape 32/3
CMP: Yes, I think you - You probably got the right
     idea.

[02:01:45:24]
CC:  13, Houston. Over.

[02:01:45:29]
CMP: Go ahead.

[02:01:45:30]
CC:  Okay, Jack. Notice you've secured from that,
     and that was going to be our recommendation,
     anyway. We're going to have the guys in the
     back room look at it and see if they can come up
     with some - with some better numbers based on
     the cone angle that - that you're traveling
     through, whether there are any roll angles that -
     that are available to you. And if there are,
     and we have time, we might give it another try;
     if not, we just will forget it.

[02:01:46:05]
CMP: Okay.

[02:01:48:17]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston. Over.

[02:01:48:22]
CMP: Go ahead, Joe.

[02:01:48:27]
CC:  Okay, Jack. I'd like to pass you a switch configuration on the CRYO O<sub>2</sub> TANKS and give you
     the reason. Right now, we'd like you to go to
     HEATERS tank 1, OFF; tank 2, AUTO, which is the
     opposite of the way you've got them now. Over.

[02:01:48:48]
CMP: Okay. Is this O<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>?

[02:01:48:51]
CC:  This is O<sub>2</sub>, and stand by for a minute and we'll
     have a - Excuse me. This is H<sub>2</sub>, Jack; it's H<sub>2</sub>.

[02:01:49:22]
CMP: ... is AUTO, ... 2 OFF.

[02:01:49:52]
CMP: Okay, Joe. Do we have you back again?

[02:01:49:55]
CC:  Okay, Jack. We're getting you back, and I hope
     you copied my - my correction of my mistake.
     I'm talking about the H<sub>2</sub> CRYO TANKS. We'd like
     the tank 1 HEATER to OFF; tank 2 to AUTO. Over.

[02:01:50:09]
CMP: Okay. We lost you again. Here's our heater
     configuration now. H<sub>2</sub> HEATERS 1, OFF; 2, AUTO.
     Both O<sub>2</sub> HEATERS are in AUTO.

[02:01:50:23]
_page : 140
_tape : Tape 32/4
CC:  Okay. That's the configuration we want you in,
     and here's what we're thinking about. When we
     went to tank 1 AUTO, tank 2 OFF; we found that
     the heater cycle had a tank 1 pressure of about
     233 psi, which is well above the caution and
     warning limit, and if we go to that configuration
     for sleep, we'll keep from getting CAUTION AND
     WARNING lights during the sleep cycle. Okay.
     In order to do that comfortably, we want to spend
     the rest of the day using more H<sub>2</sub> out of tank
     number 2, so as to get an unbalance in favor of
     tank 1, so at the end of the sleep cycle it'll
     all come out even. And that's why we have you
     in tank 1 OFF, tank 2 AUTO, now. We expect to
     get about a 3-percent unbalance over the next
     10 hours; and prior to sleep, we'll call you to
     reverse the configuration again. Now the only
     disadvantage here is that, during the day, you
     will probably get a few CAUTION AND WARNINGS,
     and we just figured it would be better to get
     them now than while you were sacked out. Over.

[02:01:51:35]
CDR: I'll buy that 100 percent.

[02:01:51:37]
CC:  Okay. Good deal. One other detail
     for you, Jack; [glossary:GNC] tells us that the OPTICS
     jitter is very similar to what we had on
     Apollo 12. It's no problem, but when you're not
     using the OPTICS, we recommend that you turn the
     OPTICS POWER switch to OFF to guard against a
     possible degradation as the flight progresses.
     Over.

[02:01:52:09]
CMP: Okay. Will do.

[02:01:52:23]
CC:  Okay. Apollo 13, Houston. I have one more
     little update for you, and it's another update
     to the erasable memory onboard crew charts on
     page G/9-2. Over.

[02:01:52:48]
CDR: Houston, 13. We're ready to copy.

[02:01:52:51]
CC:  Okay, Jim. These are gyro compensation terms.
     They've already been uplinked, and we're just
     updating your onboard charts now. In column A,
     number 11, change from 77646 to 00114; number 12,
     change from 77332 to 77546; number 13, change

     is 77201. Over.

[02:01:54:01]
CC:  Roger. Readback correct.

[02:01:54:06]
CMP: And, Joe, do you know - Are you going to try and
     let us spot the Bennett Comet on this next revolution there? 
     Or do you want me to turn the OPTICS power off now?

[02:01:54:17]
CC:  Stand by 1, Jack. Okay, Jack. We don't have
     confidence on those roll angles yet, so why don't
     you turn the OPTICS off, and we'll update you
     later.

[02:01:54:32]
CMP: Okay. Going off now.

[02:02:26:54]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[02:02:26:55]
CC:  Roger, Jim. If you've got a couple of minutes
     now, I'd like to read up to you the change to
     the [glossary:LM] entry procedure that we'd like you to
     observe at 55 hours, and the rationale for it.
     Over.

[02:02:27:14]
CDR: Okay, Stand by.

[02:02:27:17]
CC:  Roger.

[02:02:27:23]
CDR: Go ahead, Joe.

[02:02:27:25]
CC:  Okay. Before you start copying, this procedure
     is - is basically simply to activate the supercritical 
     helium pressure gaging so that you can
     read it. And the concern here is lest this
     supercritical helium pressure reach 1800 psi by
     103 hours, at which point we'd be within a possibility of rupturing the burst disk when you
     activate the [glossary:DPS]. Now, based on the pressure at
     launch, and based on a nominal rise time of about
     6-1/2 psi per hour between then and now, the pressure 
     should read about 710 psi. Stand by, 13,
     until we get better COMM.

[02:02:28:43]
CDR: Houston, you were cut out. Would you say again
     about the helium pressure.

[02:02:28:49]
CC:  Roger. Based on the prelaunch pressure in the
     SHe tank and the nominal rise time of about
     6-1/2 psi per hour, the pressure should be about
     710 at 55 hours. Are you reading? Over.

[02:02:29:16]
CC:  Jim, Houston. Did you read that last?

[02:02:30:43]
LMP: Okay, Joe. I 'm on OMNI C now. How do you read?

[02:02:30:47]
CC:  13, Houston. You're loud and clear now. [glossary:INCO]
     tells me he's having a little problem at Goldstone
     and wants me to stand by for a minute.

[02:02:31:02]
LMP: Okay. How do you read now, Joe? I'm going from
     OMNI C to D now.

[02:02:31:06]
_page : 143
_tape : Tape 33/2
CC:  You're still loud and clear on - on D, Fred.
     Stand by 1.

[02:02:31:14]
LMP: Okay. I'll put her back to OMNI B if you all
     want to take command again?

[02:02:31:49]
LMP: And the last thing we heard, Joe, was that the
     SUPERCRIT should be reading about 710 psi.

[02:02:31:56]
CC:  Okay. That's the last thing I passed up. And
     while we're waiting for [glossary:INCO] to decide here, let
     me continue. The deadband that is considered
     acceptable is between 660 and 770 psi. In other
     words, any rise time that'll give you one - a
     pressure between those two, will keep you below
     the critical pressure at 103 hours or so. So,
     we expect it to read in that - in that band and
     if it does, there will be no problem. If it
     reads between 770 and 800 psi, we will want you
     to check the pressure again at about 59 hours,
     and I'll get the detailed procedures in a minute.
     If the pressure is equal to or greater than
     800 psi, we're going to have to go into some more
     detailed procedures; we're going to try to - to
     get PCM data on it, for one thing. We may have
     to have you sit there and stare at the gage for
     a while to find out when it clicks up and get an
     accurate rise time on it, and then in extreme
     case, we are even thinking about a [glossary:DPS] burn, but
     we don't really think that will happen. Now, if
     you are ready to copy, what I have for you is a
     change or an addition to the [glossary:LM] Activation checklist 
     between pages [glossary:TLC]-1 and [glossary:TLC]-2, which consists
     of seven steps, and if you can find a blank side
     to write it down on, I would like to pass it up.
     Over.

[02:02:33:44]
LMP: Okay. How do you read on OMNI C, now?

[02:02:33:48]
CC:  Okay. You're loud and clear on OMNI C. Stand by
     1 while we get [glossary:INCO] synced up.

[02:02:34:00]
LMP: Okay. The rest of your update was that it's okay
     if it is anywhere between 660 and 770 psi. If
     it's above 770, you are going to ask us to consider going back in at 59 hours and either get
     PCM going or sit there and give you gage reading
     changes on the basis of that. And you said something 
     about an extreme measure. We may have to
     consider some sort of [glossary:DPS] maneuver.

[02:02:34:45]
_page : 144
_tape : Tape 33/3
CC:  That's correct, Fred. We don't have procedures
     for that yet, and we don't have any real expectation of getting into it. The procedure I'd like
     to read up to you now is simply the steps required
     to get the supercritical helium pressure reading
     at 55 hours. Over.

[02:02:35:10]
LMP: Okay.

[02:02:35:12]
CC:  Okay. We're calling this [glossary:TLC]-1A, step 6,
     "Transfer to [glossary:LM] power."

[02:02:35:23]
LMP: All right. Stand by 1, Joe.

[02:02:35:25]
CC:  Okay.

[02:02:35:37]
CMP: Okay, Joe. He's ready to copy.

[02:02:35:40]
CC:  Okay. Step 6, "Transfer to [glossary:LM] power (floodlights
     blank), CAUTION WARNING POWER CAUTION light ON.
     Report [glossary:GET] to [glossary:MCC]. Panel 11, CIRCUIT BREAKER [glossary:EPS]
     TRAESLUNAR BUS TIE, CLOSED. Circuit breaker
     panel 16, [glossary:EPS] TRANSLUNAR BUS TIE, CLOSED. Circuit
     breaker panel 11, LIGHTING UTILITY, CLOSED.
     And activate utility lights." Over. And, 13,
     Houston. Select OMNI Bravo, please.

[02:02:37:08]
LMP: Okay, Joe. I've created a new page here called
     [glossary:TLC]-1A, item 6, Transfer to [glossary:LM] power and the usual
     check that the floodlight's blank and that I've
     got the CAUTION WARNING POWER light ON; I get a
     [glossary:GET] from Jack, and I will pass that on down to
     you. Item 7, CIRCUIT BREAKER [glossary:EPS] TRANSLUNAR BUS
     TIE, panels 11 and 16, CLOSED. Step 8, circuit
     breaker lighting and utility on panel 1, CLOSED,
     and turn on the utility lights. However, the
     lighting is such that I don't really need those.
     They are in stowage, right now, I guess, in the
     [glossary:ISA], and I'll probably just leave them there.

[02:02:37:48]
CC:  Okay. That's optional. The way we had page
     [glossary:TLC]-1A written, that was all part of step 6.
     You haven't even gotten to step 7 yet. Step 7
     is as follows.

[02:02:38:11]
CC:  Fred, Houston. Are you with me?

[02:02:38:41]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston. Are you reading me now?

[02:02:40:20]
LMP: Okay. Houston, 13. How do you read?

[02:02:40:22]
_page : 145
_tape : Tape 33/4
CC:  13, Houston. Loud and clear. What OMNI you on
     now?

[02:02:40:28]
LMP: I'm going to stay OMNI B, if you all want to take
     command back and you can let [glossary:INCO] jockey them
     around between B and D. And how many steps we
     got, so I know whether to write big or small here,
     Joe?

[02:02:40:41]
CC:  Okay. We got steps 6 through 12, but step 7 is
     the same size as 6, and 8 through 12 are short.
     They're only one line each.

[02:02:40:53]
LMP: Okay.

[02:02:40:54]
CC:  Okay. Step 7 follows: "Circuit breaker panel 11,
     AC BUS B, HELIUM PQGS PROPELLANT DISPLAY, CLOSED.

[02:02:41:44]
LMP: Hold on a minute, Joe.

[02:02:41:45]
CC:  Okay.

[02:02:41:49]
LMP: My shorthand is rather poor today.

[02:02:42:13]
LMP: Okay I'm now up to circuit breaker panel 11,
     INVERTER 1, CLOSED.

[02:02:42:20]
CC:  Okay. Next was "Circuit breaker panel 16,
     INSTRUMENTATION SIG SENSOR, CLOSED. Then INVERTER 1, 
     SELECT. Then HELIUM MONITOR to SUPERCRIT PRESS. 
     Report SUPERCRIT PRESS to [glossary:MCC]." Over.

LMP: Houston, 13. How do you read?

[02:02:44:34]
CC:  13, Houston. You're coming through. We still
     have some background noise. Do you want to read
     back step 7?

[02:02:44:53]
LMP: Hello, Houston; 13.

[02:02:44:55]
CC:  13, Houston. Go ahead.

[02:02:45:00]
LMP: Okay, Joe. The last thing I got was HELIUM
     MONITOR to SUPERCRIT PRESSURE.

[02:02:45:07]
_page : 146
_tape : Tape 33/5
CC:  Okay. The last part of step 7 is, "Report
     SUPERCRIT PRESSURE to [glossary:MCC]," and read back step 7.

[02:02:45:30]
LMP: Okay. Step 7. Circuit breaker panel 11,
     AC BUS B, HELIUM PQGS DISPLAY, CLOSED. Main -
     Circuit breaker panel 11, AC BUS B, NUMERIC LIGHTING, 
     CLOSED. CD panel 11, AC BUS - Is that AC
     BUS B? BUS TIE INVERTER 1, CLOSED?

[02:02:45:51]
CC:  That's affirmative.

[02:02:45:53]
LMP: And CB - CB [glossary:EPS] INVERTER 1, panel 11, CLOSED.
     CB panel 16, INSTRUMENT SIGNAL SENSOR, CLOSED.
     INVERTER 1, SELECT. HELIUM MONITOR to SUPERCRIT
     PRESSURE. Report pressure to [glossary:MSFN].

[02:02:46:09]
CC:  Okay. That's correct. Now step 8 is, "On [glossary:MCC]
     request, perform step 9." In other words, you
     wait for us to decide what to do and that's
     according to the gouge we've already given you.
     And step 9, I'll give you now, is "HELIUM MONITOR
     to OFF, INVERTER to OFF." Over.

[02:02:46:45]
LMP: Okay. Step 8 says, "Set in an [glossary:MCC] hold." Step 9
     says, "On [glossary:MCC]' s words, HELIUM MONITOR OFF, INVERTER OFF."

[02:02:47:00]
CC:  Roger. That's correct. Step 10 is, "Configure
     circuit breaker panels per Activation 3 and 4."

[02:02:47:24]
LMP: Okay. Configure - step 10, "Configure circuit
     breakers per Activation pages 3 and 4."

[02:02:47:31]
CC:  Roger. That's correct. Step 11 is, "Deactivate
     the utility lights if you activated them," and
     step 12 which is the last one is, "Transfer to
     [glossary:CSM] power, usual observations, and report time to [glossary:MCC]."

[02:02:48:20]
LMP: Okay. Step 11, "Deactivate utility lights."
     12, "Transfer to [glossary:CSM] power and note the usual
     observations and report the [glossary:GET]."

[02:02:48:31]
CC:  Okay. That's it. And, of course, Houston will
     be requesting you to go to step 9 if the pressure
     is less than 770. If the pressure is between
     770 and 800, we will be asking you to do the
     following, if you're ready to copy.

[02:02:48:59]
LMP: Stand by. I've got to find some more blank paper.

[02:02:49:01]
_page : 147
_tape : Tape 33/6
CC:  Yes. This is going to be page [glossary:TLC]-3, but it's
     very short.

[02:02:49:25]
LMP: Okay. Go ahead with [glossary:TLC]-3.

[02:02:49:31]
CC: Okay. Stand by 10 seconds, Fred.

[02:02:50:20]
CC:  Fred, Houston.

[02:02:50:25]
LMP: All right. Go ahead.

[02:02:50:26]
CC:  Roger. We'll hold off on that. It was a short
     three-step procedure which said, "Repeat activation pages 
     1, 1A, and 2," but there was another
     step in it that nobody understands. So, essentially what 
     we'd recommend in that case would be
     that you would repeat the procedure that we just
     passed up for reading the SUPERCRIT pressure. If
     we need to, we'll clarify it later on. And that's
     all we've got.

[02:02:50:56]
LMP: Okay.

[02:02:57:38]
CDR: Houston, 13.

[02:02:57:44]
CC:  13, Houston. Go ahead.

[02:02:57:49]
CDR: Okay. One thing, Joe; I just want to doublecheck
     again. All the stuff that normally was going to
     start at 57 hours, which the first item was pressurize [glossary:CSM] to 5.7 psia, we're going to move that
     up to 64 now, so we have our [glossary:LM] entry which was
     nominally at 58 at 55. Is that correct?

[02:02:58:10]
CC:  That's correct, Jim.

[02:02:58:12]

[02:03:07:08]
CC:  Roger, 13. Because of the O<sub>2</sub> tank 2 quantity
     sensor drop out, [glossary:EECOM] wants to keep a little
     closer track of the cryo quantities, and he's
     going to be asking you to stir all the cryo tanks
     at slightly more frequent intervals than had been
     planned, and the first time is now, and we will
     be calling you probably every 5 or 6 hours, except 
     during sleep period and high activity periods.

[02:04:45:43]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[02:04:46:41]
CDR: Okay. Read you good now. Seems like we've had
     a little trouble with the COMM today.

[02:04:46:46]
CC: Yes. I guess it's partly because you are further
     out. We just wanted to tell you that you were going to get that
     CAUTION WARNING that you just got.

[02:04:46:58]
CDR: Right. We just got.

[02:04:47:00]
CC:  And I won't bother you with those calls anymore,
     unless you especially want them.

[02:04:47:10]
CDR: That's okay, Vance. You don't have to call us
     about that, unless it's something serious.

[02:04:47:14]

CC:  13, Houston. Go ahead.

[02:05:19:45]
CDR: Right, we're not doing anything right now, Vance,
     we're just getting curious, we could start the
     [glossary:LM] entry procedures, and get everything squared
     away, and then when the TV comes up at 55 hours,
     we can just use it for the TV, and we wouldn't
     be worrying about checking out the SHe tank
     pressures and everything like that.

[02:05:20:07]
CC:  Okay, let us mull that one a minute here, and
     I'll get right back with you.

[02:05:20:14]
CDR: Okay.

[02:05:23:35]
CDR: Also, Houston, Apollo 13. We'd like to move up
     the waste water dump and maybe the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell
     purge a little bit early, if we could.

[02:05:23:51]

[02:05:26:37]
CC:  Jim, you're clear to go on into the [glossary:LM], and just
     advise though that the TV time is still fixed
     at 55 hours, and - so we'll be standing by to
     support your entry and we'll get back with you
     on a minute - in a minute on the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell
     purge and the waste water dump.

[02:05:26:59]
CDR: Okay. Sounds good.

[02:05:27:02]
CC:  And also request your [glossary:LM]/[glossary:CM] DELTA-P which was on
     the flight plan for 53 hours. What did you vent it down to? Over.

[02:05:27:16]
CDR: We have 1.7 now. We vented it down to that figure.

[02:05:27:20]
CC:  Okay, you vented down to 1.7, and what did it
     start at?

[02:05:27:28]

CDR: We'd like another confirmation, when we closed
     the tunnel vent valve back to [glossary:LM]/[glossary:CM] DELTA-P, we
     were reading about 1.7 - 1.75, and it slowly
     went up now to about - oh, I'd say a little less
     than 2.2. Seems to be holding there - Is there
     a lag in the gaging system?

[02:05:42:32]

     in pressure is normal, because it was just tracking an increase 
     in cabin pressure.

     there's no need to stop it until 55 [glossary:GET] when TV starts.

[02:06:49:29]
CC:  Fred, Houston is reading you loud and clear.

[02:06:49:34]
LMP: Okay. I've got up through step 7 now, and I'm
     not getting much of a light in the helium indicator here. 
     Why don't I review for you how we've proceeded, and you look at the procedure
     you gave me, and see if we've missed anything.

[02:06:49:53]
CC:  Roger. Go ahead.

[02:06:49:57]
LMP: Okay. We transferred to [glossary:LM] power and that looked
     okay. I'm staring at a CAUTION AND WARNING POWER
     light, and all the red flags; and we got both X
     LUNAR BUS TIE breakers IN. The UTILITY LIGHTING
     breaker is IN; then AC BUS B HELIUM PQS DISPLAY;
     the AC BUS B NUMERIC LIGHTING, and AC BUS B
     INVERTER 1 is - BUS TIE is CLOSED. Then I closed
     the INVERTER 1 breaker, and I've selected, on
     panel 16, and the SIGNAL CONSENSOR [sic] breaker
     is in; I've selected INVERTER 1 and put the
     HELIUM MONITOR switch to SUPERCRIT and I have
     no lights.

[02:06:51:06]
CC:  Okay, Fred, let us take a look at it.

[02:06:51:07]

     which looks like a pretty good - pretty good number.

[02:06:51:47]
CC:  Roger. We copy 720. Thank you, Fred - -

[02:06:51:49]

CC:  Roger. 710 to 720.

[02:06:52:16]
CC:  Okay, Fred. Those are good numbers, and we're
     not going to have to crank up the TM. That's
     the number we were looking for.

[02:06:52:26]
LMP: Very good. Okay. Do you want me to back out
     of this in reverse at least as far as getting
     this part of it powered down?

[02:07:01:40]
CC:  As you were on that, Jim. We don't have you on
     high gain yet. We're still looking at you.

[02:07:02:27]
CC:  13, Houston. In this attitude, we'd suggest
     pitch 5, yaw 237 on the high gain. Over.

[02:07:02:39]
CDR: Pitch 5, yaw 237. Roger.

[02:07:05:12]
CMP: Okay, Jack. Can you - can you read the high gain
     now?

[02:07:05:24]
CC:  Affirmative, Jack. We've got you on a high gain
     and it appears to us that we're in wide beam - wide beam width.

[02:07:05:32]
CMP: Yes. We can't get it to come down to narrow.
     We tried to switch to AUTO track or REACQ, and
     it - yaw drives around from 270 to 0. And pitch
     goes from about 6 degrees around to 90. I'm
     trying - we're fitting it manual now at the
     angles that you gave us, and I'll try and get
     you in medium and narrow beam widths picking it
     up manually here.

[02:07:06:06]
CC:  Roger, Jack. Meanwhile, we'll look at the
     situation you describe there.

[02:07:06:13]
CMP: Okay. And it does it on both sets of servo
     electronic power.

[02:07:07:15]
CMP: Jack, what it looks like is that, when we hit
     239 degrees at this attitude, it hit some sort
     of scan limit or something and drops off.

[02:07:07:33]
CC:  Roger, Jack; thank you.

[02:07:07:37]
CMP: Okay, I'm trying you in wide or medium beam width
     now.

[02:07:07:54]
CMP: Can you pick up the TV in this condition here
     at all?

[02:07:08:07]
CC:  Negative, Jack. We'll have to have the narrow
     beam width.

[02:07:08:14]
CMP: Okay. Can you give us, maybe, a slight maneuver?

[02:07:09:09]
_page : 158

CC: Okay, 13. We've got Fred-o on TV.

[02:07:15:04]
CDR: Roger, Houston. What we plan to do for you
     today is start out in the space shipper [sic]
     Odyssey, and take you on through from Odyssey
     in through the tunnel into Aquarius. And show
     you a little bit of the landing vehicle, and
     your TV operator is now resting on the center
     couch, looking at Fred Haise, whose head is now
     just about at the beginning of the tunnel, and
     his back is against the lower-equipment-bay
     optical area. And Fred will now transport himself into the tunnel, and into the spaceship
     Aquarius.

[02:07:15:48]
_page : 159
_tape : Tape 36/5
LMP: You know one thing I noted, Jack, when I first
     came across here, that starting upright in the
     command module and heading down in Aquarius,
     there's a little bit of an orientation change
     that, even though I'd been through it once in
     the water tank, it still pretty unusual. I
     find myself, now, standing with my head on the
     floor when I get down inside the [glossary:LM].

[02:07:16:25]
CC:  That's a great picture, Jim. You got the light
     just right.

[02:07:16:40]
LMP: And one of the nice things, Jack, particularly
     for a novice like myself, is the - the ease of
     moving around in here. It's, of course, as you
     know from working in the command module simulator,
     it's really quite a boon to have zero gravity
     as an aid. Because you get - pretty confining,
     really, at one g, to move around very much in
     there, and it's quite easy in this environment.
     The [glossary:LM], as you can see, it looked pretty clean,
     I found a couple of loose washers about it and
     the - a little plastic cap off the sequence
     camera had come loose and I found it lodged over
     by the ED panel. Okay. Right under Jim, now,
     he's actually standing on a - what looks to be
     a can here. And, for the sake of all the people
     back there, housed inside this can is the - the
     [glossary:LM] ascent engine where, hopefully, you can see
     my hand resting on top of right now - the engine
     that we use to get off of the Moon. Immediately
     adjacent to the engine cover here, I have my
     hand on a white box now, which has been shown
     before. This happens to be Jim's [glossary:PLSS], or the
     backpack which'll supply oxygen and water for
     cooling while on the lunar surface. This device
     we hope to make use of for - a planned 4 hours and
     possibly up to as much as 5 hours. Right - right
     behind the [glossary:PLSS], a couple of little square packages I now have my hand on here, one here and
     one right below, are our [glossary:OPS]s, which are, in
     essence, the emergency oxygen supplies, which
     are good for some 40 to 45 minutes. These are 
     when we get ready to mount up and head outside,
     will be placed up on top of the [glossary:PLSS].

[02:07:19:24]
LMP: The second backpack is mounted down on the [glossary:LM]
     floor, I hope, positioned right between the two
     of us. I have my hand on it at this time.

[02:07:19:41]
_page : 160
_tape : Tape 36/6
CC:  Roger, Fred. We see it. The picture's coming
     through real good, and your description is good.
     We see Jim's got the camera oriented the way we
     like to look at it. So, keep talking.

[02:07:20:05]
LMP: Okay. I guess everybody has pretty much
     envisioned the space program as being all a lot
     of exotic electronics, and, certainly, a lot of
     it is. But I thought I'd bring out a couple of
     items here in conjunction with the [glossary:PLSS]. After
     the first [glossary:EVA], you get a very accurate measurement of the amount of water that's left in the
     [glossary:PLSS]s. We're going to make use of this bag I'm
     showing now to collect the remaining water out
     of the [glossary:PLSS] and see just how much we really did
     have left, and hopefully, on future missions, to
     be able to extend safely the allowable time on
     these units even a little further. And, my
     other hand, I have the mechanism by which we
     determine just how much water we really have in
     this bag. And I guess this - an apt description
     for this device would be a fish scale. And you
     can see I'm weighing myself right now, and it
     says I weigh actually less than zero right now.
     Guess its calibration isn't too good.

[02:07:21:22]
CC:  That'll be the day.

[02:07:21:29]
LMP: I think even you'd weigh zero here, Jack.

[02:07:21:38]
CC:  Touché.

[02:07:22:14]
CDR: Houston, this is Jim. Since Fred's been in the
     lunar module, and since he's the lunar module
     pilot, this is the first time that he's felt
     that he's been right-side up.

[02:07:22:34]
CC:  Roger, Jim.

[02:07:22:37]
CDR: I might tell you that we're looking at right
     now, that round bag that's just behind Fred holds
     our vacuum hose; and when we get back inside the
     [glossary:LM] we'll hook the vacuum off our suits, and it's
     resting or it's attached to the hatch which
     will - we will open to go on to the lunar surface, and, of course, to come back in. The
     hatch which we have come to now is a round hatch,
     which is our docking hatch between the - between
     Odyssey and Aquarius.

[02:07:23:11]
_page : 161
_tape : 
CC:  Roger, and we see Fred looking in the vacuum
     cleaner there now.

[02:07:23:22]
LMP: Okay, what I have out now, Jack, is LEVVA, which
     has also been shown before. It's a head garment
     for wearing out on the surface, and I - I'm
     bringing Jim's out here to show a couple of MODs.
     One problem before is that the cast of characters
     down on the surface haven't been able to be distinguished apart very well. So, not only Jim's
     suit has some red stripes on it, but as you can
     see his LEVVA also has a - a red stripe. And
     now you can see one other MOD here too, Jack,
     which I hadn't really seen myself before. I
     guess on 12, Pete and A1 had commented about
     the - commented about having trouble with sunlight in the eyes, so on our LEVVAs they put on
     a new center section which you can pull down
     and use sort of like a baseball cap.

[02:07:24:56]
CDR: Okay, Jack. Who fixed up our LEVVAs?

[02:07:25:12]
LMP: How's the detail on this one, Jack?

[02:07:25:15]
CC:  Say again, Fred.

[02:07:25:19]
LMP: Can you see any detail in this picture now, or
     am I blocking out too much of the sunlight?

[02:07:25:26]
CC:  That's affirmative. We've got a good picture
     of the LEVVA there, and it's coming through loud
     and clear.

[02:07:25:35]
LMP: Okay.

[02:07:25:54]
CDR: Okay, Jack, while Fred is putting away my helmet,
     you are looking over into Fred's station now.
     How's this picture, is it okay before - or do I
     have to adjust it?

[02:07:26:06]
CC:  We have a hunch that the setting might be in
     PEAK but we recommend AVERAGE on the ALC if you
     haven't got it there already.

[02:07:26:16]
CDR: We're in AVERAGE, Jack.

[02:07:26:18]
CC:  Okay. And we're getting a good picture of the
     LMP side with the [glossary:DEDA] over there.

[02:07:26:29]
_page : 162
CMP: Hey, Jack, one question on the command module
     here. Do I - I have the [glossary:DAP] right now wide deadband. 
     Do you want me to begin setting up narrow
     deadband and nulling the rates to start [glossary:PTC] again?

[02:07:26:47]
CC:  Stand by, Jack.

[02:07:27:31]
LMP: What I'm fishing out now, Jack, is another new
     piece of hardware that we are taking along this
     time as a result of some comments made on the Apollo 12 flight.

[02:07:27:52]
CDR: What Fred is opening up - is a drink bag
     that we place inside of our neckring that will
     allow us to drink while we are on the lunar surface. 
     They - Pete and Al - did not have that on
     Apollo 12 and they, consequently, got very
     thirsty. But we hope to alleviate that situation
     by having our own little bag of water which, with
     very little effort, we can have a sip or two
     while we are looking around and doing our geology work.

[02:07:28:33]
LMP: So if you hear any funny noises, it is just
     probably the drink bag.

[02:07:28:50]
CDR: Fred, the bag's empty.

[02:07:29:16]
CDR: Fred is now looking through our optical device.
     It's an instrument in which to aline our platform, 
     and Fred is now looking into it just to
     see what kind of an outside picture he might
     be able to get. We might be able to use a TV
     camera to look through our optical instrument
     to the outside of the command module. A few
     minutes ago while we first came in, we did
     manage to look to the outside of the side hatch
     of the command module through our optical instrument. 
     Stand by. We'll try to see what we can do here.

[02:07:29:49]
CC:  Roger, Jim. Break, Jack, we'd like you to
     stay in the deadband you are now in, and we'll
     make a change when the TV is over. Another
     thing we would like you to do is check your
     pitch and yaw on your high gain meter so we can
     compare it with what we're seeing down here.

[02:07:30:11]
CMP: Okay, it's showing about - say 28 degrees and 267.

[02:07:30:18]
_page : 163
_tape : Tape 36/9
CC:  20 and 267.

[02:07:30:21]
CMP: 28 - 28 and 267.

[02:07:30:45]
LMP: Okay, Jack, have you got that picture now?

[02:07:30:49]
CC:  Fred, about one-quarter of our screen is lighted
     and it's impossible to determine what you are
     looking at right now. Maybe you could give us a
     little verbal description.

[02:07:31:02]
LMP: Okay. It's looking through the [glossary:AOT] in position 4,
     right rear. And we're looking back toward the -
     over the side hatch at the aft side of the service module.

[02:07:31:28]
LMP: Okay. Is - is it too dark a picture, Jack? You
     think the f-stop open may help?

[02:07:31:34]
CC:  No, Fred, it's got to be centered up a little
     bit. That's primarily what you have to do.

[02:07:31:43]
CDR: Jack, we can't center it up any more, because
     the side hatch is only one part of the [glossary:AOT]. The
     rest of that blackness you see is really space.

[02:07:32:11]
_comment : "D-10 corrected to detent from original transcript"
LMP: Okay. We'll try another one, and it's a little
     better centered. In fact, the only other one we
     have that shows the whole picture. We're in the
     forward detent of the [glossary:AOT] now, position 2, and you
     should be seeing something familiar like a radar
     antenna.

[02:07:32:41]
CC:  Okay, we see you moving the camera up to the [glossary:AOT]
     lens, and we got a real good picture now.

[02:07:33:03]
CDR: And -

[02:07:33:23]
LMP: Okay, Jack, I'm looking out the right window now,
     and not too far off in the distance now, you can
     see the objective, and I'll zoom in on it here a
     little and see if it brings it in better.

[02:07:33:57]
LMP: And it's actually beginning to look a little
     bigger now. You can see quite distinctly some
     of the features with the naked eye. And so far,
     I guess I have to even agree with Jim that it's
     still looking pretty gray with white spots.

[02:07:34:39]
CC:  Okay, Fred. We're getting a good picture of your
     destination there.

[02:07:35:04]
_page : 164
_tape : Tape 36/10
CDR: Jack, you've been looking at the - at Fred's
     workshop now, and you can see the abort guidance
     computer. And over there on the - tucked away in
     his armrest, is our activation checklist, which
     we'll be using very shortly. Up on the top of
     the window, we have our camera already mounted
     ready for photographing the descent. And now
     Fred's engaged in his favorite pastime, I found
     out on this flight so far.

[02:07:35:47]
CC:  He's not in the food locker, is he?

[02:07:35:52]
CDR: That's his second favorite pastime. He's rigging
     his hammock for sleep on the lunar surface now
     to find out - to see what it's going to be like.

[02:07:36:03]
CC:  Roger. Sleeping and then eating.

[02:07:36:29]
LMP: It's kind of difficult here, Jack, getting into
     a hammock in zero g. I'm not sure if I keep
     floating away from it or it keeps moving away from me.

[02:07:36:50]
CDR: If you notice a few things floating around, we
     found just about one or two washers occasionally.

[02:07:36:57]
LMP: And for the benefit of those that may wonder
     where Jim sleeps. Be a little difficult to rig
     his hammock in here right now with the hatch open,
     but his runs laterally in this direction, fore
     aft. So he has the upper berth and I get the
     lower berth.

[02:07:37:34]
CDR: And now while Fred's taking his hammock down and
     restowing it, I might give you some idea of what
     sort of confusion of attitudes since there is no
     up or down, and I'm situated on top of the ascent
     engine just at the entrance to the tunnel. I'll
     reverse the camera 180 degrees and go from Fred,
     look through the tunnel again back at Odyssey,
     and we might pick up part of Jack.

[02:07:38:25]
CC:  There he is. We see him.

[02:07:38:56]
CDR: Okay, Houston. For the benefit of the television
     viewers, we've just about completed our little
     inspection of Aquarius, and now we're proceeding
     through the hatchy-gap into the tunnel and going
     back toward the Odyssey.

[02:07:39:22]
CC:  Okay, Jim. It's been a great show so far.

[02:07:40:20]
_page : 165
_tape : Tape 36/11
CDR: And finally, Jack's let me back into the Odyssey as we
     slide on through the tunnel here

[02:07:41:14]
CDR: Houston, 13. Are you still on TV?

[02:07:41:17]
CC:  Yes, we sure are. We've got a good picture of
     the skipper there.

[02:07:41:22]
CDR: Okay. What we can show you now, a little added
     benefit, we've got the drogue on Fred's couch
     in the command module right now. We stowed it
     temporarily while we're checking out the - out
     Aquarius and underneath his couch, we've got the
     probes stowed. Quite a big cumbersome device,
     and we'll get a shot of it for you.

[02:07:42:13]
CDR: You're looking now at our probe, the place on
     the nose of Odyssey. It's a very heavy thing
     but I suppose in zero gravity it weighs nothing,
     and it's much easier to move around. As a matter
     of fact, both Fred and Jack commented, as many
     people in the past have, of how much bigger the
     spacecraft appears in actual flight when you have
     such ease in moving compared to our simulator
     which make training rather difficult.

[02:07:42:58]
CC:  Okay. We're seeing a good picture of the probe
     there, Jim, and looks like the characters shaved
     before the show this time.

[02:07:43:10]
CDR: Well, Fred said he had to keep up his TV image.

[02:07:43:17]
LMP: Yes. That may be my first and last time though,
     Jack.

[02:07:43:21]
CDR: It took Fred 1 hour to shave.

[02:07:43:37]
CDR: We might give you a quick - a quick shot of our
     entertainment on board the spacecraft, which
     has been keeping us company for some time.

[02:07:43:57]
_type : music
SC:  (Music - Willow Weep For Me)

[02:07:44:15]
CDR: This little tape recorder has been a big
     benefit - has been a big benefit to us in passing some of our time away on our transit to the
     Moon, and it's rather odd to see it floating like
     this in Odyssey while it's playing the theme from
     "2001." And, of course, the tapes wouldn't be
     complete without "Aquarius."

[02:07:45:08]
_page : 166
_tape : Tape 36/12
CC:  Okay, Jim. We're seeing the tape recorder now,
     and just - by the way, how long do you expect to
     keep the TV on this evening?

[02:07:45:18]
CDR: Well, when we - Stand by 1.

[02:07:45:25]
LMP: Yes, I got them with the cabin repress valve
     again there, Jack.

[02:07:45:29]
CDR: Every time he does that our hearts - our hearts
     jump in our mouth. And, Jack, any time you want
     to terminate TV, we're all set to go.

[02:07:46:01]
CC:  Okay, Jim. It's been a real good TV show. We
     think we ought to conclude it from here now.
     What do you think?

[02:07:46:11]
CDR: Roger. Sounds good. And this is the crew of
     Apollo 13 wishing everybody there a nice evening,
     and we're just about ready to close out our inspection 
     of Aquarius and get back for a pleasant
     evening in Odyssey. Good night.

[02:07:46:30]
CC:  Thank you, 13.

[02:07:48:40]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston. The next thing we'd like you
     to do is to -

[02:07:48:45]
CMP: Go ahead.

[02:07:48:46]
CC:  - - we'd like you to roll right to 060 and null
     your rates for photography of the Comet Bennett.
     To do that, we would like you to enable quads C
     and D. For the maneuver, use all your quads.
     And in precisely 1 minute, we'd like you to terminate the battery charge on battery B. One
     other request, we'd like to have you verify - -

[02:07:49:12]
CMP: Okay. Will do.

[02:07:49:14]
CC:  One other request, we'd like you to verify your
     high gain configuration. We'd like to know what
     track mode, what SERVO, and what beam width.

[02:07:49:25]
CMP: Okay, Jack, during the TV, we were AUTO TRACK,
     NARROW BEAM WIDTH, and the PRIMARY ELECTRONICS.
     And we had a good lockup. Just after we started
     the maneuver, I was able to lock you up and get
     real good signal strength, and it just seemed
     that right there at about 239 degrees in yaw,
     that the signal strength would just drop off and
     yaw would go to zero and pitch would go to 90.

[02:07:50:05]
_page : 167
_tape : Tape 36/13
CC:  Roger. We copy, and the TV show was great.

[02:07:50:12]
CMP: Okay, real fine. Okay, I'm going to maneuver
     to 060, 090, and 0.

[02:07:50:31]
CC: And, 13, we'd like you to check C-4 thruster.

[02:07:51:33]
CMP: Okay, Jack. The battery charge has been terminated 
     on the battery B.

[02:07:51:38]
CC:  Roger. We see it, Jack. And we got a reading
     of minus 2 degrees on the docking index. We'd
     like to know it that's 2.0 precise or if it's 2.1 or 1.9.

[02:07:51:54]
CMP: No. It's a minus 2.0 precisely.

[02:07:51:56]
CC: Thank you.

[02:07:52:58]
CC: 13, we've got one more item for you, when you
     get a chance. We'd like you to stir up your
     cryo tanks. In addition, I have shaft and trunnion - -

[02:07:53:07]
CC:  - - for looking at the Comet Bennett, if you
     need it.

[02:07:53:12]
CMP: Okay. Stand by.

[02:07:55:19]
LMP: Okay, Houston - -

[02:07:55:20]
CMP: I believe we've had a problem here.

[02:07:55:28]
CC:  This is Houston. Say again, please.

[02:07:55:35]
_labels : {"Key line": null}
CDR: Houston, we've had a problem. We've had a MAIN B BUS UNDERVOLT.

[02:07:55:42]
CC:  Roger. MAIN B UNDERVOLT.

[02:07:55:58]
CC:  Okay, stand by, 13. We're looking at it.

[02:07:56:10]
LMP: Okay. Right now, Houston, the voltage is - is
     looking good. And we had a pretty large bang
     associated with the CAUTION AND WARNING there.
     And as I recall, MAIN B was the one that had had
     an amp spike on it once before.

[02:07:56:40]
CC:  Roger, Fred.

[02:07:56:54]
_page : 168
_tape : Tape 36/14
LMP: In the interim here, we're starting to go ahead
     and button up the tunnel again.

[02:07:57:01]
CC:  Roger.

[02:07:57:04]
LMP: Yes. That jolt must have rocked the sensor on -
     see now - O<sub>2</sub> QUANTITY 2. It - was oscillating
     down around 20 to 60 percent. Now it's fullscale high again.

[02:07:57:22]
CC:  Roger.

[02:07:57:30]
CDR: And, Houston, we had a RESTART on our computer
     and we had a [glossary:PGNCS] light and the RESTART RESET.

[02:07:57:37]
CC:  Roger. RESTART and a [glossary:PGNCS] light. RESET on a
     [glossary:PGNCS], RESET - -

[02:07:57:44]
CDR: Okay. And we're looking at our S - SERVICE
     MODULE [glossary:RCS] HELIUM 1. We have - B is barber poled
     and D is barber poled, HELIUM 2, D is barber
     pole, and SECONDARY PROPELLANTS, I have A and C
     barber pole. [glossary:BMAG] temperatures?

[02:07:58:07]
LMP: Okay, AC 2 is showing zip. I'm going to try to
     reconfigure on that, Jack.

[02:07:58:13]
CC:  Roger.

[02:07:58:25]
LMP: Yes. We got a MAIN BUS A UNDERVOLT now, too,
     showing.

[02:07:58:29]
CC:  MAIN A UNDERVOLT.

[02:07:58:33]
LMP: It's reading about 25-1/2, MAIN B is reading zip
     right now.

[02:07:59:33]
CDR: And, Houston, Odyssey.

[02:07:59:38]
CC:  Stand by 1, Jim.

[02:08:00:35]
CC:  13, Houston. We'd like you to attempt to reconnect 
     fuel cell 1 to MAIN A and fuel cell 3 to MAIN B. Verify 
     that quad Delta is open.

[02:08:00:53]
LMP: Okay, Houston. I'm showing - I tried to reset
     and fuel cell 1 and 3 are both showing gray flags,
     but they are both showing zip on the flows.

[02:08:01:08]
CC:  We copy.

[02:08:03:17]
LMP: Okay, Houston. Are you still reading 13?

[02:08:03:20]
_page : 169
_tape : Tape 36/15
CC:  That's affirmative. We're reading you. We're
     trying to come up with some good ideas here for you.

[02:08:03:29]
LMP: Okay. Let me give you some reading ... in the
     interim to help MAIN A voltage, Jack. I've got BUS TIE AC on.

[02:08:03:37]
CC:  Say again, Fred.

[02:08:03:42]
LMP: In the interim, to help out MAIN A voltage, I've
     got MAIN BUS TIE BAT AC on. Or would you rather
     accept the 25 volts we are seeing on MAIN A?

[02:08:03:52]
CC:  Okay. BUS TIE AC on.

[02:08:04:09]
CC:  13, Houston. We need OMNI Charlie, please.

[02:08:04:19]
LMP: You got it.

[02:08:05:32]
CC:  13, Houston. We'd like you to verify couple of
     readings for us. We would like the nitrogen
     pressure on fuel cell 1. We need the oxygen pressure on fuel cell 2.

[02:08:05:46]
LMP: Okay. Nitrogen on 1 and oxygen on 2. Is that correct?

[02:08:05:50]
CC:  Negative. Oxygen on 3.

[02:08:05:54]
LMP: Okay.

[02:08:06:24]
LMP: Okay. The systems test 1-A says zip.

[02:08:06:44]
LMP: And 2 Baker, which is 3 oxygen, says 0.6.

[02:08:06:50]
CC:  2 Baker says 0.6, and say again the other one.

[02:08:06:57]
LMP: Fuel cell 1 nitrogen reads zero.

[02:08:07:01]
CC:  Roger. Zero.

[02:08:08:47]
CC:  13, Houston. We'd like you to open circuit fuel
     cell 1; leave 2 and 3 as is.

[02:08:08:55]
LMP: Okay. I'll get to work on that.

[02:08:08:57]
CDR: And, Jack, our O<sub>2</sub> quantity number 2 tank is
     reading zero. Did you get that?

[02:08:09:04]
CC:  O<sub>2</sub> QUANTITY number 2 is zero.

[02:08:09:07]
_page : 170
_tape : Tape 36/16
CDR: That's AC, okay. Yes, that's good AC and it
     looks to me, looking out the hatch, that we are
     venting something. We are venting something out
     into the - into space.

[02:08:09:22]
CC:  Roger. We copy your venting.

[02:08:09:29]
CDR: It's a gas of some sort.

[02:08:09:49]
LMP: Okay. Fuel cell 1, you just wanted it off the
     line now, Jack, is that right?

[02:08:09:52]
CC:  We just wanted you to open the circuit on fuel
     cell 1.

[02:08:09:58]
LMP: Okay. She's off the line.

[02:08:12:47]
CC:  13, Houston. We see you getting close to gimbal
     lock there. We'd like you to bring up all quad Cs
     on MAIN A, quad C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4 on MAIN A, and
     also bring B-3 and B-4 up on MAIN A.

[02:08:13:14]
CC:  13, Houston. Do you read?

[02:08:13:20]
LMP: Yes. We got it.

[02:08:13:21]
CDR: Affirm.

[02:08:13:22]
CC:  Okay. Can you tell us anything about the venting,
     where it is coming from, what window you see it at.

[02:08:13:30]
LMP: It's coming out of window 1, right now, Jack, and
     could you give me the thrusters again?

[02:08:13:35]
CC:  Okay, the thrusters - -

[02:08:13:37]
LMP: What buses?

     to your G&C checklist, the pink pages, 1-5. Do
     powerdown until we get a Delta of 10 amps. Over.

[02:08:16:21]
LMP: All right. Roger.

[02:08:17:03]
CDR: Okay, Jack, say again that - ... for the powerdown; it's not in the pink pages, the 1-5.

[02:08:17:10]

[02:08:18:08]
CC:  That's in your systems checklist, page 1-5.

[02:08:18:26]
CC:  And, 13, you might also check for those pages in
     your launch checklist. They're emergency pages;
     pink pages, 1-5, and we'd like you to power
     down until you get - -

[02:08:18:37]
CMP: Okay. That was in the launch checklist, Jack.

CMP: Okay, and something is giving us a reach, Jack,
     both in pitch and roll, so I'm suspecting that
     maybe it's whatever it is that's venting back
     there. I've had to use DIRECT in order to
     stabilize this, and as soon as I do, we're
     starting to pick up rates again. Can you pick
     up any jets firing?

[02:08:22:54]
CC:  Stand by. What direction are your rates in,
     Jack?

[02:08:23:06]

CC:  Okay, Fred. Thank you.

[02:08:45:55]
CMP: Jack, looking outside, the number of particles
     has diminished greatly, almost ceased now, which
     indicates maybe what was venting has almost
     stopped.

     of about 180. Our helium pressure is 3900. I'm
     looking at fuel pressure of about 180 and percentage 
     of about, I'd say 85 percent. B is about
     the same, except that that package pressure is
     190. On quad C, we're looking about the same,
     except that the package temperature is 100. On
     quad D, we're looking at package temperature of
     160. All other indications are about the same.
     [glossary:CM] pressure - [glossary:RCS] pressure is looking nominal.
     Helium pressure's up around 4000. And package

     right now we've got an O<sub>2</sub> or an H<sub>2</sub> FLOW reading
     of 0.13 to 0.14, and the O<sub>2</sub> FLOW is right now
     pegged full scale high although it has been varying 
     depending on thruster activity which has also
     given us MAIN BUS A under volts from a steady
     reading of about 1.1 up to full scale high. The
     T<sub>SKIN</sub> is about 445 and the CONDENSOR EXHAUST 17,
     correction, 180. Let's see if you want it on the

LMP: Are you saying fuel cell 1 and 2 - 1 and 2 are
     trying to hold up but we're leaking O<sub>2</sub> out of
     fuel cell 3? And you want me to shut the REAC
     valve on fuel cell 3? Did I hear you right?

[02:08:57:40]

     Our O<sub>2</sub> pressure is going down as you note and the
     temperature confirms it. Did you copy?

[02:09:15:24]
CMP: Okay. Well, what bus configuration - What main
     bus do you want powered?

[02:09:15:36]
CC:  Okay, Jack. We want you to leave the bus configuration as it is. Fuel cell 2 on MAIN A, and
     we need OMNI Bravo.

[02:09:15:52]
CMP: Okay, Jack. We're proceeding on the shutdown
     procedure for fuel cell 1.

[02:09:16:35]
CC:  And, 13, Houston. We'd like you to isolate the
     REPRESS package, please.

[02:09:16:42]
CMP: Okay.

[02:09:16:43]
CDR: Isolate the REPRESS package. Roger.

[02:09:16:45]
_page : 182
_tape : Tape 39/3
LMP: I can confirm REPRESS package is off.

[02:09:16:48]
CC:  Roger. So now you've got the REPRESS package
     and the surge tank isolated. Is that affirm?

[02:09:16:55]
LMP: That is Charlie.

[02:09:16:59]
CMP: Okay. Now, this is - We're ready to close the
     REACs on fuel cell 1; is that right?

[02:09:17:35]
CC:  Jack, stand by on the fuel - -

[02:09:17:36]
CMP: On that last - confirmation. Okay.

[02:09:17:41]
CC:  Roger. We're - We're giving you one last - -

[02:09:17:42]
CMP: We want to just get one last confirmation.

[02:09:17:45]
CC:  Okay, Jack. We're getting that last confirmation.
     Stand by, please.

[02:09:17:51]
CMP: Okay.

[02:09:18:01]
CC:  Okay, 13. We verify that we want you to close
     down - shut down fuel cell 1, close REACs valve.

[02:09:18:10]
CDR: Roger - -

[02:09:18:11]
CMP: Okay.

[02:09:18:12]
CDR: - - fuel cell 1; close the REACs valve.

[02:09:18:19]
CMP: Fuel - -

[02:09:18:20]
CDR: REACs valve on fuel cell 1 is closed.

[02:09:18:45]
CMP: Okay, Jack. I can confirm step 2. The fuel
     cell shutdown procedure is complete for fuel cell 1.

[02:09:18:55]
CC:  Roger.

[02:09:19:58]
CC:  13, we recommend that you enable BD roll in the [glossary:DAP]. Over.

[02:09:20:05]
CMP: Okay. Will do - -

[02:09:20:06]
CDR: BD roll in the [glossary:DAP].

[02:09:20:23]
CC:  13, Houston. We're working on the big dish now,
     so turn the HIGH GAIN POWER switch off, please.

[02:09:20:32]
_page : 183
_tape : Tape 39/4
LMP: Okay.

[02:09:20:55]
CMP: Okay, Jack. When we got the loud bang, we got
     also a restart. Did you copy that? Is - does
     [glossary:GUIDO] want anything, a [glossary:VERB 74] or anything done
     with the [glossary:CMC]?

[02:09:21:06]
CC:  Stand by.

[02:09:21:54]
CC:  13, Houston. We're ready with a [glossary:VERB 74] now, please.

[02:09:22:05]
CMP: Coming down at you.

[02:09:23:54]
CMP: Okay, Jack. It looks like O<sub>2</sub> tank 1 pressure is
     just a hair over 200.

[02:09:24:02]
CC:  We confirm that here and the temperature also confirms it.

[02:09:24:09]
CMP: Okay. Does it look like it's still going down?

[02:09:24:12]
CC:  It's slowly going to zero, and we're starting to
     think about the [glossary:LM] lifeboat.

[02:09:24:20]
CMP: Yes. That's what we're thinking about, too. You
     want me to do a quick [glossary:P52]? It kind of looks
     like - We've been talking it over, and it kind
     of looks like we'd probably aline our plats -
     [glossary:LM] platform with our platform and then power down
     the [glossary:CM], and keep the [glossary:LM] powered up doing a [glossary:DPS] -
     whatever [glossary:DPS] burns you give us?

[02:09:24:54]
CC:  13, we're not going to concern ourselves at the
     moment with a [glossary:DPS] burn. It's going to be some
     time before we'd get to that; but we're working
     on other procedures to give you, which will allow
     us to use the [glossary:LM] systems. Over.

[02:09:25:12]
CMP: Okay. Real fine.

[02:09:26:40]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston. We'd like to charge battery A
     now.

[02:09:26:46]
CDR: Charge battery A. Roger.

[02:09:27:13]
CC:  And, Jack, in regard to your question about the
     [glossary:P52] and [glossary:LM] platform, it's - There's no need to
     worry about that now. We wouldn't be using the
     [glossary:LM] platform for - until about 79 hours, so let's
     go as is on the platform for now. Over.

[02:09:27:30]
_page : 184
_tape : Tape 39/5
CDR: Okay. We understand.

[02:09:27:37]
CMP: Okay, Jack.

[02:09:30:13]
CMP: And, Jack, we've turned off the waste dump
     heater. If you're going to consider dumping
     any more waste water, we probably ought to do it
     while the duct is warm there.

[02:09:30:30]
CC:  Roger. Stand by, Jack.

[02:09:30:34]
CMP: Okay.

[02:09:30:38]
CC:  Okay, Jack. Let's keep the water; no need for
     a dump right now.

[02:09:30:44]
CMP: All right.

[02:09:32:15]
CC:  13, Houston. We see the PROP ISOL valve on [glossary:RCS]
     quad Charlie closed, so we'd like to also disable
     AUTO [glossary:RCS] feature in quad Charlie.

[02:09:32:30]
CDR: You want to isolate the AUTO [glossary:RCS] features in
     quad Charlie?

[02:09:32:33]
CC:  Affirmative.

[02:09:32:44]
CDR: Okay, Jack. I didn't plan to reset that quad
     Charlie DROP ISOL valve. Do you want me to do
     that? Okay. We just tried it and quad Alfa and
     Charlie barber poles are showing.

[02:09:33:01]
CC:  Stand by, Jim.

[02:09:33:03]
CMP: Okay, Jack. That's the sec - secondary propellant
     barber poles on Alfa and Charlie.

[02:09:34:47]
CC:  13, Houston. It won't do any good to try to
     power the propellant valves on A and C, so we
     want you to disable the AUTO on [glossary:RCS] Charlie.
     And we have a procedure for getting power from
     the [glossary:LM] we'd like you to copy down.

[02:09:35:08]
CMP: Okay.

[02:09:35:09]
CDR: Stand by, Jack.

[02:09:35:11]
CMP: That sounds like good news.

[02:09:36:05]
LMP: Okay, Jack. About how long is it?

[02:09:36:12]
_page : 185
_tape : Tape 39/6
CC:  It's not a very long procedure, Fred. We figure
     we've got about 15 minutes' worth of power left
     in the command module, so we want you to start
     getting over in the [glossary:LM] and getting some power on
     that. And, you ready to copy your procedure?

[02:09:36:27]
LMP: Okay.

[02:09:36:29]
CC:  Okay. In the [glossary:CSM].

[02:09:36:30]
LMP: Stand by.

[02:09:36:40]
LMP: Go ahead.

[02:09:36:41]
CC:  Okay. In the [glossary:CSM] on panel 5, circuit breakers
     [glossary:LM] POWER 1 and 2, OPEN. Then [glossary:LM] POWER switch,
     reset and release. In the [glossary:LM], on panel 11 and
     panel 16, TRANSLUNAR BUS TIE. Both circuit
     breakers CLOSE. On panel 16, circuit breaker
     ASCENT ECA CONTROL, CLOSE. On 16, DESCENT
     ECA CONTROL, CLOSE. On panel 14, put your
     BAT 5 NORMAL feed ON. BATs 1, 2, 3, and 4
     LOW VOLTAGE taps, ON. BAT 5 NORMAL feed,
     OFF. ASCENT ECA CONTROL, OPEN. You copy?

[02:09:38:08]
LMP: Stand by 1.

[02:09:38:24]
LMP: Okay. In the [glossary:CSM], on panel 5, we want CB [glossary:LM]
     POWER 1 and 2, OPEN. Then the [glossary:LM] POWER switch
     to reset, release. In the [glossary:LM], panels 11 and 16,
     X LUNAR BUS TIE breakers closed. On panel 16,
     the ASCENT ECA CONTROL closed; the DESCENT ECA
     CONTROL closed. On panel 14, BAT 5 NORMAL feed
     ON, followed by BATS 1, 2, 3, and 4 LOW VOLTAGE
     taps ON. Then BAT 5 NORMAL feed OFF. Then
     ASCENT ECA CONTROL breaker OPEN.

[02:09:38:58]
CC:  That's a good readback, Fred.

[02:09:39:14]
CC:  And, 13, Houston. As a final effort here, we
     would like you to turn on the fans in tank 2.
     Over.

[02:09:39:23]
CDR: Roger. Understand. Turn on the fans in tank 2.

[02:09:39:34]
CDR: You want the O<sub>2</sub> fans in tank 2, Jack?

[02:09:39:38]
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim.

[02:09:39:45]
CDR: O<sub>2</sub> tanks - fans in tank 2 are on.

_page : 186
_tape : Tape 39/7
CC:  Roger.

[02:09:41:31]
CC:  13, Houston. We'd like you to start making your
     way over to the [glossary:LM] now.

[02:09:41:38]
CMP: Fred and Jim are in the [glossary:LM].

[02:09:41:42]
CC:  Okay, Jack. Thank you.

[02:09:41:47]
LMP: And, Jack, I got [glossary:LM] power on.

[02:09:42:50]
CMP: Okay. You still with us, Houston?

[02:09:43:03]
CMP: Okay, Houston. You read 13?

[02:09:43:06]
CC:  Reading you loud and clear, Jack. I've got a
     procedure for - -

[02:09:43:10]
CMP: Okay.

[02:09:43:11]
CC:  - - the guys in the [glossary:LM].

[02:09:43:15]
LMP: You got another one?

[02:09:43:17]
CC:  I have an activation procedure. I'd like you to
     copy it down.

[02:09:43:25]
CDR: How long is it, Jack?

[02:09:43:27]
CC:  It's just four lines. Go to Activation 1, do
     step 3. Go to Activation 11, omit step 1. Do
     Activation 12, and then go to Activation 13 and
     do step 1. Do you copy?

[02:09:43:54]
CDR: Okay. Is that Activation 1? Do step 3. Is
     that correct?

[02:09:43:59]
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim.

[02:09:44:03]
CDR: Activation 11, omit step 1, do the rest. Is that
     correct?

[02:09:44:06]
CC:  That's affirmative.

[02:09:44:12]
CDR: Do Activation 12 and Activation 13, step 1.
_comment: "PDF transcript says 'Do Activation 1 and...' which we believe is obviously wrong, but should check audio when it becomes available."

[02:09:44:14]
CC:  That's all correct.

[02:09:44:25]
CMP: Okay, Jack. Pressure in tank 1 is approaching
     100 psi. What's going to be the symptoms of
     this fuel cell starting to drop off?

[02:09:44:51]
_page : 187
_tape : Tape 39/8
CC:  Stand by, Jack. We'll get the word on that.

[02:09:44:56]
CMP: Okay.

[02:09:45:06]
CC:  And, Jim, when you get to the end of that
     procedure, we'd also like to have you put the
     DEMAND REGs to CABIN.

[02:09:45:15]
CDR: DEMAND REGs to CABIN. Roger.

[02:09:45:31]
CDR: Jack, was that Activation 1, step 3 only,
     or all of Activation 1?

[02:09:45:38]
CC:  That's go all the way down to step 3, Jim.

[02:09:45:44]
CDR: Activation 1 to step 3. Roger.

[02:09:46:48]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 13. Never mind.

[02:09:46:54]
CC:  13, say again, please.

[02:09:46:58]
CDR: Oh, we were curious about Activation 11 on the VHF.

[02:09:47:04]
CC:  Omit the VHF.

[02:09:47:05]
CDR: - - ... Jack. It's got - Okay.

[02:09:48:17]
CC:  Jack, this is Houston. We want you to keep
     the [glossary:IMU] up and keep the lights on so you can
     see in there, and leave battery off - battery A
     off and, at the appropriate time, we'll put it
     on MAIN A. And we're going to keep the [glossary:IMU] up
     so's we can get a coarse aline in the [glossary:LM].

[02:09:48:38]
CMP: All right. Real good. Right now, we're
     charging battery A. Do you want to discontinue
     that?

[02:09:48:46]
CC:  Discontinue the charge on battery A, Jack.

[02:09:49:22]
CMP: Okay, Jack. I discontinued charge on battery A.
     You give me the call and I'll turn BUS TIE AC
     on.

[02:09:49:32]
CC:  Roger. And we want you to keep the lights up
     and the [glossary:IMU] on.

[02:09:49:38]
CMP: Okay.

[02:09:49:48]
CC:  And, Jack, we'd like you to leave the COMM
     configuration as is until we get COMM with the [glossary:LM].

[02:09:49:57]
_page : 188
_tape : Tape 39/9
CMP: Okay.

[02:09:50:08]
CC:  And, 13, this is Houston. I've got another
     procedure for the [glossary:LM]. A short one.

[02:09:51:15]
CDR: Okay. Ready to copy, Jack.

[02:09:51:17]
CC:  Okay. On panel 11, we'd like you to close
     the [glossary:LGC] [glossary:DSKY] circuit breaker. Then we want
     you to go to Activation 25; do steps 1, 2,
     and 3. Then go to Activation 30, and that
     will give us a docked [glossary:IMU] coarse aline. Over.

[02:09:51:41]
CDR: Roger. Panel 11, close [glossary:LGC] circuit breaker.
     Activation 25, do steps 1, 2, 3, and then do
     complete Activation 30. Is that correct?

[02:09:51:50]
CC:  That's affirmative. On panel 11, [glossary:LGC] [glossary:DSKY]
     circuit breaker closed.

[02:09:53:15]
CC:  And in the [glossary:LM], let's go to panel 11 and close
     the SUIT FAN circuit breaker and get suit fan 1 cranked up.

[02:09:53:26]
CDR: Okay. Panel 11, close SUIT FAN circuit breaker,
     and we'll get the suit fan cranked up.

[02:09:53:30]
CC:  That's affirm.

[02:09:53:47]
CC:  And, Jack, in the [glossary:CSM], go to BYPASS on the
     radiators and turn your GLYCOL PUMP off.

[02:09:53:56]
CMP: Okay. Pull the BYPASS; GLYCOL PUMP going off.

[02:09:54:04]
CC:  Roger.

[02:09:55:42]
CC:  And, 13, in the [glossary:CSM], we want to verify that all
     the fuel cell pumps are off, and we want to have
     you turn off the O<sub>2</sub> fans in the tank 2.

[02:09:55:56]
CMP: Okay. Tank 2 fans going off. Okay. That leaves
     me with tank 1 fans on the tank 1 heaters on.

[02:09:56:08]
CC:  That's affirm.

[02:09:56:10]
CMP: Fuel cell 2 pump going off now.

CDR: The [glossary:LM] middle gimbal is 011.79.

[02:10:10:22]
CC:  011.79. Got it.

[02:10:12:10]
CMP: Houston. ... flashing.

[02:10:12:19]
CC:  Odyssey, Houston. We need a command reset on your -
     on your COMM, and then we'd like you to power down
     to [glossary:CMC], power down the [glossary:IMU], heaters off on the [glossary:IMU],
     but leave the battery A on.

[02:10:12:43]
CMP: Yes.

[02:10:12:58]
CC:  Odyssey, Houston.

[02:10:13:08]
LMP: Ask him if he's ...

[02:10:13:10]
CDR: Yes.

[02:10:13:11]
LMP: Are you ...?

[02:10:13:12]
CDR: Yes.

[02:10:13:13]
CDR: Houston, this is Odyssey. Go ahead.

[02:10:13:16]
CC:  Okay, Jim - -

[02:10:13:18]
CDR: Copy it down.

[02:10:13:20]
_page : 192
_tape : Tape 39/13
CC:  Okay, Jim. I think I'm reading Jack, now. But
     what we want him to do is to give us a command
     reset. And then power down the [glossary:CMC], power down
     the [glossary:IMU], turn the [glossary:IMU] heater off, leave battery A on. Over.

[02:10:14:19]
CMP: That's just about 80 - in fact, 82 hours out of
     the two primary cartridges. That's two guys.
     44 is what LC8 got. That would be 88 hours. We got
     a secondary. You're right. We're listening.

[02:10:14:41]
CC:  Odyssey, Houston.

[02:10:14:43]
CMP: They can stand it - Go ahead?

[02:10:14:47]
CC:  Yes, Jack. Did you copy down about the [glossary:CMC] [glossary:IMU]?

[02:10:14:52]
CMP: Yes, Jack. I read it back twice to you. Command
     reset, which I've done. I'm about to power down
     the [glossary:IMU], power down the [glossary:CMC], turn the [glossary:IMU] heaters
     off, leave BAT A on.

[02:10:15:07]
CC:  That's affirm. Thank you.

[02:10:15:11]
CMP: Okay. I just got a MASTER ALARM and MAIN BUS A
     UNDERVOLT. And I'm starting to power down, now. - -

[02:10:15:21]
LMP: We've lost - The only advantage to doing it early;
     if we can power back - the [glossary:LM] back down. The only
     advantage doing it early is you can do a big burn
     now and a midcourse and then power the [glossary:LM] down.
     Otherwise, we got to keep the [glossary:LM] powered up clear
     until we get around the Moon. Plus it would be
     inside on the burn. I just hope the G&N hangs up
     on - hangs in on this one - I'd sure hate to do
     that one manual.

[02:10:16:05]
CDR: Oh boy.

[02:10:16:06]
CC:  Odyssey, Houston. Couple circuit breakers for
     you. On panel 276, on our INSTRUMENTATION POWER
     CONTROL, open CB number 3 and number 4.

[02:10:16:33]
CMP: Okay, Houston. Panel 276, INSTRUMENTATION out
     and reset - -

[02:10:16:39]
CMP: - - a lot of light.

[02:10:16:40]
LMP: - - CB-3 and CB-4 are open.

[02:10:16:45]
CMP: What?

[02:10:16:47]
_page : 193
_tape : Tape 39/14
CC: That's affirmative, Odyssey. And also get your
     [glossary:SCS] electronics package and power off, and your
     [glossary:FDAI] POWER/GPI off, and your AUTO jet SELECT, all 16 off.

[02:10:17:07]
CMP: Okay. Well, wait a second. Let me - Let me get
     the [glossary:CMC] power down.

[02:10:17:13]
CC:  Roger, Jack.

[02:10:17:16]
LMP: I wonder how much that's going to bring this up,
     here.

[02:10:17:28]
CDR: Jack, while he's doing that, copy down what you
     just said again. I want to write it down.

[02:10:17:36]
CC:  Aquarius, we need to get your sublimator powered
     up, Activation page 20 and Activation page 21, step 3. Over.

[02:10:17:52]
CDR: Roger. Activation page 20 and Activation page 21,
     step 3, sublimator.

[02:10:17:58]
CC:  Roger.

[02:10:18:00]
CMP: That's Activation, page 20? Okay, Jack. Now I
     have to power down [glossary:IMU]. I have no control at all.
     I'm going to turn my 16 jets off, Say again the
     other things you wanted?

[02:10:18:28]
CC:  Okay, Jack. We'd like you to turn off your O<sub>2</sub> tank
     2 heaters and fans. Correction - tank 1. Turn
     the fans and heaters off.

[02:10:18:41]
CDR: Okay. And, Jack, can we turn on the [glossary:FDAI] circuit
     breakers so we could have a ball to see if we go to gimbal lock or not?

[02:10:18:49]
CC:  Stand by.

[02:10:18:53]
CMP: Houston, he's going to give a 16 [glossary:NOUN 20], Jack.
     And, okay, I've got O<sub>2</sub> heaters and fans off in
     tank 1.

[02:10:19:15]
CDR: And, Jack, let me know if you get close to gimbal
     lock, would you?

[02:10:19:25]
CC:  Jim, we don't want you to power down the ball in
     the [glossary:LM]. We wanted you to power down the ball in
     the [glossary:CSM].

[02:10:19:39]
_page : 194
_tape : Tape 39/15
CMP: Jack, they haven't powered down - -

[02:10:19:42]
CDR: Jack, we don't have the balls powered up in the
     [glossary:LM].

[02:10:19:45]
CMP: I have the [glossary:CMC] and [glossary:IMU] in the command module is
     powered down. The heaters are out.

[02:10:19:56]
LMP: And the EVAP flow valve, that's open now, and I've
     undone my suit hoses here and opened up the suit
     flow valves; so, we got air flowing in the [glossary:LM] now.

[02:10:20:11]
CMP: Okay, Jack. Will you say again the [glossary:SCS] items you
     wanted me to power down?

[02:10:20:45]
CMP: Okay, Houston. Do you read Odyssey?

[02:10:20:55]
CDR: Hello, Houston. How do you read?

[02:10:21:01]
LMP: His gimbal lock and ours are different, Jim.

[02:10:21:09]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston. Say again, please. You were
     cut out.

[02:10:21:15]
CMP: Okay, Jack. Do you want me to proceed by the [glossary:SCS]
     powerdown checklist? I did not copy the [glossary:SCS]
     items you wanted me to power down.

[02:10:21:32]
CC:  Okay, Odyssey. We want to go [glossary:SCS] ELECTRONICS POWER,
     OFF.

[02:10:21:39]
CMP: Okay. It's done.

[02:10:21:41]
CC:  [glossary:FDAI] POWER/GPI, OFF. AUTO jet SELECT, 16 - -

[02:10:21:47]
CMP: That's done.

[02:10:21:48]
CC:  - - OFF. And all your ROTATIONAL CONTROL POWER,
     OFF.

[02:10:21:52]
CMP: It's done. ROTATION CONTROL POWER, DIRECT, and
     AUTO ..., OFF.

[02:10:21:59]
CDR: Okay, Jack. Tell me there. We need to know when
     we're getting close to gimbal lock in the [glossary:LM].
     We have no balls right now.

[02:10:22:06]
CC:  Okay. We want you to power up your eight-ball.
     We want you to get your [glossary:RCS] heaters on. Pressurize the [glossary:RCS] and open up the MAIN SOVs. Over.

[02:10:22:23]
_page : 195
_tape : Tape 39/16
LMP: Okay, Jack. I got two commander [glossary:FDAI] breakers in,
     AC and DC, and the two GASTA breakers in AC and
     DC and next you'll want the [glossary:RCS] heaters all on
     with the - pressurize the [glossary:RCS] and then the MAIN
     SOVs open. And I think they're already open.

[02:10:22:40]
CC:  Roger. And, Fred-o, get the TCA breakers in last.
     Please.

[02:10:23:00]
LMP: Roger, Jim. I'm holding open those until you give
     me a further word anyway. I'm just going to
     pressurize right now.

[02:10:23:08]
CDR: Jack, are you reading [glossary:LM] gimbal angles?

[02:10:23:38]
CMP: - - ... power off, come down here and ... the
     audio ...

[02:10:24:16]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. I have some gyro torquing angles
     and the Odyssey is powered down, attitude-control-wise, so [glossary:LM]'s got attitude control now.

[02:10:25:13]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[02:10:25:21]
LMP: Go ahead, Jack.

[02:10:25:24]
CC:  Okay. We want you to know that we got some gyro
     torquing angles for you. And we want you to tell
     us when you got attitude control in the [glossary:LM].

[02:10:25:38]
LMP: Okay. We're still working on the pressurization.
     I'm getting Jim on the horn here so he can help
     out, there.

[02:10:25:43]
CC:  Roger.

[02:10:26:09]
CMP: Wonder why.

[02:10:26:14]
LMP: We got to get this pressurized.

[02:10:26:55]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[02:10:26:58]
CC:  Stand by 1, Aquarius, Odyssey. We'd like you to
     go DIRECT [glossary:RCS] and hold your present attitude out
     the window until the [glossary:LM] gets [glossary:RCS] powered up.
     Go ahead, Jim.

[02:10:27:12]
CDR: Well, that's my question. We're not - Our 16 20
     doesn't match our eight-ball here. We went to
     [glossary:FDAI]s ON, and we don't have our balls completely
     powered up. There may be a ... and our angles
     don't look the same and we don't want to go into
     gimbal lock.

[02:10:27:28]
_page : 196
_tape : Tape 39/17
CC:  Roger. How far are you from [glossary:RCS] power up - [glossary:RCS]
     pressurization?

[02:10:27:45]
LMP: Okay, Jack. I'm right up to where it's MASTER
     ARM, ON; [glossary:RCS], FIRE; - -

[02:10:27:49]
MS:  ...

[02:10:27:50]
LMP: - - both LOGIC POWERs out ... goes into normal
     circuit-breaker. ... Do you want A in and then
     I'll fire them?

[02:10:27:59]
CC:  Okay, 13. You're both talking at once. One at
     a time, please.

[02:10:28:10]
CMP: Okay. Who's first?

[02:10:28:11]
CC:  Close LOGIC POWER A and B, Fred, and pressurize
     [glossary:RCS].

[02:10:28:17]
LMP: Okay.

[02:10:28:24]
CC:  Go ahead, Odyssey.

[02:10:28:29]
CMP: Okay. I'm going to try to do the best I can. I've
     got a one-attitude reference I'm going to fly
     according to the lunar terminator.

[02:10:28:37]
CC:  Roger, Jack. Just maintain attitude.

[02:10:29:04]
CMP: What am I doing? I can't do that, anyway. Let's
     see, cross feed. Nope. Now, and -

[02:10:29:25]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We'll have to get some AC up
     so you can get a ball reading. Close your BUS
     TIE INVERTER circuit breakers, all four of them
     on panel 11. Close your AC BUS VOLT circuit
     breaker on panel 11. On panel 16, INVERTER 2,
     CLOSE. Select inverter 2. Over.

[02:10:29:50]
CDR: That's been completed, Jack.

[02:10:29:58]
LMP: Okay. The [glossary:RCS] is pressurized now.

[02:10:30:39]
LMP: Okay, Jack. Do you want us to proceed right on
     down the line with the [glossary:RCS] check-out and Activation 37 now?

[02:10:30:51]
CC:  Stand by, Fred.

[02:10:31:03]
LMP: Hell, is he still firing up there?

[02:10:31:15]
_page : 197
_tape : Tape 39/18
CC:  Okay, Fred. Negative on the activation on page 37.
     Go on to your [glossary:RCS] pressurize and then get your TCA
     breakers in and go to [glossary:PGNS] attitude hold.

[02:10:31:53]
CDR: Okay, Jack. How do you read?

[02:10:31:56]
CC:  Okay, Jim. This is Houston. We want you to load
     the [glossary:DAP] with 30120.

[02:10:32:06]
CDR: Load the [glossary:DAP] with 30120. Complete.

[02:10:32:16]
LMP: Okay. We need to change that [glossary:CSM] weight.

[02:10:32:25]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. Your [glossary:CSM] weight is 63400.

[02:10:32:51]
CDR: And Jack's alive to take control the [glossary:LM] to stay
     away from gimbal lock. Over.

[02:10:32:58]
CC:  Affirmative. Take control of the [glossary:LM]. [glossary:PGNS]
     ATTITUDE HOLD.

[02:10:33:06]
LMP: We are.

[02:10:33:08]
CC:  And, Odyssey, request you coordinate with Aquarius
     on attitude control.

[02:10:33:16]
CMP: Okay.

[02:10:33:17]
CDR: Roger.

[02:10:33:19]
CDR: Okay. I don't see where you're firing these
     things ...

[02:10:33:22]
SC:  Oh?

[02:10:33:27]
CDR: Are you firing anything?

[02:10:33:28]
CMP: I don't think so.

[02:10:33:54]
CDR: Okay. I got DIRECT.

[02:10:34:04]
CC:  And, Aquarius, check you ATCA (PGNS) breaker on
     panel 11 in.

[02:10:34:13]
CDR: Say again.

[02:10:34:15]
CC:  Close, on panel 11, circuit breaker ATCA (PGNS).

[02:10:34:21]
CDR: ATCA (PGNS). Come on. Let's take it easy now.

[02:10:34:30]
CDR: Okay. We've got ATCA (PGNS) closed.

[02:10:34:31]
_page : 198
_tape : Tape 39/19
LMP: Yes.

[02:10:34:32]
CDR: Is that okay?

[02:10:34:34]
LMP: Yes.

[02:10:34:35]
CDR: Okay. Now I'm looking.

[02:10:34:37]
LMP: ... okay ...

[02:10:34:46]
CMP: How about plus?

[02:10:34:48]
LMP: No. ...

[02:10:34:49]
CDR: Okay. It's already open.

[02:10:34:53]
CDR: Okay. Slow down.

[02:10:34:58]
LMP: Okay, Jack. We got it.

[02:10:35:16]
CDR: Yes.

[02:10:35:21]
CC:  Okay, Jim. How's the attitude control?

[02:10:35:27]
CDR: Okay, Jack. We've got attitude control now in
     the [glossary:LM]. We're going to try to rotate up through
     the bellyband.

[02:10:35:34]
CC:  Roger.

[02:10:35:38]
CDR: I like that sound like I got back there.

[02:10:35:59]
CC:  Odyssey, Houston. I've got a procedure for you.

[02:10:36:05]
CMP: Okay, Jack. I'm ...

[02:10:36:09]
CDR: I want to go up this way to get away from that -
     the radios are powered, huh?

[02:10:36:16]
CMP: Yes.

[02:10:36:33]
CDR: Check your antenna?

[02:10:36:37]
CMP: Okay, Jack. Odyssey is ready to copy.

[02:10:36:40]
CC:  Okay, Jack. What we want you to do is close the
     reactants valve on fuel cell 2. Power down your
     inverters. Power down your battery relay bus.
     Battery ties, off, and pull your entry circuit
     breakers, entry battery circuit breakers A, B,
     and C.

[02:10:37:15]
_page : 199
_tape : Tape 39/20
CMP: Check the control, and make sure we don't go to
     gimbal lock, Fred.

[02:10:37:21]
CMP: Okay, Jack; understand. Close REAC valve circuit
     breakers in fuel cell 2. Power down inverters.
     Power down BAT relay bus. BAT TIES, OFF. Power
     entry and both running circuit breakers A, B,
     and C. All off.

[02:10:37:41]
_extra : END OF TAPE
CC:  That's affirmative, Jack. And close the reactant
     valve on fuel cell 2, there.

[02:10:37:50]
_page : 200
_tape : Tape 40/1
CDR: Okay. I'll do that, and Jack'll do that other.

[02:10:38:02]
CC:  Okay, Jack; on fuel cell 2, open circuit it.

[02:10:38:18]
CMP: Okay. Fuel cell 2 is open circuited. Do you
     want me to go through the standard shutdown procedure for the REAC valves and -

[02:10:38:37]
CC:  Odyssey, Houston. All you have to do is close
     the REACs valve on fuel cell 2.

[02:10:38:42]
CMP: Okay. CB REACs and vent REAC valves all closed.

[02:10:39:24]
CMP: Yes.

[02:10:39:55]
CDR: Yes.

[02:10:39:58]
LMP: ... an hour and a half.

[02:10:40:01]
CDR: Okay.

[02:10:40:06]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[02:10:40:09]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[02:10:40:12]
CDR: Okay. Odyssey is completely powered down, according to the procedure that you read to Jack.

[02:10:40:22]
CC:  Roger; we copy. That's where we want to be, Jim.

[02:10:40:36]
LMP: And, Jack, have you all got good [glossary:LM] data down
     there now?

[02:10:40:47]
CC:  That's affirmative, Fred. We're getting good
     [glossary:LM] data.

[02:10:40:53]
LMP: Okay. In that case, I think I'll pull out some
     display breakers and just let you all keep an
     eye on things.

[02:10:41:02]
CC:  Roger.

[02:10:41:04]
CDR: He's turning his lights off now, too.

[02:10:41:06]
CC:  Stand by 1 on that, Fred.

[02:10:41:18]
LMP: Okay.

[02:10:41:21]
CDR: What about these lights up here?

[02:10:41:30]
_page : 201
_tape : Tape 40/2
LMP: I've got it.

[02:10:41:32]
CDR: Okay.

[02:10:41:34]
LMP: Where would you like ...?

[02:10:41:37]
CDR: ...

[02:10:41:47]
LMP: Oh.

[02:10:42:41]
CDR: We don't want to lose COMM with him.

[02:10:42:45]
LMP: I'm watching it.

[02:10:43:52]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Stand by on opening your
     circuit breakers for displays. We're going to
     let you know what they are, and I have some gyro
     torquing angles for you.

[02:10:44:10]
LMP: Okay. What page is that there gyro torquing?

[02:10:44:12]
CDR: Okay. What page is the, do we write the gyro
     torquing angles on there, Jack?

[02:10:44:17]
CC:  Stand by.

[02:10:44:18]
LMP: Okay. We're there now, Jim. Jim's got it. Go
     ahead with the gyro torquing angles.

[02:10:44:24]
CC:  Okay. We'd like you to proceed with the fine
     aline and your gyro torquing angles are
     X plus 003.30, Y plus 024.80, Z minus 015.10.
     Over.

[02:10:44:48]
CDR: Okay. I read your gyro torquing angles as
     plus 003.30, Y is plus 023, I only have four
     numbers for Y; you'll have to give that one to me
     again, and Z is minus 015.10. Read Y again,
     please.

[02:10:45:06]
CC:  Okay, Jim. X and Z are correct and Y is
     plus 024.80.

[02:10:45:19]
CDR: Okay. We read Y as plus 024.80. We'll proceed
     on Activation 40 to fine aline the platform.

[02:10:45:28]
CC:  Roger. Okay, Aquarius, proceed as on page 40
     with [glossary:IMU] fine aline.

[02:10:47:41]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Can you see any stars out the
     [glossary:LM] window?

[02:10:47:53]
_page : 202
_tape : Tape 40/3
LMP: We'll have to wipe them off, Jack. They're
     coated with water right now.

[02:10:47:59]
CDR: Can I get a towel?

[02:10:48:00]
LMP: Yes.

[02:10:48:01]
CC:  Roger. As soon as you get a chance to - on your
     position - to take a look, we'd like to know if
     you can see stars for alinement purposes.

[02:10:48:16]
LMP: Okay. Jim's going to be in trouble in our present
     attitude out his side. The Sun's there.

     battery A? Okay. I wish I knew what the hell
     they were thinking right now ... - -

[02:10:48:51]
CDR: They're talking about powering down and doing
     a [glossary:P51] here?

[02:10:48:57]
LMP: No. They were just thinking about [glossary:P52] - -

[02:10:49:00]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Negative on the [glossary:P51]. We want
     to stay just like we are, but we'd like to be able
     to correlate what you're doing with some simulator
     work we're going to crank up. And so if you can
     give us information as to what stars you can see
     out the window, we can make that correlation.

[02:10:49:22]
CDR: Would you say one more time? Give me the top two.
     The top two.

[02:10:49:33]
CC:  Jim, what we want you to do is go with your current fine aline and disregard the [glossary:P51]. What we're
     attempting to do is to crank up some LMS simulations to correlate what we can get out your window
     with what we can get out the LMS window to see if
     that will help us any. So when you can see some
     stars, if you can, you think you can recognize
     them and recognize constellations, please let us
     know.

[02:10:50:02]
CDR: Okay. We'll check. Stand by.

[02:10:51:40]
CDR: Okay. Here, unplug this.

[02:10:52:13]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We notice that the O<sub>2</sub> pressure in the ASCENT TANK O<sub>2</sub> is a little high, so
     we want to use some of it. So close DESCENT O<sub>2</sub>
     and open ASCENT O<sub>2</sub>, tank 2. Over.

[02:10:52:45]
LMP: Okay, Jack. Switch now on ASCENT number 2 O<sub>2</sub>
     tank, DESCENT O<sub>2</sub> is closed.

[02:10:52:53]

[02:10:54:01]
CDR: Okay, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read?

[02:10:54:05]
CC:  Reading you 5 square, Jim. Go ahead.

[02:10:54:09]
CDR: Okay. I'm looking out of Fred's window. I see
     a lot of particles out there, but a lot of that
     stuff is still drifting away from us, so a lot
     of it is flashing in the local vicinity, and I
     don't recognize any constellations right now,
     in this particular attitude.

[02:10:54:34]
CC:  Okay, Jim. If that status changes, please let
     us know.

[02:10:54:41]
CDR: Roger. We're continuing to drift. Okay, get
     your [glossary:TTCA|TTCAs] to roll.

[02:10:54:54]
LMP: [glossary:TTCA] ...

[02:10:55:08]
CC:  And, Aquarius; Houston. I've got some circuit
     breakers you can open to power down displays.
     In addition, I have a [glossary:P30] maneuver pad. Over.

[02:10:55:28]
LMP: Get the [glossary:LM] data - get the [glossary:LM] book.

[02:10:55:32]

     give me all the [glossary:LM] stuff.

[02:10:56:45]

     Okay, you're moving away.

[02:11:00:48]
CC:  Okay, Fred, I've got six circuit breakers for you.

[02:11:00:54]
LMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[02:11:00:56]
CC:  Okay, they're all on panel 11. Row 1 under AC
     BUS B, open HELIUM PQGS for PROPELLANT DISPLAY.

[02:11:01:07]
LMP: It's OPEN.

[02:11:01:08]

     NA. And I have two gimbal trim angles for you
     which will be updated. Right now, however, we
     want you to go with pitch 5.86, roll 6.75. Over.

[02:11:03:37]

     a pitch and roll angle for what?

[02:11:03:47]
CC:  That's for your [glossary:DPS] trim.

[02:11:03:48]
CDR: Those were gimbal angles for - pitch and yaw.

[02:11:03:54]

[02:11:04:44]
LMP: - - N slash A in the [glossary:COAS], and you gave me GDA
     angles of pitch 5.86, and you want roll 6.75.

[02:11:04:56]

     water.

[02:11:05:06]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Say again, please.

[02:11:05:13]
LMP: Okay. We didn't answer back there, Jack. Check
     to see if you're on VOX.

[02:11:05:19]
CDR: No.

[02:11:05:22]
LMP: Neither am I, okay. Why the hell are we maneuvering at all now? Are we still venting?

[02:11:05:34]
CDR: Well, we're at ATT HOLD for one thing - I mean,
     we're at MINIMUM IMPULSE.

[02:11:05:38]
LMP: No, I mean why can't you null them out, somewhere?

[02:11:05:41]
CDR: Every time I try to - I can't take that doggone
     roll out. I got to wait until they get around to
     the bellyband.

[02:11:05:50]
LMP: Wait a minute. Do you - you fight roll by using
     the [glossary:TTCA] left right. That's what you need to play
     with.

[02:11:06:04]
CDR: Okay. We'll try that. Let me get around though.
     Let's roll. Let it roll all the way.

[02:11:06:12]
_page : 207

LMP: Yes, you can't let it roll all the way.

[02:11:06:13]

[02:11:06:16]
LMP: Okay. Then until it's upside down at least, huh?

[02:11:06:18]
CDR: Yes.

[02:11:06:19]
LMP: Okay. Well, should I ask him what the return
     time on that one is? Or are you interested?

[02:11:06:31]
CDR: Let's get the first things first.

[02:11:06:43]
LMP: Oh, you don't want to hear. Let me figure some
     times out here. That's at 79, and what are we
     at now? About - do we - do we - do we even know
     any better computer time, do we?

[02:11:06:57]
CDR: No.

[02:11:07:00]
LMP: Hey, Jack. Do you still have a mission timer?
     You don't? Okay.

[02:11:07:07]
CDR: I'll tell you what. Let's ask - let's ask Houston
     to give us a mission timer, computer time. They
     can up link it to us. Okay, hold it.

[02:11:07:18]
LMP: Go ahead.

[02:11:07:20]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[02:11:07:21]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[02:11:07:25]
CDR: You know, we don't have a - I don't think we have
     a computer clock going, and why don't you up link
     that stuff to us?

[02:11:07:31]
CC:  Roger.

[02:11:07:40]
CC:  And, Fred-o, I got some fast circuit breakers on
     panel 16 for you.

[02:11:07:49]
LMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[02:11:07:51]
CC:  Okay. On row 1 under FLIGHT DISPLAYS, SYSTEMS
     ENGINEER's CROSSPOINTER, OPEN. Under [glossary:RCS] B - -

[02:11:08:00]
LMP: It's OPEN.

[02:11:08:01]
CC:  Open the TEMP/PRESS DISPLAY-FLAGS and PQGS/DISPLAYS.

_page : 208
_tape : Tape 40/9
LMP: Okay. They're both OPEN.

[02:11:08:12]
CC:  Okay, Fred. On row 3 under COMM, open DISPLAYS
     and under [glossary:ECS], open DISPLAYS.

[02:11:08:25]
LMP: Okay. COMM DISPLAYS, [glossary:ECS] DISPLAYS, both OPEN.

[02:11:08:28]
CC:  Okay. And two more. In row 4 under HEATERS,
     open DISPLAYS and under [glossary:EPS], open DISPLAYS.

[02:11:08:40]
LMP: Okay. HEATERS DISPLAY, [glossary:EPS] DISPLAY OPEN. And
     I've long since had all the lights off, floods,
     et cetera.

[02:11:08:55]
CDR: Where are those bags? Where are those bags for
     weighing water in the [glossary:PLSS]?

[02:11:09:02]
LMP: Why?

[02:11:09:03]
CDR: We're going to fill up command module water.
     We'll ...

[02:11:09:09]
LMP: Hell, do you need a QD ... Jim. No way to get
     ours in there. I don't think.

[02:11:09:37]
LMP: Hey, Jim.

[02:11:09:44]
CDR: I wonder if one of our water ... jet is. Okay,
     let's control - What else can we fill up there?

[02:11:10:00]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[02:11:10:02]
LMP: We're not - we're not going to - -

[02:11:10:03]
CC:  We're not going to be able to up link your time
     because of the [glossary:IU], and we have a frequency problem
     there. But what I'd like to do is give you a time
     to set up on your mission timer and give you a mark
     and then you can put it into the [glossary:DSKY] from there.
     Over.

[02:11:10:25]
CDR: Okay. Stand by.

[02:11:10:27]
LMP: Wait a minute. Why do we need a mission timer
     right now, anyway? I mean, that bad, they'd
     tell us.

[02:11:10:32]
CDR: Well, I'd rather have a timer going so that we -
     what are we going to put in the [glossary:DSKY]? Should we
     shut down the mission timer?

[02:11:10:37]
_page : 209
_tape : Tape 40/10
LMP: Is that what you want to do?

[02:11:10:38]
CDR: Yes. Hey, OMNI.

[02:11:10:43]
LMP: Great.

[02:11:10:47]
CDR: Switch them. Okay. Let's fire on the mission
     timer.

[02:11:10:59]
CC:  Aquarius, we need FORWARD OMNI.

[02:11:11:05]
CDR: FORWARD OMNI.

[02:11:11:07]
LMP: Say again, Jack.

[02:11:11:09]
CDR: FORWARD OMNI.

[02:11:11:11]
LMP: I am. Okay, Houston. If that call was an OMNI
     switch, I'm in FORWARD now.

[02:11:11:28]
CDR: Okay, Fred-o, how do I get the mission timer up?
     I got the mission timer cranked in.

[02:11:11:34]
LMP: You got it on?

[02:11:11:35]
CDR: I got the mission timer circuit breaker in.

[02:11:11:38]
LMP: Okay. We're going to probably need NUMERICS
     LIGHTING. There you go. You got it.

[02:11:11:47]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. I think we've got a better
     way of getting your mission time up.

[02:11:11:56]
CDR: Go ahead with it.

[02:11:11:59]
CC:  Okay. We can do a [glossary:VERB 55], ENTER, and then put
     an R<sub>1</sub>, minus 00088. In R<sub>2</sub>, minus 00059; R<sub>3</sub>
     minus 03274.

[02:11:12:36]
CMP: God damn. I wish you'd get to something I know.

[02:11:12:41]
CDR: Well, as soon as we get over here, we'll stop it
     with the [glossary:TTCA].

[02:11:12:43]
CMP: Okay.

[02:11:12:46]
CC:  And, Aquarius; Houston. We've got you both on VOX.

[02:11:12:54]
_page : 210
_tape : Tape 40/11
LMP: Like to go what?

[02:11:12:56]
CDR: You want us on VOX, Jack?

[02:11:12:58]
CC:  We have you on VOX. We're reading you loud and
     clear and the clock took good.

[02:11:13:17]
LMP: Okay. Looks like we're on the FDA route there,
     Jack.

[02:11:13:39]
LMP: Okay, Jack. How do you read me on NORMAL VOICE
     now?

[02:11:13:42]
CC:  Reading you 5 square, Fred.

[02:11:13:46]
LMP: Okay.

[02:11:14:12]
CC:  And, Aquarius, we're ready for a [glossary:VERB 74] when you
     can give it to us.

[02:11:14:23]
LMP: You got it.

[02:11:14:25]
CC:  Okay. And one other thing we noticed. When you
     pressurized the [glossary:RCS], we got an increase in pressure in the ascent tanks, and so we want to have
     you verify that the ascent feeds are closed. In
     order to do that, on panel 11, close the ASCENT
     FEED 1 and 2 circuit breakers on - and cycle the
     Parker valves, and then open the ASCENT FEED
     circuit breakers on panel 11.

[02:11:15:08]
CDR: Completed, Houston.

[02:11:15:10]
CC:  Okay, Jim. Thank you.

[02:11:17:53]
LMP: And, Jack, Aquarius. What kind of return time
     is this maneuver given?

[02:11:18:02]
CC:  That puts you back in the water at 133 hours.

[02:11:18:11]
LMP: 133, hey.

[02:11:18:13]
CC:  Affirm.

[02:11:18:24]
CC:  And that's an Atlantic landing site.

[02:11:18:31]
LMP: Atlantic landing?

[02:11:18:36]
CC:  Affirmative. That's the pad that we've given you,
     but we may change our mind later on. We want you
     to have this info for now. And that's a minimum - -

[02:11:18:47]
_page : 211
_tape : Tape 40/12
LMP: Okay.

[02:11:18:48]
CC:  - - minimum time return.

[02:11:20:09]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We've got to change the
     [glossary:REFSMMAT] to the one to which you're alined. So
     we'd like to have [glossary:P00] and DATA and we'll ship
     that up to you.

[02:11:20:21]
CDR: Roger.

[02:11:20:30]
LMP: Okay, you got it, Jack.

[02:11:20:34]
CC:  Roger. Coming up.

[02:11:21:22]
CC:  Aquarius, could you give us DATA please?

[02:11:21:32]
CDR: Okay, Jack, you got it.

[02:11:21:33]
LMP: - - the updata link, the DUA breaker may not be
     in, Jack.

[02:11:21:44]
CC:  Okay, Fred, and close the DUA breaker.

[02:11:21:51]
CDR: It's in now, Jack.

[02:11:21:54]
CC:  Okay, Jim, and it's coming up now. Thank you.

[02:11:28:03]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We're finished with the uplink.
     The computer's yours. We'd like to power down
     the DUA, so pull the DUA circuit breaker please.

[02:11:28:14]
LMP: Okay. Updata link breaker's coming OPEN.

[02:11:36:25]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We'd like to have AFT OMNI,
     and we're going to lose contact with you for
     about a minute here while we try to establish
     tracking. And our latest data shows that your
     closest approach to the Moon is going to be
     60 miles perigee. Over.

[02:11:36:44]
LMP: Okay. Closest approach, 60 miles, and I'm sitting
     on AFT OMNI now.

[02:11:36:50]
CC:  Roger. We'll probably be going off the air here
     in about a minute.

[02:11:41:12]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius. Over.

[02:11:41:14]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[02:11:41:19]
_page : 212

CDR: Okay. We're thinking about rigging up the urine
     dump to the side hatch. We're thinking about
     rigging up the urine dump to the side hatch and
     save urine heater power. What do you think?

[02:11:41:36]
CC:  Stand by 1.

[02:11:41:42]
CDR: Better still so we won't freeze up our urine dump.

[02:11:41:48]
CC:  Roger. That sounds like a good plan, Jim. Why
     don't you go ahead with that one?

[02:11:42:59]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. And down here we're getting regrouped, trying to work on your control modes and
     trying to set up something for [glossary:PTC] and taking a
     look at consumables as opposed to flight plan,
     and so forth, and as soon as we get all that information, we'll pass it up to you. We also have
     the 14 backup crew over in the simulators looking
     at dock burns and also trying to see what kind of
     alinement procedures they can come up with for
     looking at stars out the window. So if you ever
     are able to see any stars out there and think you
     can do an alinement out the window, why let us
     know.

[02:11:43:40]
CDR: Okay. Jack, right now we're not able to. The
     sunlight's reflecting off the thrusters and whatever debris came away at the time of the mishap
     is still with us, such that the stars are hard
     to find, and why - what respect do you want us to
     do the stars out the window - just to check the
     LMS run, is that correct?

[02:11:44:04]
CC:  That's affirmative. We'd like to correlate the
     information we get with your's, so that if we can
     use it to update the platform, we can. What we're
     really trying to do, Jim, is see if we can do a
     [glossary:COAS] aline so we can power down the platform.

[02:11:45:23]
CDR: That is Aquarius. We're getting an awful lot of
     static on the uplink now, and we're not reading
     you at all.

[02:11:45:39]
CDR: I have good signal strength and I'm on AFT OMNI.

[02:11:45:51]
CC:  How do you read now, Aquarius?

[02:11:47:06]
CC:  Hey, Jim, do you suppose that you could orient
     the [glossary:LM] so that the service module would be between you and the Sun? I believe you could see -
     recognize constellations out your front windows
     then.

[02:11:47:47]

[02:11:48:15]
CDR: Okay, Jack. How do you read now?

[02:11:48:17]
CC:  Okay. Hearing you 5 square now, Jim. And the
     question we have, is there some way you can orient
     the spacecraft so that the service module is between the [glossary:LM] and the Sun so you can recognize
     constellations out the window? And secondly,
     can you see anything out the [glossary:AOT]?

[02:11:49:28]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?

[02:11:53:46]
CC:  Aquarius, how do you read me now?

[02:11:56:56]

[02:11:57:08]
CC:  Aquarius, request FORWARD OMNI, please.

[02:11:58:22]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Request FORWARD OMNI. How
     do you read?

[02:11:59:06]
LMP: Okay, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read?

[02:11:59:09]
CC:  Hello there, Aquarius. Loud and clear. How do
     you read me?

[02:11:59:14]
CDR: There's an awful lot of background - -

[02:11:59:16]
LMP: We get a lot of background static, Jack. You're
     down in the mud. You having a ground problem?

[02:11:59:23]
CC:  What we tried to do was to get the [glossary:IU] frequency
     shifted off a little bit so that we'd have less
     interference. I think it'll come up - What we
     want you to do is turn on your descent oxygen
     and turn off your ascent oxygen. Over. And request FORWARD OMNI.

[02:11:59:43]
LMP: You're unreadable, Jack. We've got our signal
     strength meter - right now it keeps wavering up
     and down, and the best I'm getting is about
     2.4 AGC.

[02:11:59:53]
CC:  Roger. Request FORWARD OMNI.

[02:11:59:58]
LMP: I am on FORWARD OMNI. I've been on FORWARD OMNI.

[02:12:00:43]

[02:12:01:58]
LMP: Okay. We're up to about 2.6 AGC now.

[02:12:02:03]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Radio check.

[02:12:02:10]
LMP: Okay. Every time you transmit, Jack, the AGC
     starts to drop off and the static level turns up.

[02:12:02:18]
CC:  Okay, Fred. You're loud and clear.

[02:12:02:24]
LMP: I wish you were.

[02:12:02:30]

CDR: Hello, Houston; Aquarius.

[02:12:04:08]
CC:  Hello there, Aquarius. How do you read me now?

[02:12:04:23]
CDR: Hello, Houston. Aquarius.

[02:12:04:26]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Go.

[02:12:04:30]
CDR: Okay. That's the first clear word we heard from
     you, Jack. Do you think it could be my pitch
     attitude that's breaking up your incoming? I
     guess you've been hearing us.

[02:12:04:42]
CC:  We have been hearing you, and the problem is on
     the ground. I hope we have it corrected now.

[02:12:04:51]
CDR: Okay. That sounds good.

[02:12:04:53]
CC:  We're considering powering down the [glossary:PGNS] but we
     want to know what capability you have to do a
     coarse and fine aline. We read your conversation
     about being unable to see out the window very
     good. How about out the [glossary:AOT]?

[02:12:05:26]
LMP: He's looking now.

[02:12:05:29]
CC:  Okay. And the other thing we thought you might
     try is to put the service module between you and
     the Sun and then to see if you can see anything
     out the window in that attitude.

[02:12:05:48]
CC:  The reason that we think that that would work
     is that it worked on Apollo 10. It made the
     constellations all recognizable when we put the
     the service module - in our case a [glossary:LM], between
     us and the Sun.

CC:  Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?

[02:12:22:46]
LMP: Hello, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read?

[02:12:22:48]
CC:  Hello, there, Aquarius. Loud and clear. How
     me, now?

[02:12:22:54]
CDR: Okay, we're reading you loud and clear, Jack.
     I hope it stays this time.

[02:12:22:58]
CC:  Okay. We'd like to brief you on what our plan
     is. We're, at this time, water critical in the
     [glossary:LM]. So we'd like to use as little as possible.
     To do this, we're going to plan to make a free-return maneuver of 16 feet per second at 61 hours,
     which is 37 minutes from now. Then we're going
     to power down the [glossary:PGNS], and then we'll - at
     79 hours, we'll go ahead and make another abort
     maneuver to kick what we got. But we'd like to
     get that [glossary:PGNS] powered down as soon as possible.
     That would be after the midcourse and - so how
     do you feel about making a 16-foot-per-second
     burn in 37 minutes?

[02:12:23:49]
CDR: Well, we'll give it a try, Jack, if that's all
     we've got. That's a 16-foot-per-second [glossary:DPS] burn
     in 37 minutes?

[02:12:23:57]
CC:  Roger. We're working up a pad for it, but we'd
     want to know what you think about doing it at
     that time.

[02:12:24:08]
CDR: Well, we'll do it. Could you give us a little
     bit more time?

[02:12:24:30]
CC:  Okay, Jim. We'd like to get a suggested time
     from you. We can figure out a free-return
     maneuver for any time you want to give us, so
     if you'll give us the time you'd like to shoot
     for, we'll figure out a pad.

[02:12:24:47]
CDR: Okay, that sounds good. I think if we have a
     little bit more time; we want to do it right.
     Stand by 1.

[02:12:25:04]
CDR: Let's shoot for an hour if we can, Jack. How's
     that.

[02:12:25:15]
_page : 217
_tape : Tape 41/2
CC:  Okay, Jim. How about 61 hours and 30 minutes?
     That's an hour and 5 from now.

[02:12:25:24]
CDR: Okay. We'll do it and we want to be sure we talk
     back and forth now to make sure we get this burn
     off right.

[02:12:25:31]
CC:  Affirm.

[02:12:25:35]
LMP: Okay, in the interim, Jack, I looked around again
     and I saw that we have a radar and a landing-radar heater breaker in. Can I pull those out?

[02:12:25:46]
CC:  Affirmative. Pull them both out.

[02:12:25:52]
CC:  And now we want to ask you a question about
     alinements, and so forth. We wanted to know if
     you can see any stars out of the [glossary:AOT]. We also
     wanted to know if you could use the service
     module to cast a shadow on the [glossary:LM] windows and
     then look out the windows to see stars for a
     PS1 [glossary:COAS] alinement.

[02:12:26:14]
CDR: Okay, in this attitude, Jack, that we're pitching
     around, I cannot use the [glossary:AOT] to see stars. We -
     we're just not able to see them at all. Now we
     may be able to maneuver off in yaw or - and/or
     roll and see stars. Right now, we haven't been
     able to. The [glossary:AOT] is useless. The command module
     structure is just radiating too much light into
     the - into the telescope.

[02:12:26:41]
CC:  Okay, and how about using the service module to
     cast a shadow on the commander's window? If you
     do that, can you see stars for a [glossary:COAS] alinement?

[02:12:26:55]
CDR: We could give that a try, Jack, although I don't
     know how successful it will be. We tried to do
     it - The light shines off our quads which makes
     it difficult to see stars. We do have the Earth
     and the Moon, if that can be of assistance.

[02:12:27:18]
LMP: Another problem - Right now, Jack, I'm looking
     out the right window and it's pretty dark out
     that window but there are about a thousand or
     so false stars out here from - left over from
     some of the debris. It's hard to discern what's
     real and not real.

[02:12:27:38]
_page : 218
_tape : 
CC:  Okay. That's good information and during the
     time that we see you're continuing to pitch, if
     you ever get in a position where you think the
     [glossary:AOT] might be of some use, we'd like you to
     periodically look out of it and see if you can
     see some stars that would enable us to get a [glossary:P52].

[02:12:27:59]
CDR: Okay, will do. And also, let me ask you a question. In this configuration, docked, we have to
     use the [glossary:TTCA] to control pitch and roll. And,
     just how much can we use that without really
     changing our trajectory? We only have 60 miles
     to play with.

[02:12:28:21]
CC:  Roger, we'll put that to them.

[02:12:28:45]
LMP: Okay, Jack, are you ready to go to work with me
     on the 2-hour [glossary:DPS] activation and contingency
     book, page 1?

[02:12:28:54]
CC:  Roger, we're ready to go.

[02:12:29:05]
LMP: Okay. Item one, we can - one through five, we
     can scratch off, as done. Is that correct?

[02:12:29:14]
CC:  Stand by 1, Fred.

[02:12:30:18]
CC:  Okay, Fred, let's go ahead. Step 1, page 1.
     Everybody's listening.

[02:12:30:28]
LMP: Okay, I've looked around, and I've essentially
     done steps 1 through 5 with the exception of
     floodlights and utility lights and I think we'll
     just do without those.

[02:12:30:40]
CC:  Roger. Your choice.

[02:12:30:47]
LMP: Okay, on [glossary:EPS] activation, we're through step -
     we're through that - bottom of that page. That's
     all done.

[02:12:30:58]
CC:  We concur, page 2.

[02:12:31:13]
LMP: Okay, in essence, we've circumvented step 4, and
     we're not sitting with all 4 aps - descent BATs
     on high-voltage taps, so I'll scratch off step 4.

[02:12:31:28]
CC:  Roger, and in step 5, we want to leave INVERTER 1
     circuit breaker OPEN.

[02:12:31:37]
_page : 219
_tape : Tape 41/4
LMP: Roger. In step 5, we'll leave INVERTER 1 CB
     OPEN.

[02:12:31:41]
CC:  Omit step 6.

[02:12:31:53]
LMP: Okay, for the time being, our mission timer is
     the computer so, mission timer activation scratch
     off.

[02:12:32:05]
CC:  Roger.

[02:12:32:09]
LMP: Okay. We've done the primary glycol loop
     activation.

[02:12:32:15]
CC:  We verify it.

[02:12:32:29]
CC:  Aquarius, we recommend you leave the caution and
     warning off on page 3.

[02:12:32:37]
LMP: Okay. I was going to say that next. Page 3,
     we'll just scratch item 1. And item 2, I've
     already got the [glossary:RCS] heaters on. And I don't
     know if I gave you the time or you got the time
     on the PRIMARY EVAP FLOW number 1, OPEN.

[02:12:33:04]
CC:  We got the time.

[02:12:33:10]
LMP: Okay. Let's go to the CB pages now.

[02:12:33:29]
CC:  Fred-o, did you close the engine control breaker
     in panel 11?

[02:12:33:38]
LMP: What control is that, Jack?

[02:12:33:40]
CC:  Did you close the S and C engine control breaker
     on panel 11? As we got step 1 there on page 3.

[02:12:33:49]
LMP: Okay. Okay, yes, the [glossary:EPS] DESCENT ECA CONTROL
     breaker is CLOSED on 11.

[02:12:34:00]
CC:  Roger, and how about the - on panel 11, S and C
     ENGINE CONTROL, CLOSED? AFT OMNI, Fred.

[02:12:34:16]
LMP: Okay. We're AFT OMNI, and we have the S and C
     ENGINE CONTROL breaker CLOSED.

[02:12:34:24]
CC:  Roger. Let's go on with the circuit breaker
     panel checkout.

[02:12:34:34]
_page : 220
_tape : Tape 41/5
LMP: Okay. I'll just give you - I think it'll be
     easier to give you what I got in. Okay, in the
     top row on 11, we have the four AC BUS TIE
     breakers IN and the AC BUS VOLTS breaker IN,
     and that's it. Second row, we have the four TCA
     breakers IN. We have the GASTA under FLIGHT
     DISPLAYS and COMMANDER's [glossary:FDAI]. And likewise under
     AC BUS A, we have a GASTA and a COMMANDER [glossary:FDAI]
     breaker IN. That's it. On row 3, we have a
     SIGNAL CONDITIONER 1. We have the ATCA (PGNS).
     We have the ENGINE CONTROL breaker, ATTITUDE
     DIRECT CONTROL breaker, and the - under LIGHTING,
     ANUN/DOCK/COMPONENT breaker IN. And one other,
     ED LOGIC POWER A - ED LOGIC POWER A is also IN.

[02:12:35:41]
CC:  Copy.

[02:12:35:45]
LMP: Okay, under the fourth - fourth row, we got all
     the QUAD HEATER breakers IN, SUIT FAN 1. Under
     [glossary:ECS], GLYCOL 1 and 2; and under COMM, we have
     COMMANDER AUDIO IN, and [glossary:PGNS]s [glossary:LGC]/[glossary:DSKY], [glossary:IMU]
     STANDBY, [glossary:IMU] OPERATE, and that's it. Okay, in
     the bottom row, [glossary:EPS], we have the BAT FEED TIE
     both IN, and we have the CROSS TIE BALANCE LOADS
     IN, the X LUNAR BUS TIE, DESCENT ECA CONTROL,
     DESCENT ECA, and the DC BUS VOLTs breaker.

[02:12:36:38]
CC:  Roger. We copy. - -

[02:12:36:39]
CMP: That completes it for panel 11. Okay. Stand by.
     Okay.

[02:12:36:54]
LMP: As I see it, some of the short ones are - we need
     the DECA GIMBAL in sooner or later.

[02:12:37:00]
CC:  That's affirmed. Close the DECA GIMBAL.

[02:12:37:01]
LMP: And probably - Okay, DECA GIMBAL, and sooner or
     later, we're going to need DECA POWER, I guess,
     also.

[02:12:37:15]
CC:  All right, DECA POWER will come up later in the
     procedure, Fred-o.

[02:12:37:21]
LMP: Okay.

[02:12:38:41]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. On your circuit breaker
     checklist, on panel 11 and 16, we want you to
     configure the panels as outlined in the checklist.

[02:12:38:57]
_page : 221
_tape : Tape 41/6
LMP: Okay. You want us to configure as per checklist.
     Okay. We'll do that.

[02:12:39:03]
CC:  That's right. Close the black ones and open the
     white ones.

[02:12:39:12]
LMP: Yes. I think we can manage that.

[02:12:39:19]
CDR: With the activation power up, we're starting
     right now.

[02:12:40:12]
CDR: Houston, we might as well leave our [glossary:RCS] TCAs IN,
     right?

[02:12:40:23]
CC:  Affirmative, Jim. Leave your [glossary:RCS] TCAs in - -

[02:12:40:26]
LMP: Check that - -

[02:12:40:27]
CC:  - - on panel 11.

[02:12:40:30]
LMP: - - Yes. I used my Pentel pen and made those
     white ones black ones.

[02:12:40:35]
CC:  Roger. Same on 16, Fred.

[02:12:40:40]
LMP: Roger.

[02:12:40:46]
CDR: And you might look there, Houston, to see what
     circuit breakers aren't required, like the tape
     recorder.

[02:12:40:52]
CC:  We're looking.

[02:12:41:41]
CC:  Okay, Jim. On panel 11 over there, you can also
     leave open the RENDEZVOUS HEATER breaker and the
     LANDING RADAR HEATER breaker, in addition to the
     tape recorder.

[02:12:41:55]
CDR: They're out.

[02:12:42:04]
LMP: I'm leaving a few in, Jack, too, like the SUIT
     FAN 1 is still IN, [glossary:RCS] SYSTEM is still IN, the
     TCAs. ATTITUDE DIRECT CONTROL is IN.

[02:12:42:18]
CC:  Roger.

[02:12:42:33]
CDR: How about if I leave the VHF A and B OFF?

[02:12:42:41]
CC:  Switch to FORWARD OMNI.

[02:12:42:53]
_page : 222
_tape : Tape 41/7
CC:  Okay. We can leave the VHF powered down, too.

[02:12:43:01]
CDR: And, do you want the SECONDARY S-BAND?

[02:12:43:04]
CC:  Negative on SECONDARY S-BAND. Leave them open.

[02:12:43:13]
CDR: UP DATA LINK is IN. Do you want that in or out?

[02:12:43:21]
CC:  Leave the UP DATA LINK open. We'll call for it
     when we want you to put it in.

[02:12:44:36]
LMP: Okay, Jack, on panel 11 on the top row, do you
     really want the PROPULSION PQGS and ASCENT HELIUM
     REGs in?

[02:12:44:54]
LMP: And, also the SYSTEM ENGINEER X- POINTER breaker.

[02:12:44:59]
CC:  Roger. Negative on the PQGS. Negative on the
     ASCENT HELIUM REG, and negative on the CROSS-POINTER.

[02:12:45:17]
LMP: Okay. On the second row, I'm going to leave the
     FLOODLIGHT breaker open.

[02:12:45:24]
CC:  Concur.

[02:12:45:31]
LMP: And we're again up to - Do you want the [glossary:CWEA]
     enabled?

[02:12:45:39]
CC:  Negative on the [glossary:CWEA].

[02:12:45:44]
LMP: Okay.

[02:12:46:02]
LMP: Okay. Since we're - are we going to power up
     the [glossary:AGS] or should I concern myself with the ATCA
     breaker?

[02:12:46:14]
CC:  Negative on the [glossary:AGS]. However, Fred, we need the
     ATCA breaker in.

[02:12:46:28]
LMP: Okay. ATCA breakers IN. Yes. I guess for the
     backup power supply. Hey, how about ATCA [glossary:AGS].

[02:12:46:43]
CC:  Negative on ATCA [glossary:AGS].

[02:12:47:05]
LMP: And I'm leaving the SUIT FLOW CONTROL breaker
     open.

[02:12:47:20]
CC:  Let's close the SUIT FLOW CONTROL breaker - -

[02:12:47:22]
_page : 223
_tape : Tape 41/8
CDR: And, now ...

[02:12:47:23]
CC:  - - so it doesn't take any current.

[02:12:47:30]
LMP: Okay. Without suits, it doesn't do us much good
     either though.

[02:12:47:52]
LMP: Okay. And are we going to continue to be able
     to operate off the OMNIs, Jack. So can I leave
     the S-band antenna powered down?

[02:12:48:18]
CC:  Okay, Fred-o. We don't plan to use the steerable
     antenna, although we want to leave the heaters on.
     So it looks you ought to open up COMM S-BAND
     ANTENNA, but leave S-BAND ANTENNA HEATERS closed.

[02:12:48:33]
LMP: Roger. COMM S-BAND is OPEN, S-BAND HEATER breaker
     is still CLOSED.

[02:12:49:26]
LMP: And, on the bottom row, Jack, I'm going to leave
     the HEATER DISPLAY breaker out, which we had
     pulled before, and [glossary:EPS] DISPLAY. But I question,
     do we want the ASCENT ECA breaker in, as
     prescribed?

[02:12:49:47]
CC:  Stand by. That's a negative on the ASCENT ECA
     breaker. Leave it open.

[02:12:50:02]
CC:  And, Aquarius, we need [glossary:P00] and DATA - -

[02:12:50:04]
CDR: And that's a - -

[02:12:50:05]
CC:  - - and we'll give you state vector and target
     load.

[02:12:50:12]
LMP: Okay. We need the UP LINK breaker in then now.

[02:12:50:17]
CC:  That's affirmative.

[02:12:50:23]
CDR: Okay. And, Jack, will you give us that - how
     about the [glossary:ORDEAL] breaker? Can I pull that?
     We don't need that, do we?

[02:12:50:32]
CC: Negative on the [glossary:ORDEAL]. Leave it open.

[02:12:50:48]
LMP: And how about the ASCENT ECA breaker on panel 11?
     Jim has it in over there.

[02:12:51:02]
CC:  And panel 11 ASCENT ECA can be open.

[02:12:51:07]
_page : 224
_tape : Tape 41/9
CDR: It's open.

[02:12:51:27]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. We're GO on the circuit breaker
     configuration as you have it now.

[02:12:51:36]
SC:  Roger.

[02:12:52:04]
CC:  And, Aquarius, tests in the simulator just showed
     that if you want to let the [glossary:PGNS] [glossary:DAP] hold your
     attitude for you, it will.

[02:12:52:16]
CDR: Okay, very well.

[02:12:52:30]
CDR: And, Jack, because it will take quite a while to
     get back to the attitude, I think we ought to
     think about going there very shortly.

[02:12:52:37]
CC:  Roger. I have a pad for you. I have a [glossary:P30]
     maneuver pad.

[02:12:52:48]
CDR: Roger. Stand by.

[02:12:52:53]
CDR: ... - -

[02:12:52:54]
LMP: Go right ahead, Jack.

[02:12:52:58]
CC:  Okay. We want you to hold your maneuver until
     we finish making the load. We haven't completed
     it yet. Are you ready to copy [glossary:P30] maneuver pad?

[02:12:53:07]
CDR: That's affirm.

[02:12:53:09]
CC:  Okay. Here we go. The purpose is midcourse
     correction for free return. [glossary:NOUN 33]: [time:02:13:29:42|061:29:42.84];
     minus 0021.3, plus 0004.1, minus 0031.2; HA and
     HP are NA; DELTA-V 0038.0; 031, 120, 298,
     minus 00213, plus 00041, minus 00312; [glossary:COAS] NA.
     And I have your [glossary:LM] GDA angles. Pitch 5.86,
     roll 6.75. Your [glossary:DPS] throttling, 5 seconds at
     10 percent, burn the rest at 40 percent. Your
     ullage will be two jets for 10 seconds.

[02:12:54:57]
LMP: Okay, Jack, we have a [glossary:P30] maneuver pad, a midcourse for free return. [glossary:NOUN 33]: [time:02:13:29:42|061:29:42.84];
     minus 0021.3, plus 004.1, minus 0031.2; HA and
     HP N/A; DELTA-V<sub>R</sub> 0038.0; 031, 120, 298;
     minus 00213, plus 00041, minus 00312. [glossary:COAS] N/A;
     GDA angles; pitch 5.86, roll 6.75; [glossary:DPS] throttle
     5 seconds at 10 percent; burn the rest at 40 percent. And we need a two-jet, 10-second ullage.

[02:12:56:02]
_page : 225
_tape : Tape 41/10
CC:  That's a good readback, Fred. I'd like to verify,
     however, in [glossary:NOUN 81], in V<sub>Y</sub>, it's plus three balls
     41.

[02:12:56:14]
LMP: Okay. [glossary:NOUN 81], V<sub>Y</sub> is plus 0004.1.

[02:12:56:21]
CC:  Good readback. Let's press on with the checklist.

[02:12:56:27]
CDR: Okay. And, Jack, find out about using [glossary:TTCA] to
     maneuver with.

[02:12:56:32]
CC:  Okay. We're finished with the computer, it's
     yours, and we recommend using the [glossary:TTCA] to
     maneuver with.

[02:12:56:41]
CDR: Roger.

[02:12:56:43]
LMP: Okay, I'm back on the checklist, page 6. Jack,
     under [glossary:PGNS] turn-on and self-test. We've done
     everything except the self test here on this
     page. Do you want to do that at this time?

[02:12:57:28]
CC:  Okay. Aquarius, negative on the [glossary:PGNS] self test.

[02:12:57:37]
LMP: Okay. I'll scratch page 6 and on page 7, we're
     not going to activate the - or rather we had the
     S-band activated, [glossary:ECS] Activation I have all done.
     And, at the bottom of the page, the docked [glossary:IMU]
     coarse aline is done.

[02:12:58:03]
CC:  Roger.

[02:12:58:14]
LMP: We've - Okay, we've also completed, I guess in
     essence, all of page 8.

[02:12:58:22]
CC:  That's affirmative and page 9 to boot. Scratch
     VHF. We've done the T<sub>ephems</sub>.

[02:12:58:36]
LMP: Okay. You've updated it, that's right. We
     cranked in the time.

[02:12:58:52]
CDR: And, Houston, let's go to activation - or get
     into page 10 and see what we did there.

[02:12:58:58]
CC:  Okay. The only item on page 10 is to deploy the
     landing gear.

[02:12:59:06]
CDR: Okay, we'll do that now.

[02:13:00:10]
_page : 226
_tape : Tape 41/11
LMP: Okay. The landing gear are down and locked,
     Jack, and looking ahead now at page 11, we've
     done all of that.

[02:13:00:24]
CC:  We verify that. Page 12.

[02:13:00:31]
LMP: Okay, and I assume in amongst all those numbers
     you pumped up, we got a [glossary:REFSMMAT] and STATE
     VECTOR, is that correct?

[02:13:00:39]
CC:  That's affirmative. You've got that. So you
     can delete page 12.

[02:13:00:52]
LMP: Hey, on 13, you've read us up the fine aline
     angles and we've cranked those in.

[02:13:01:01]
CC:  Affirmative.

[02:13:01:08]
LMP: Okay, so now we're up to - we've got to do [glossary:DAP]
     set, the gimbal/throttle test.

[02:13:01:13]
CC:  That's - Okay, Aquarius. We recommend omitting
     the [glossary:DAP] set, gimbal/throttle test - just make
     sure the gim - DECA POWER and DECA GIMBAL circuit breakers are closed.

[02:13:01:33]
LMP: Okay, we're going to proceed now with the [glossary:DAP]
     set, gimbal/throttle test, is that correct? Or
     did you say delete it?

[02:13:01:40]
CC:  Aquarius, delete the [glossary:DAP] set, gimbal/throttle
     test. Just ensure that the DECA POWER and the
     DECA GIMBAL are closed.

[02:13:01:49]
CDR: Okay. Houston, DECA POWER is OPEN at this time.
     Do you want me to close it?

[02:13:01:54]
CC:  Affirmative, Jim. Close the DECA POWER.

[02:13:02:00]
CDR: It's CLOSED. We deleted that.

[02:13:02:27]
LMP: Okay. Also out of that list, Jack, we need the
     COMMANDER's THROTTLE set to THROTTLE and MIN.

[02:13:02:58]
LMP: Houston, if I recall the launch set of the
     gimbals, the GDAs are not correct here, and where
     are we going to get those set for the burn?

[02:13:03:14]
CC:  Stand by 1.

[02:13:03:33]
_page : 227
_tape : Tape 41/12
CC:  Okay. Here's the word on the [glossary:DAP] set, gimbal/
     throttle test. Let's do step 1 and step 2, and
     that'll get our gimbal set.

[02:13:03:50]
LMP: Roger.

[02:13:04:20]
LMP: Okay, Jack, we're going to have to back up on
     this, if we're going to follow the procedure here,
     which has us go MODE CONTROL; [glossary:PGNS], AUTO, we're
     going to have to pull the TCA breakers to keep
     from firing jets.

[02:13:04:53]
CC:  Stand by, Fred.

[02:13:05:28]
CC:  Stand by on step 1, Fred. We're getting the
     word for you. How do you like this SIM?

[02:13:05:42]
CDR: It's a beauty.

[02:13:06:09]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius, we recommend you do the [glossary:DAP] set
     and gimbal/throttle test as per the checklist.
     Go [glossary:PGNS] AUTO and proceed.

[02:13:06:21]
CDR: Well, we're going to fire our thrusters as soon
     as we go to AUTO because we've got those thrusters
     in - the thruster circuit breakers. Do you want
     us to do that and stop?

[02:13:06:50]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius, we're recommending you go to
     AUTO. Let the thrusters fire and settle down
     and proceed with the test.

[02:13:07:06]
CDR: We're in [glossary:PGNS] AUTO.

[02:13:07:09]
CC:  Roger, your [glossary:DAP] is set, you're in wide deadband.
     That ought to do the trick.

[02:13:07:15]
CDR: Roger.

[02:13:07:19]
CC:  Okay, we're looking at it, Aquarius. We're
     ready to proceed with the test.

[02:13:07:26]
LMP: Okay, we're proceeding.

[02:13:07:52]
LMP: Okay, and Houston, you - you're looking at the
     weights now. Those are still good, right?

[02:13:08:01]
CC:  You're GO on the weights.

[02:13:09:05]
_page : 228
_tape : Tape 41/13
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We'd like you to recycle on
     the [glossary:DAP] load and change your [glossary:DAP] to 32021. Over.

[02:13:11:05]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. We're looking at your gimbal
     and we notice that we got a four-jet ullage
     loaded in the [glossary:DAP] and we gave you two jets on
     the pad. But, let's go with what we've got loaded.
     It'll be a four-jet ullage.

[02:13:11:18]
LMP: Okay.

[02:13:11:40]
LMP: Okay, Houston. How does the GDAs look now?

[02:13:11:45]
CC:  The GDAs are GO as they are. Press on.

[02:13:12:09]
CDR: Okay, Houston, we're going to do the [glossary:DPS]
     pressurization and checkout.

[02:13:12:16]
CC:  Stand by 1.

[02:13:12:34]
CC:  Okay, your gimbals are within 0.3 and we're ready
     for the [glossary:DPS] pressurization and checkout.

[02:13:13:33]
LMP: Okay, Houston, do you want to follow up on
     page 15 with [glossary:RCS] checkout? In essence, we've
     kind of already done that.

[02:13:13:47]
CC:  You're right, Aquarius. Let's delete the [glossary:RCS]
     checkout. And a [glossary:DPS] looks GO.

[02:13:15:43]
CDR: Houston, we're going to do a [glossary:PGNS] AUTO maneuver
     to the attitude.

[02:13:15:49]
CC:  Stand by on that. Aquarius, we recommend
     driving it around there manually with a [glossary:TTCA].

[02:13:15:58]
CDR: Okay, we'll have to use the [glossary:TTCA]. Roger.

[02:13:21:10]
CDR: We're going to AUTO now, Houston, to try to damp
     the rates. We're at the attitude.

[02:13:21:22]
CC:  Roger, Jim. We verify the attitude.

[02:13:21:27]
CDR: Roger.

[02:13:23:37]
LMP: And, Houston, we'd like to confirm, do you
     want the [glossary:VERB 65] ENTER in there?

[02:13:23:45]
CC:  Affirmative on the [glossary:VERB 65].

[02:13:23:49]
_page : 229
_tape : Tape 41/14
LMP: Okay.

[02:13:24:12]
LMP: Okay, Jack. I got another question on page 18.
     At 1 minute, I concur with MASTER ARM ON, but
     I wonder why I have to have the ABORT STAGE
     breaker in. We sure don't want any staging now.

[02:13:24:38]
CC:  Aquarius, delete the ABORT STAGE circuit breaker
     CLOSE. Leave it open.

[02:13:24:46]
LMP: Roger. Will delete.

[02:13:24:55]
LMP: Okay. Also, Jack, since we have four-jet ullage
     versus two, do you want - still want 10 seconds
     ullage or do you want 5 now?

[02:13:25:09]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius, we'll use automatic ullage.

[02:13:25:18]
LMP: Okay. We'll just let the 7-1/2-second AUTO
     ullage do it.

[02:13:25:23]
CC:  Roger, and we'd like to do this in manual throttle,
     so on page 17 about two-thirds of the way down,
     THROTTLE CONTROL, MANUAL, vice AUTO.

[02:13:25:35]
LMP: Okay. We're set to MANUAL.

[02:13:25:58]
CDR: What's the 203 ... ?

[02:13:26:05]
CC:  ENTER on the 203, Jim.

[02:13:26:11]
CDR: We've got 203 in the [glossary:DSKY] now and it looks as
     though it requires work, can we pass it?

[02:13:26:16]
CC:  Aquarius, ENTER on the 203.

[02:13:26:22]
CDR: Wait a minute.

[02:13:26:51]
CC:  Aquarius, we'd like to verify that your throttle
     is in the MIN position.

[02:13:26:58]
CDR: That's affirm.

[02:13:27:00]
CC:  And, in the event that you have to do a manual
     takeover, turn the ENGINE GIMBAL OFF, MODE CONTROL
     to ATTITUDE HOLD, and use the hand - use the [glossary:TTCA].

[02:13:27:16]
CDR: Roger.

[02:13:28:14]
LMP: Okay, 1 plus 30 to burn.

[02:13:28:20]
_page : 230
_tape : Tape 41/15
CC:  Roger.

[02:13:28:45]
LMP: Okay, MASTER ARM's ON; 1 minute.

[02:13:28:53]
CC:  Roger, Aquarius. You're GO for the burn.

[02:13:29:55]
CDR: 40 percent.

[02:13:30:04]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. You're looking good.

[02:13:30:25]
CDR: AUTO shutdown.

[02:13:30:40]
LMP: Okay. You're looking at 1685 now, Jack.

[02:13:30:46]
CC:  Okay. You're GO in the residuals, proceed.

[02:13:30:55]
LMP: Okay. When you say GO on the residuals, you
     mean don't trim them. Is that right?

[02:13:31:00]
CC:  That's affirmative. No trim required.

[02:13:31:06]
CDR: Roger.

[02:13:31:08]
LMP: Okay.

[02:13:32:17]
CC:  Aquarius, check your MASTER ARM OFF, please.

[02:13:32:44]
CDR: Okay, Houston. Burn's complete. Now we have to
     talk about powerdown, and what do you want us to
     do with the [glossary:PGNS]?

[02:13:32:52]
CC:  Roger. We're looking at that right now, and
     you'll be the first one to get the word.

[02:13:33:19]
CDR: And, Houston, it's doubtful right now whether
     we'll be able to see the stars in this configuration. The only way we could possibly get alinement is with the Earth and the terminator or the
     Moon and its terminator and I'd sure like to
     have you look at a powerdown - keeping the [glossary:PGNS]
     if at all possible.

[02:13:33:49]
CC:  Roger, Jim. We'll get the word for you.

[02:13:35:24]
CDR: And, Houston, we're in an ATT HOLD mode, can we
     turn off the buses?

[02:13:35:40]
CC:  Stand by on that one, Jim.

[02:13:38:13]
_page : 231
_tape : Tape 41/16
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. We're working on what's going
     to happen next. In the meantime, we'd like to
     take some high-power items off the line, so on
     panel 11, open DECA POWER, and open DECA GIMBAL.
     On 16, open the ATCA breaker.

[02:13:38:36]
LMP: Okay, on 11, we got DECA POWER, DECA GIMBAL, OPEN.
     On 16, we got the ATCA breaker OPEN.

[02:13:39:37]
CDR: And, Houston, while you're thinking, see if you
     can come up with a procedure of perhaps using
     the command module optics with manual drive to
     perhaps look for stars.

[02:13:39:51]
CC:  Roger.

[02:13:41:24]
CDR: And, Jack, Aquarius. While you're thinking -
     before we had our COMM problems, we were wanting
     to know what to - whether we should hook up the
     side hatch urine dump system. So we wouldn't
     freeze up the normal urine dump system.

[02:13:41:45]
CC:  Roger. We gave you a GO on that earlier. Sorry,
     you must have missed it. Use the side hatch for
     urine dump.

[02:13:41:54]
CDR: Okay.

[02:13:41:56]
CC:  And, how are the stars out the window now?

[02:13:42:13]
CDR: Well, I'll look again, Jack, but at this attitude,
     the Sun is reflecting off of - off of quad 4 so
     bright that it's ruining any night vision and
     we still got particles floating around us; I'll
     have to take a long look and see if I can see
     any star patterns.

[02:13:42:34]
CC:  Roger. And Aquarius, we're going to have to hand
     you over to a different site now, and we think
     maybe things will work better if this time we
     turn off the S-band transmitter/receiver, and
     bring it back up in 5 minutes. You copy?

[02:13:42:59]
CDR: Okay. Stand by 1.

[02:13:43:10]
CDR: Okay. I understand you want us to turn off the
     S-band transmitter/receiver and bring it up in
     5 minutes. Is that correct?

[02:13:43:15]
CC:  That's affirmative.

[02:13:43:20]
_page : 232
_tape : Tape 41/17
CDR: Tell us when.

[02:13:43:42]
CDR: And you want us to maintain attitude control.

[02:13:43:46]
CC:  Affirmative on the attitude control.

[02:13:43:48]
CDR: That's auto attitude control. Okay. You maintain auto attitude control.

[02:13:43:56]
LMP: Okay, Jack, I'm back on the line now. On the
     S-band, you want me to turn off the transmitter/
     receiver and the power amps are off for 5 minutes.
     Is that - when you give me the word - is that
     what you want?

[02:13:44:10]
CC:  Aquarius, leave the power amplifier the way it
     is. Turn the transmitter/receiver off for
     5 minutes. Now.

[02:13:44:19]
LMP: Okay. You tell me - you tell me when.

[02:13:44:22]
CC:  Okay. Turn it off now. See you in 5 minutes.

[02:13:44:26]
_extra : END OF TAPE
LMP: Okay. It's gone off. It's gone off for
     5 minutes.

[02:13:52:44]
_page : 233
_tape : Tape 42/1
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?

[02:13:52:52]
LMP: Okay. You're loud and clear there, Jack.

[02:13:52:54]
CC:  Roger. Same here. We're - We're still discussing
     the next move.

[02:13:53:04]
LMP: I figured it. Let's just make it a good one.

[02:13:53:18]
CC:  We're looking real close at water usage profiles,
     and right now things are kind of swinging toward
     leaving the [glossary:IMU] powered up and powering down the
     [glossary:LGC], but we'll have more word for you shortly.
     And we recommend for sleeping that you leave one
     guy on watch. We recommend you don't make any
     urine dumps if you can help it, because it'll
     make the debris problem worse than it is now.
     And we have some items that you might want to
     transfer to the [glossary:LM], some towels, some penlights,
     fecal bags, UTS. And do you have any more items
     that we can help you out with at the moment?

[02:13:54:17]
LMP: Okay. Stand by on your latter list there, Jack.
     I understand no urine dumps. I guess we'll work
     through the UCD and all the bags we got; and
     real quick there, can you give a [glossary:DAP] load that
     we want in here now to conserve the [glossary:RCS].

[02:13:55:21]
CC:  Okay. For attitude control coordinates, we're
     recommending manual control [glossary:VERB 76] and watch
     your middle gimbal angle. Your [glossary:DAP] load that you
     have now looks good.

[02:13:55:37]
LMP: Okay. It's ATT HOLD [glossary:VERB 76] for the guy on
     watch. And the [glossary:DAP] load we got right now is okay.

[02:13:58:17]
CC:  Aquarius, our decision for the time is to leave
     the [glossary:IMU] powered up, power down the [glossary:LGC], and power
     down other nonessential items. We'll be coming
     up with a more precise checklist as soon as we
     can get it. Over.

[02:13:58:36]
LMP: Okay. The decision is to keep the platform,
     power down the computer, and we'll be standing
     by for further word on the powerdown, Jack.

[02:13:58:47]
CC:  Roger.

[02:13:59:33]
_page : 234
_tape : Tape 42/2
CC:  And, Aquarius, for your information, we now have
     136-mile perigee. Confirmed by Doppler.

[02:13:59:47]
LMP: Okay. 136-mile perigee now. That's very nice.

[02:14:00:09]
LMP: Oh, wait a minute, Jack. Did you say pericynthion
     or perigee?

[02:14:00:13]
CC:  I meant pericynthion.

[02:14:00:18]
LMP: Ah. That's better.

[02:14:05:19]
CDR: And, Houston, we pulled out your UPDATA LINK
     circuit breaker, so if you want to update it for
     anything, let us know and we'll put it back in.

[02:14:05:27]
CC:  Roger, Jim. We will.

[02:14:09:41]
CC:  Aquarius, AFT OMNI, please.

[02:14:09:47]
CDR: AFT OMNI.

[02:14:14:26]
LMP: Houston, do you read Apollo 13?

[02:14:14:30]
CC:  This is Houston. Go ahead. Reading you weakly.

[02:14:14:36]
CDR: Okay, Jack. We don't want to bug you, but you
     ought to be thinking - or what your thoughts are
     concerning what the next burn will be. I got to
     figure out a watch schedule and the sleep schedule
     and just how we can meet the next maneuver.

[02:14:14:55]
CC:  Roger. We're getting you a flight plan update.
     We're still computing on your next burn, and we're
     getting ready to give you a procedure for
     powerdown.

[02:14:16:34]
CC:  Aquarius, one idea on managing the OMNI antennas.
     It might make it easier on everybody if we disabled
     the UPLINK SQUELCH and managed the antennas by
     switching when we hear the noise. Over.

[02:14:16:58]
CDR: Roger. Will do.

[02:14:26:07]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. Here's what we're going to do.
     We'd like you to point the [glossary:LM] X-axis either north
     or south. That's the positive X-axis. It appears
     to us that it would be closer to orient the [glossary:LM]
     plus X-axis toward the south. Do that with the
     [glossary:LGC] powered up using the [glossary:TTCA]. After that, we
     propose to power down the [glossary:LGC] to save some power.
     However, this means that we lose the use of the
     [glossary:TTCA], and we'll have to control the spacecraft
     with the hand controller in the DIRECT mode.
     Request your - your position on these two items.

[02:14:27:34]
_page : 235
_tape : Tape 42/3
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?

[02:14:27:45]
CDR: Okay, Jack. Understand. You want us to point
     the [glossary:LM] X - plus X-axis to the south using the
     [glossary:TTCA|TTCAs] with the [glossary:LGC] powered up. Then, by powering
     down the [glossary:LGC], we'll lose a [glossary:TTCA]. I wasn't too
     successful in controlling the spacecraft in attitude only, but I might be able to keep it out
     of gimbal lock.

[02:14:28:14]
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim. We'd keep your ball
     powered up and go to DIRECT on the hand controller.
     And maintain attitude in a DIRECT position.

[02:14:28:39]
CDR: Okay. Understand; and do you want some sort of
     a [glossary:PTC] mode, Jack?

[02:14:28:47]
CC:  Affirmative. We'll take whatever [glossary:PTC] mode you
     can set up, Jim.

[02:14:28:54]
CDR: Okay. And since you know our approximate attitude,
     how about just getting me something to find you
     on the [glossary:DSKY] for a southerly plus X-direction.

[02:14:29:04]
CC:  Roger. Stand by 1.

[02:14:30:35]
CDR: And one other question, Houston. When you say
     power down the [glossary:DSKY] or the [glossary:LGC], do you mean going
     into 06 or multiple circuit breaker?

[02:14:30:48]
CC:  Stand by on powering down the [glossary:DSKY], Jim. We'll
     give you the procedure for that. The procedure
     that we - -

[02:14:30:57]
CDR: Okay.

[02:14:30:58]
CC:  - - the procedure that we have is listed in several
     places. It's in the Contingency checklist under
     "Power down" on page 1, second paragraph.

[02:14:31:21]
CC:  And we'll give you that word when we want you to
     do that. That's [glossary:LGC] only, not to power down the
     [glossary:IMU]. But we'd like to have you hold off on that
     until we send you the word. Over.

[02:14:31:38]
_page : 236
_tape : Tape 42/4
CDR: Understand.

[02:14:33:57]
CC:  And, Aquarius, while we're working on this, we
     have a proposed flight plan update for your working and resting cycles. And - You ready to copy?

[02:14:34:14]
LMP: Okay. Do you want me to write this in the flight
     plan, per se, Jack?

[02:14:34:19]
CC:  You can probably write it on a piece of scratch
     paper. This is pretty easy.

[02:14:34:31]
LMP: Okay. Go ahead. We got a lot of scratch paper.

[02:14:34:39]
CC:  Okay. We're suggesting that the LMP rest while
     the CMP and CDR are awake. LMP ought to hit the
     sack at about 63 hours, coming up in 25 minutes.
     And you get to rest for 6 hours. You get up at
     69 hours. At 70 hours, the commander and the
     command module pilot sleep for 6 hours until
     76 hours. Around 70 - 76-1/2 to 77 hours, we'll
     do a [glossary:P51] and a 52. At 78:30, we'll load [glossary:P30] and
     aline [glossary:AGS] to [glossary:PGNS]. Our ignition time for a second
     burn will be, presently, [time:03:07:25:26|79:25:26.5], and we'll
     have a pad for you shortly. We suggest that all
     of you eat after the burn. That'll be 81 to
     82 hours. Let the CMP and CDR eat while you are
     sleeping. And that you grab a bite as soon as
     you can. Over.

[02:14:37:05]
LMP: Okay, Jack. As I read that, the LMP is to go to
     sleep at [time:02:15:00:00|63:00] for about 6 hours. During that
     period, the CDR and CMP should try to get a bite
     to eat. I'm to awake at 69 hours. CDR and CMP
     sleep at 70 hours, and they are to awake at
     76 hours. And we should plan on doing our [glossary:P51],
     [glossary:P52] at 76 hours or [time:03:04:30:00|76:30]. At 78:30, we're going
     to load a [glossary:P30] and aline [glossary:AGS] to [glossary:PGNS]. Second
     maneuver is to take place at [time:03:07:25:26|79:25:26.5] for
     ignition time. Then we're all to eat at 81 to
     82 hours.

[02:14:38:05]
CC:  Okay. With a minor modification, your [glossary:P51], [glossary:P52]
     will be about 77 hours, and that's the period of
     darkness. And the commander and the CMP ought to
     eat around 68 to 69 hours, and you should eat
     between 69 to 70 hours just after you get up. We
     have left an hour in there where everybody is
     awake together to talk things over. Go ahead.

[02:14:38:44]
_page : 237
_tape : Tape 42/5
LMP: Okay. I'll eat after I wake up between 69 and 70.

[02:14:38:53]
CC:  All right we have additional - -

[02:14:38:55]
LMP: - - and I've got the correction to P - -

[02:14:38:59]
CC:  Go ahead, Fred.

[02:14:39:00]
LMP: Yes. We got the word the [glossary:P51], [glossary:P52] is going to be
     done around 77 hours, while we're in darkness.

[02:14:39:11]
CC:  That's affirmative. And we have a work-rest cycle
     laid out for further on, which we can relay to you
     later.

[02:14:39:22]
LMP: Okay.

[02:14:39:40]
CDR: Okay. And, Houston, you have advice on what
     attitude you want me to go to.

[02:14:39:50]
CC:  Okay. That'll be the next bit of information.
     I'll get that for you, Jim.

[02:14:39:56]
CDR: Okay.

[02:14:41:43]
CC:  And, Aquarius, just to get you thinking in that
     direction, we've run a fairly thorough analysis,
     and we've found out that it's going to be cheaper
     to keep the [glossary:LGC] and the [glossary:DSKY] up and turn the
     inverter and the ball off. It's going to save us
     1 amp and also some water, so it looks like what
     we're going to do. And we'll have to monitor the
     middle gimbal angle. And we'll get the procedure
     on that, and it'll also be an easier control mode
     where we'll be able to use the [glossary:TTCA] through the -
     through the [glossary:DAP].

[02:14:42:17]
CDR: That sounds great, Jack.

[02:14:47:28]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We've got a procedure for you.
     Ready to copy?

[02:14:47:40]
CDR: Ready to copy.

[02:14:47:42]
CC:  Okay. It's pretty easy. We see you've already
     got [glossary:VERB 16] [glossary:NOUN 20] called up there and so we
     want you to, in maneuver and [glossary:PGNS] ATTITUDE HOLD,
     use the [glossary:TTCA]. We want you to, on the commander's
     ball, pitch to 267.5 and yaw to minus 4.5. And
     when you do this in [glossary:VERB 16] [glossary:NOUN 20], on the [glossary:DSKY],
     you ought to read plus 00120, plus 26750, and
     plus 00450. Go ahead.

[02:14:48:34]
_page : 238
_tape : Tape 42/6
LMP: Okay. We're to drive the commander's ball to a
     pitch of 267.5, yaw minus 4.5. And we should have
     in 16 20 at that time, plus 00120, plus 26750,
     plus 00450.

[02:14:48:56]
CC:  That's a good readback. We'll watch the maneuver.

[02:14:56:25]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[02:14:56:27]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[02:14:56:31]
CDR: Roger. You didn't mention roll on the ball. Do
     you want roll zero?

[02:14:56:42]
CC:  The roll ought to be plus 1.2, Jim.

[02:14:56:49]
CDR: Roger.

[02:15:03:41]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[02:15:03:44]
CC:  Go ahead, Jim.

[02:15:03:48]
CDR: Okay. We're just about there in pitch and in ...
     middle gimbal angle, but that other gimbal angle
     didn't look like it pulled the right way. I
     tried both methods.

[02:15:04:02]
CC:  Yes. I been looking at that, too, and we're asking why, and we'll get an answer for you.

[02:15:04:20]
LMP: Yes. Houston, I wonder if you're accounting for
     being a bit off the bellyband here, and I've gone
     through GASTA.

[02:15:04:38]
CC:  And, Fred-o, I know you're supposed to start
     sleeping here pretty soon, but we got a new PC
     plus 2 pad, [glossary:P30] maneuver pad for you.

[02:15:04:56]
CDR: Stand by.

[02:15:05:32]
LMP: Okay. Go ahead, Jack.

[02:15:05:35]
CC:  Okay, Fred. [glossary:P30] maneuver purpose is PC plus 2,
     [glossary:DPS] to this time, we're going to the MPL. And
     [glossary:NOUN 33], 079, 27, 4013, plus 08144, minus 00443,
     minus 02226, apogee is N/A, perigee is plus 00205,
     08455, 420, 268, 261, plus 08155, minus 00443,
     minus 02187, [glossary:COAS] is N/A. Your GDA ought to be
     okay as it is from the last burn, but pitch ought
     to be at 5.85; in roll, it's 6.74. Your ullage
     will be two jets for 10 seconds. Your [glossary:DPS]
     throttle will be 10 percent for 5 seconds, 40 percent for 21 seconds, and the remainder at full
     throttle. And for your information, this will
     put you in the water at 142 plus 47. Over.

[02:15:07:46]
_page : 239
_tape : Tape 42/7
LMP: Okay. [glossary:DPS], pericynthion plus 2 into the MPL,
     079, 27, 4013, plus 08144, minus 00443, minus
     00226, N/A, plus 00205, 08455, 4 plus 20, 268,
     261, plus 08155, minus 00443, minus 021, 2187,
     N/A. GDA should be okay as is, which hopefully
     is pitch 5.85, yaw 6.74. Two-jet ullage for
     10 seconds, the [glossary:DPS] throttle 10 percent for
     5 seconds, 40 percent for 21 seconds, 100 percent for the rest of the burn. And this should
     put us into the water at 142 plus 47.

[02:15:09:03]
CC:  Okay, Fred. I have a correction in [glossary:NOUN 81].
     DELTA-V<sub>Z</sub> is minus 02226. Read back.

[02:15:09:22]
LMP: Okay. DELTA-V<sub>Z</sub> in [glossary:NOUN 81] is minus 02226.

[02:15:09:28]
CC:  Okay. Good readback.

[02:15:09:41]
LMP: Somehow that didn't add up with the DELTA-V<sub>X</sub> to
     give a DELTA-V<sub>R</sub> of that magnitude. It seems like
     it'd been bigger.

[02:15:09:52]
CC:  Okay. We'll take another look at it, Fred.

[02:15:12:29]
CDR: Okay, Houston. I'm not having too much luck holding this particular attitude.

[02:15:12:42]
CC:  Okay, Jim. Stand by 1.

[02:15:14:17]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. When you get her pretty much in
     attitude there, and it looks like you're as close
     as we need to be, we'd like to try a control mode
     and see if it will work; sort of a semi-[glossary:PTC]. We'll
     leave the ball powered up for this, and if this
     doesn't work, why, we'll have to revert to
     ATTITUDE HOLD mode. But - Stand by 1, please.

[02:15:15:03]
CC:  We'd like you to think about this control mode,
     Jim, and see if you think it might work from
     what you know right now. We're a little skeptical, but we'd like to put it to you. So, once
     you get in a pretty good attitude, monitor in
     [glossary:VERB 16] [glossary:NOUN 20], go to [glossary:PGNS] MINIMUM IMPULSE,
     [glossary:VERB 76], as we have, and set up a yaw rate - yaw
     rate to the right. Monitor the middle gimbal on
     R<sub>3</sub> on the [glossary:DSKY] and see if she'll kind of stabilize
     out. If not, the only other suggestion we've got
     is to go to [glossary:PGNS] ATTITUDE HOLD. We'll keep the
     ball up until you make this evaluation.

[02:15:15:45]
_page : 240
_tape : Tape 42/8
CDR: Okay, Houston. You cut out, say again.

[02:15:15:51]
CC:  Okay. Where'd you lose me, Jim?

[02:15:15:56]
CDR: I lost you when you said try the control mode;
     you're a little skeptical.

[02:15:16:01]
CC:  Okay. From what you say, we have to be a little
     skeptical of this procedure, but we'd like to
     have you try it and have you evaluate it. You
     can monitor the middle gimbal on R<sub>3</sub>. Before we
     power down the ball, we want your evaluation.
     The next best choice is [glossary:PGNS] ATTITUDE HOLD. Over.

[02:15:16:24]
CDR: Okay. I'll try it.

[02:15:16:53]
CDR: Okay. Go ahead with the control mode procedure.

[02:15:17:30]
CDR: Hello, Houston; Aquarius.

[02:15:17:33]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[02:15:17:36]
CDR: Okay. I'm not ... you. I can monitor register 3.
     I can probably keep it out of ... - going into
     gimbal lock.

[02:15:17:49]
CC:  Roger. How are pitch and roll?

[02:15:18:40]
CDR: Okay. I think I can control the gimbal angles in
     16 20 with the compressors the way they are, but
     I'll have to try MINIMUM IMPULSE - just a minute.

[02:15:19:04]
CMP: Okay, Jack. I've a question - one more question
     about Odyssey.

[02:15:19:08]
_extra : END OF TAPE
CC:  Go ahead.

[02:15:19:14]
_page : 241
_tape : Tape 43/1
CMP: Okay, I still have the PYRO A sequence A and
     PYRO B sequence B circuit breakers in. Do you
     want those out?

[02:15:19:23]
CC:  Stand by 1.

[02:15:19:37]
CC:  Odyssey, Houston. The two circuit breakers
     you referred to, leave them in.

[02:15:19:45]
CMP: Okay. Copy. Leave them in.

[02:15:19:59]
CDR: Okay, Houston. I can control yaw in minimum
     impulse, but stand by on pitch.

[02:15:20:17]
CC:  And, Fred-o, the DELTA-V<sub>R</sub> resultant computes
     with the components.

[02:15:20:29]
CDR: Fred's off the COMM now, Jack.

[02:15:20:32]
CC:  Roger. Your PAD is good.

[02:15:20:35]
LMP: And, Jack, we didn't get that whole sentence
     there.

[02:15:20:39]
CC:  Okay. I said that the DELTA-V<sub>R</sub> that Fred
     questioned computes well with the component -
     its rms.

[02:15:20:49]
LMP: Okay. Copy.

[02:15:20:54]
CDR: Okay, now. Jack, let's go over this once more.
     You wanted me to try out control of the spacecraft in the PULSE mode. Is that correct?

[02:15:21:03]
CC:  That's affirmative. Set up a yaw rate and monitor the middle gimbal angle.

[02:15:21:16]
CDR: Okay. I can do that. I'm not too sure whether
     I can control roll or pitch in pulse, but I can
     control yaw in pulse - yaw in pulse on the ball.

[02:15:21:30]
CC:  Roger. And remember we're not going to have a
     ball there, so that we're going to be monitoring
     CDUs on the [glossary:DSKY], and if we get it off, it will
     be pretty hard to figure out where to fly back
     to; and, well, in addition, have to control the
     OMNIs while we're doing this.

[02:15:21:52]
_page : 242
_tape : Tape 43/2
CDR: Roger.

[02:15:22:06]
CDR: Without the ball, I still have use of the [glossary:TTCA]
     for control of the - angles.

[02:15:22:12]
CC:  Affirmative. You'll have the [glossary:TTCA] for pitch and
     roll.

[02:15:22:18]
CDR: Okay. I think I can do that without the ball,
     and if you just give me the [glossary:TTCA|TTCAs] I think I can
     control the spacecraft using 16 20.

[02:15:22:31]
CDR: I'm going to yaw right.

[02:15:22:49]
CDR: Okay, Jack. I am now - The REGISTER 1 is in the
     DECREASE mode.

[02:15:23:36]
CDR: And, Houston, do you see anything wrong with
     this spacecraft motion?

[02:15:23:46]
CC:  We have a data drop on right now, Jim; we'll
     look at it as soon as it comes up.

[02:15:24:52]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. We're going to dispense with
     this control mode. We'd like you to fly the
     machine back to the original attitude that you
     had, and we'll go [glossary:PGNS] ATTITUDE HOLD, and then
     we've got to get that ball off the line to save
     some power. And then, in order to keep even
     heating, every 15 or 30 minutes, we'll give you
     a call to give us 90 or 180 degrees of roll -
     of yaw.

[02:15:25:27]
CDR: Okay. You want me to go back to original attitude.
     I'll be going back to it now.

[02:15:28:36]
CDR: Okay, Houston; Aquarius. I'm flying it back over
     towards the initial angles you gave me of a pitch
     of 257. I'll get near the bellyband in roll and
     yaw; then I'll go to [glossary:PGNS] ATT HOLD.

[02:15:28:47]
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim. And then we're going to
     have you go through a powerdown procedure.

[02:15:28:56]
CDR: Okay.

[02:15:29:02]
CC:  And you'll need [glossary:VERB 77] with ATT HOLD when you get
     there.

[02:15:29:08]
CDR: Will do.

[02:15:31:48]
_page : 243
_tape : Tape 43/3
CDR: Okay, Jack. Have I gotten your 360 on yaw and
     roll? I'm going to go to ATT HOLD.

[02:15:31:56]
CC:  Roger. And then we want to get the ball part
     down.

[02:15:32:02]
CDR: Okay. Stand by.

[02:15:32:52]
CDR: Okay. I'm now in [glossary:PGNS] ATT HOLD. And are you
     reading my [glossary:DSKY] angles?

[02:15:32:58]
CC:  Roger. We see them.

[02:15:33:03]
CDR: Now, you want me to power down the ball, and
     if you'll give me the procedure for that, I'll
     do it right away.

[02:15:33:06]
CC:  Okay. We'll buy what you've got on the [glossary:DSKY]
     there, and we'd just like to go through an
     overall powerdown procedure, and in so doing
     we'll catch the ball and inverter and it will
     only take a few minutes. So are you ready to
     start on panel 11?

[02:15:33:23]
CDR: Roger. Jack will copy, and I'll do the work.

[02:15:33:27]
CC:  Okay. Panel 11, top row, open all the circuit
     breakers.

[02:15:33:35]
CDR: All circuit breakers on top row coming open.

[02:15:33:48]
CDR: They're all open, top row.

[02:15:33:50]
CC:  Okay. Second row, close the first six on the
     left through the ISOL VALVE and open all to the
     right of that.

[02:15:34:07]
CDR: Okay. First six on the left are closed - That's
     through the ISOL VALVE, but I opened up every
     one from there on.

[02:15:34:13]
CC:  Okay. Third row, open up the next five -
     correction - Open up the first five on the left,
     close [glossary:AOT] HEATER, close SIG CONDITIONER 1.
     Close ATTITUDE DIRECT, and open the rest on row
     three.

[02:15:34:46]
CDR: Do you want ATCA (PGNS) open?

[02:15:34:53]
_page : 244
_tape : Tape 43/4
CC: Leave ATCA (PGNS) closed; four breakers on the
     third row must be closed. [glossary:AOT] HEATER, SIG CONDITIONER 1, and ATCA (PGNS), ATTITUDE DIRECT
     CONTROL. Our mistake, good going.

[02:15:35:13]
CDR: Okay. I'm opening up ENGINE START OVERRIDE
     right now. And that row's taken care of.

[02:15:35:30]
CC:  Okay. On the fourth row. Open - From the left,
     open the first five - correction - Close the
     first five, and open CABIN FAN 1. Close the
     three GLYCOL PUMP circuit breakers; open all the
     COMM breakers, except for COMMANDER'S AUDIO;
     close it. All the [glossary:PGNS] breakers, open - correction - Open the first three [glossary:PGNS] breakers, close
     [glossary:LGC]/[glossary:DSKY], [glossary:IMU] STANDBY, [glossary:IMU] OPERATE.

[02:15:36:23]
CDR: That's complete, Jack.

[02:15:36:27]
CC:  Okay. And [glossary:EPS], close BAT FEED TIES, CROSSTIE
     BAL LOAD, and open the CROSS TIE BUS. Close the
     next three; open ASCENT ECA CONTROL, ASCENT ECA,
     and INVERTER 1. Close DC BUS VOLT. Go ahead.

[02:15:37:02]
CDR: That's complete, Jack. Panel 11 is configured.

[02:15:37:09]
CC:  Okay. Let's go over to panel 16, top row,
     and starting from the left - Open the first four.

[02:15:37:27]
CDR: Stand by, Jack.

[02:15:37:38]
CDR: Okay. Starting from the left, open the first
     four.

[02:15:37:43]
CC:  Okay. And close the ISOL VALVE, keep your TCA
     breakers closed, close the CROSSFEED, open the
     next two displays. Close the MAIN SOV and the
     PROPULSION breakers should all three be open.

[02:15:38:08]
CDR: Roger. The main valves are closed, and the
     DISPLAY ENGINE OVERRIDE LOGIC's coming open,
     and the PQGS and ASC He REG are open.

[02:15:38:18]
CC:  That's affirmative. The second row: they should
     all be open except for three breakers under instrumentation. Close SIG SENSOR, PCM/TE, and
     SIG CONDITIONER 2. Over.

[02:15:38:41]
CDR: Roger. Do you want SUIT FLOW CONTROL open?

[02:15:38:57]
CDR: ENGINE ARM coming open and ASA I guess will be
     open. Is that correct?

[02:15:39:01]
_page : 245
_tape : Tape 43/5
CC:  We just got a change on that. Let's keep the
     ASA closed.

[02:15:39:09]
CDR: How about SUIT FLOW CONTROL and ENGINE ARM?

[02:15:39:22]
CC:  Okay, Jim. SUIT FLOW CONTROL can be open, and
     ENGINE ARM - ENGINE ARM open.

[02:15:39:40]
CDR: Okay. Let's go to row 3.

[02:15:39:44]
CC:  Okay. Row 3 under COMM. Open DISPLAYS, close
     SE AUDIO, open VHF A TRANSMITTER and B RECEIVER,
     close the PRIMARY S-BAND circuit breakers, both
     of them. Open the S-BAND ANTENNA, PMP closed,
     TV open, and all the rest of them open under
     [glossary:ECS], except CO<sub>2</sub> SENSOR, closed.

[02:15:40:24]
CDR: Roger.

[02:15:40:31]
CC:  Okay. Under row 4: under HEATERS, your [glossary:RCS] QUAD
     heaters should - four of them - be closed, open
     DISPLAYS, open S-BAND ANTENNA, open SEQUENCE
     CAMERA. Under [glossary:EPS], open DISPLAYS, close DC BUS
     VOLT, open INVERTER 2, open ASCENT ECA CONTROL
     and ASCENT ECA, close DESCENT ECA, DESCENT ECA
     CONTROL, TRANSLUNAR BUS TIE, close CROSS TIE BAL
     LOADS, open CROSS TIE BUS, close BAT FEED TIES.
     Over.

[02:15:41:29]
CDR: That's been completed, Jack.

[02:15:41:55]
CC:  Okay, Jim. And we've already got a change to
     what we just told you. Under [glossary:ECS], close the
     CABIN REPRESS, and insure that the ASA BREAKER
     is closed under S and C.

[02:15:42:16]
CDR: The ASA BREAKER is closed, but I closed the
     CABIN REPRESS.

[02:15:42:25]
CC:  Okay, Jim. Looks like what we have to do is - In
     order to maintain even heating, we just have to
     yaw the whole machine about 90 degrees per hour
     in increments. So we'll give you a call when it's
     time to yaw 90 degrees.

[02:15:43:04]
CDR: Okay. We have to YAW the machine as I understand
     it, Houston, and you'll give it to me in increments of 90 degrees.

[02:15:43:11]
CC:  That's affirm.

[02:15:44:16]
_page : 246
_tape : Tape 43/6
CC:  Okay, Jim. Your present configuration has
     the following features. We got the electrical
     BUSES cross tied through the BAL LOAD circuit
     breakers, and we have AUTO CABIN REPRESS. One
     thing we'd like to do right now is to give you
     an uplink, so immediately we have to, on panel 11,
     close the UPDATA LINK circuit breaker. Go to
     [glossary:P00] and DATA. Over.

[02:15:44:52]
CDR: Okay. We're going to [glossary:P00] and DATA. The circuit
     breaker is closed.

[02:15:48:57]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius. Did you say that you had a
     new pad for us to copy?

[02:15:49:02]
CC:  Jim, I passed that newest pad that we have to
     Fred about 30 minutes ago. That's our latest.
     It's PC plus 2, and it begins with [glossary:NOUN 33] of
     79 hours 27 minutes and 40.13 seconds. You got
     that one?

[02:15:49:25]
CDR: Okay. We've got that one. What kind of a ATT
     HOLD MODE do you want us to do? Do you want us
     to do WIDE DEADBAND? I didn't ... on the [glossary:DAP].

[02:15:49:40]
CC:  Jim, the deadband is good the way it is. It's
     5 degrees, if you want to stay in it. And stay
     in the [glossary:PGNS] ATT HOLD mode.

[02:15:49:49]
CDR: Okay.

[02:15:50:33]
CC:  Two things, Jim. We want you to know that there's
     some pretty big attitude errors in, so if you go
     to AUTO, the computer is going to try to crank
     you around, and the other thing is don't drink
     water out of the [glossary:LM].

[02:15:50:54]
CDR: Okay. You might think about this. You know we
     lost our oxygen pressure in the command module.

[02:15:51:56]
CC:  Aquarius, we're finished with the uplink. The
     computer is yours, and you can open the UPDATA
     LINK circuit breaker.

[02:15:52:18]
CDR: Okay. We've opened up the UPDATA LINK, and we've
     gone OFF of DATA, and I've got 16 20 in the
     computer.

[02:15:52:28]
CC:  Roger, Jim. I guess we're going to just kind of
     perk away here now.

[02:15:52:37]
_page : 247
_tape : Tape 43/7
CMP: Okay, Jack. One more question about Odyssey here.

[02:15:52:45]
CC:  Go ahead, Jack.

[02:15:52:50]
CMP: Okay. How about the service module O<sub>2</sub> supply
     valve? Do you want that off?

[02:15:53:01]
CC:  Affirmative. Service module O<sub>2</sub> supply off, Jack.

[02:15:53:06]
CMP: Okay. On the way.

[02:15:53:17]
CC:  And, Jim, we see a PROGRAM ALARM in there. We
     think it's just got to do with pulling the UPDATA
     LINK circuit breaker - UPLINK too fast.

[02:15:53:30]
CDR: Roger. I don't see it. Should I reset?

[02:15:53:40]
CC:  Go ahead and reset, Jim.

[02:15:56:11]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[02:15:56:16]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[02:15:56:21]
CDR: One thought that might occur here is that if we
     have low descent water pressure, we might consider taking the [glossary:PLSS] water and fill it in reverse. If that works, you might look at a
     procedure for that.

[02:15:56:34]
CC:  That's a good thought. Let us bounce that around
     a little.

[02:15:57:12]
CC:  Okay, Jim. That's a good thought, and we've
     looked at that, and it looks like that's feasible.
     So if and when we need to do that, we will.

[02:15:58:11]
CDR: And, something else, Jack. When it's time for
     me to make my 90-degree yaw, what I planned on
     doing was going to NOUN 76 hold and just pulse
     and yaw several times until the yaw start and hope
     that pitch and roll stay within the limit.

[02:15:58:37]
CC:  Roger. It sounds like a good plan and you can
     use your [glossary:TTCA] in MIN IMPULSE to take care of
     pitch and roll.

[02:15:58:47]
CDR: Okay.

[02:16:00:21]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We see ASCENT O<sub>2</sub> tank number 2 building up again, so we'd like to use
     something out of it, so turn on ascent O<sub>2</sub> tank
     number 2 and turn off descent O<sub>2</sub>.

[02:16:00:39]
_page : 248
_tape : Tape 43/8
CDR: Roger. Opening up ascent O<sub>2</sub> tank number 2, and
     turning off descent.

[02:16:03:01]
CC:  And, Aquarius, Houston. We're starting to think
     about CO<sub>2</sub> buildup up in the command module there
     so we've got a recommendation, and what we're
     recommending is that you take the commander's
     hoses in the [glossary:LM] and put a cap over the red return
     hose and then figure out a way to fasten those
     hoses so they blow up into the [glossary:CSM] by extending
     them up through the tunnel as far as possible.
     And we'll get some flow out the blue side,
     circulate up and around the command module and
     to keep the CO<sub>2</sub> level down.

[02:16:03:43]
CDR: Roger. We're thinking of that too, and one
     problem is that the COMM is connected securely
     to the hose, so we've got to get the COMM cable
     off somehow to get that - So we'll still have
     COMM down here in the [glossary:LM] and you have the hose
     up there.

[02:16:05:10]
CDR: Houston, we're trying to extend that commander's
     hose by use of the vacuum hose.

[02:16:05:22]
CC:  Sounds like a good plan if you can work that
     out, Jim.

[02:16:06:58]
CC:  Aquarius, if you can shake Jack loose there,
     I've got a - some procedures for him to write
     down.

[02:16:07:09]
CDR: Okay. Stand by.

[02:16:07:33]
CMP: Okay, Jack. Is this a long one?

[02:16:07:37]
CC:  Oh, it's about 12 - 15 lines. It's a matter of
     verifying some valves and so forth.

[02:16:07:50]
CMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[02:16:07:53]
CC:  Okay. We want you to go in when you can and
     verify the following valves and leave them as we
     outline here. REPRESS PACKAGE valve, off;
     EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE, off; DIRECT O<sub>2</sub>, off;
     DEMAND REG, off; both WATER ACCUMULATORS, off;
     MAIN REG A and B, open; WATER GLYCOL - correction - WATER and then GLYCOL TANK INLET and
     OUTLET, both. Now if you want to get some water,
     we recommend that you momentarily turn the SURGE
     TANK on to pressurize the system and then turn it
     off and take out water as required. Over.

[02:16:09:33]
_page : 249
_tape : Tape 43/9
CC:  That's it, Jack. And another note on taking
     water; if you don't drain enough water so that - -

[02:16:09:49]
CC:  Say again, Aquarius.

[02:16:09:53]
CDR: That wasn't us, Jack.

[02:16:09:58]
CC:  Okay. One more note on the water, Jack. If
     you don't bleed the pressure off when you -
     don't take enough water to bleed the pressure off
     completely, the pressure that's left on there is
     going to drain away in a period of 1 to 3 hours.
     So it's a small amount of oxygen, but we might
     as well save it. So if you want to eliminate
     that problem you could completely drain the pressure off by putting the water in a water bag and
     saving it that way.

[02:16:10:36]
CMP: Okay. That's a good idea.

[02:16:10:38]
CC:  So that's the end of my - -

[02:16:10:39]
CMP: What I'll do - let me repeat - Okay. Let me
     repeat it all back to you. REPRESS PACKAGE VALVE,
     off; EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE, off; DIRECT O<sub>2</sub>,
     off; both the DEMAND REGs, off; both H<sub>2</sub>O ACCUMULATORS, WATER GLYCOL ACCUMULATORS, off; MAIN
     REG A and B, open; WATER and GLYCOL TANK INLET
     and OUTLET, open; for water, momentarily pressurize the SURGE TANK, take out water as required. You're recommending drain out all the
     water until I can't get any more water out of
     it in order to conserve the oxygen.

[02:16:11:34]
CC:  Okay. We just want you to turn off the water
     accumulators and not the glycol accumulator.
     Over.

[02:16:11:49]
CMP: Okay. These are the water accumulators on 382,
     right?

[02:16:11:57]
CC:  That's affirm. The accumulators on 382.

[02:16:37:40]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[02:16:37:43]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Go.

[02:16:37:48]
CDR: Roger, Jack. We're asking whether [glossary:P51] and a
     [glossary:P52] are required in the back side of the Moon.

[02:16:37:56]
_page : 250
_tape : Tape 43/10
CC: I think so, Jim, but stand by while I verify it.

[02:16:38:23]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[02:16:38:28]
CDR: Go ahead.

[02:16:38:30]
CC:  We think we know where the platform is, Jim.
     The tracking looks real good from the last
     burn. We feel just a [glossary:P52] will be required.

[02:16:38:39]
CDR: Okay.

[02:16:38:54]
CMP: Joe, has your continued tracking changed our
     pericynthion altitude any?

[02:16:39:01]
CC:  Stand by. We'll get the latest on that, Jack.

[02:16:39:50]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[02:16:39:54]
CMP: Go ahead.

[02:16:39:56]
CC:  Roger, Jack. We're still looking at 137 miles
     and Doppler's confirming it. We will have a
     good update after 67 hours.

[02:16:40:08]
CMP: That's good. I want to say you guys are doing
     real good work.

[02:16:40:13]
CC:  So are you guys, Jack.

[02:16:47:06]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[02:16:47:13]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[02:16:47:14]
CC:  Okay, Jim. We've come up with a COMM recommendation which we hope will save some power by
     powering down the power amplifier, if it works.
     And I'd like to read up the steps to you and
     have you think about them for a minute, and we
     recommend trying it before the first yaw
     maneuver. Over.

[02:16:47:43]
CDR: Okay. You can read up the steps.

[02:16:47:48]
CC:  Okay. Step 1, BIOMED off; step 2, go to LOW BIT
     RATE; step 3, go to DOWNVOICE BACKUP; step 4,
     POWER AMP to PRIME; step 5, panel 16, POWER AMP
     CIRCUIT BREAKER open; step 6, RANGE FUNCTION
     switch, off. Read those back to me, and then
     I'll have a remark.

[02:16:48:39]
_page : 251
_tape : Tape 43/11
CDR: Okay. BIOMED, off; LOW BIT RATE; DOWNVOICE
     BACKUP; POWER AMP to PRIME; circuit breakers,
     panel 16, POWER AMP CIRCUIT BREAKER, open.
     RANGE FUNCTION switch, off.

[02:16:48:56]
CC:  Okay. And the note says that you should be able
     to hear us. If we can't hear you in a couple of
     minutes, you should close the POWER AMP circuit
     breaker on panel 16, and we expect to save an
     amp or more on this. It should work in the present attitude. When we go to the new yaw attitude,
     we're thinking about powering up the steerable,
     leaving the POWER AMP off and, if we can get
     good COMM in that mode, we'll still save some
     power. So if you concur, why don't you go ahead.

[02:16:49:44]
CDR: Okay. In this mode, you should hear us - or we
     should hear you, but if you can't hear us, then
     we ought to close POWER AMP circuit breaker again.
     Is that right.

[02:16:49:54]
CC:  That's affirm. We'll just run a little COMM
     check after you get done and see how we're doing.

[02:16:50:03]
CDR: Okay, fine. And if that all fails, we'll go back
     to our original configuration.

[02:16:50:06]
CC:  That's affirm.

[02:16:51:01]
CDR: All amps PRIMARY.

[02:16:51:04]
LMP: POWER AMPs in PRIMARY.

[02:16:51:06]
CDR: Okay. Circuit breakers 16, POWER AMP circuit
     breaker, open; COMM; POWER AMP circuit breaker,
     open.

[02:16:51:18]

[02:16:51:35]
LMP: Yes, I think so; yes, that's off.

[02:16:51:49]
CDR: ... Okay, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read
     me?

[02:16:51:53]
CC:  Aquarius, this is Houston. We read you with
     a lot ... static. How do you read us? Over.

[02:16:52:03]

     to indicate ... read you better.

[02:16:52:15]
CC:  I didn't copy your last remark, Jim. I heard
     that you had a lot of noise in the background
     also.

[02:16:52:23]

     now?

[02:16:52:27]

CC:  Okay. Speak slow because there's a lot of
     noise in the background. Have you completed
     your first 90-degree yaw maneuver? And, if you
     haven't, we recommend it. Over.

[02:17:03:45]
CDR: Okay. We have not. We have not completed it.
     We will start. We want you to monitor the
     maneuver. Over.

[02:17:03:53]
CC:  Okay, Jim. And I want to pass you up a short
     procedure for activating the S-band steerable
     antenna, which we'd like you to do after you
     complete the 90-degree yaw. Are you ready to
     copy? Over.

[02:17:04:14]
CDR: Ready to copy.

[02:17:04:16]
CC:  Okay. First, on panel 11, close the S-BAND
     ANTENNA circuit breaker. Then go to Activation,
     page 28, steerable antenna activation - -

[02:17:04:30]
CDR: Roger. Copy.

[02:17:04:34]
CC:  - - and complete steps 2, 3, and 4 of Activation 28. You'll have to do a [glossary:VERB 64] to get
     the pitch and yaw angles, and the last step is
     on panel 16, S-BAND ANTENNA HEATER circuit
     breaker to CLOSE. Over.

CC:  Aquarius, Houston. That procedure I just passed
     you, please disregard it. Over.

[02:17:05:50]
CDR: Disregard it. Okay. Do you want me to start
     my yaw maneuver now? And I'll be yawing to my
     right. One-way maneuver.

[02:17:05:59]
CC:  Roger. Right yaw is acceptable, but wait 1
     before you start the maneuver.

[02:17:39:52]
CC:  Okay, Jim, since we're in LOW BIT RATE now, we
     cannot monitor the [glossary:DSKY] for program alarms,
     et cetera, and we recommend that, in order for
     you to do so on board, you push in the following
     circuit breakers: On panel 11 and panel 16 the
     ANUNCIATOR/DOCK/COMPONENT circuit breakers. That
     will allow you to monitor your [glossary:DSKY] warning
     lights. Over.

     ANUNCIATOR/DOCK/COMPONENT circuit breakers on
     panel 11, third row, far right, under LIGHTING;
     and on panel 16, also under LIGHTING, second
     row, third from the left. Over.

[02:17:41:23]

     breakers - engaged.

[02:17:41:30]
CC:  Okay, real good.

[02:17:51:02]

[02:17:51:21]
_page : 259
_tape : Tape 44/7
CDR: Joe, it appears that the best detent possibly
     to put the stars in the [glossary:AOT], would be either
     number 2 or 4. The rendezvous radar antenna
     is now in the way. You might think of a procedure to get rid of it with minimum power
     and then we maybe we'll be able to see stars
     in a couple of minutes here in a lower detent.

[02:17:51:48]
CC:  Okay, Jim. I think I understood that the
     rendezvous radar antenna is in the way and you
     would like a procedure to get it out of the
     way. Is that right?

[02:17:52:00]
CDR: That's affirm; at the proper time, and with
     minimum power.

[02:17:52:06]
CC:  Roger. Understand. We'll work that.

[02:17:58:28]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[02:17:58:34]
CDR: Go ahead.

[02:17:58:36]
CC:  Okay. Jim, we have a handover coming up on
     the hour; that's in a minute and a half. On 
     the hour, we would like you to turn the S-BAND
     TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER switch to OFF, and 5 minutes later turn it back to PRIMARY. Over.

[02:17:59:17]
CDR: Okay, Houston. Shortly you want us to turn
     the S-BAND TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER to OFF; 5 minutes later, turn it back to PRIMARY.

[02:17:59:29]
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim. After the handover
     apparently they want to make sure that they
     lockup with you and not the [glossary:IU].

[02:17:59:43]
CDR: Roger. And let me know when you want me to
     turn it off.

[02:17:59:51]
CC:  Roger. You can turn it off now.

[02:18:00:18]

     S-BAND TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER off?

[02:18:00:24]

[02:18:00:31]
CDR: Turning it off now.

[02:18:08:25]

[02:19:32:16]
CC:  Okay, Jim. In order to save on an amp or 2 of
     power here, we'd like you to go to the DOWN
     VOICE BACKUP COMM configuration, which is pulling
     the power and circuit breaker and going to DOWN
     VOICE BACKUP. If we get into a COMM problem, all
     you have to do is reverse that configuration, and
     it should be good again. Over.

[02:19:32:50]
CDR: Okay, we'll go to DOWN VOICE BACKUP and pull the
     POWER AMPL circuit breaker, and if we get into
     trouble, we'll come back again.

[02:19:32:57]
CC:  Okay, real fine, and we estimate the next yaw
     maneuver should start at about [time:02:20:02:00|68:02]. Over.

[02:19:33:08]

     That is, we want to make sure we have everything

     we ought to have a procedure for powering up the
     command module again when we have to go back into
     the command module ...

[02:20:38:29]
CC:  Okay, Jim. We copied that. First of all, you
     want to go through the circuit by circuit breaker
     careful powered-up procedure for the next [glossary:DPS]
     burn, and we're working on that. Secondly, you
     want a procedure for powering the command module
     up again when you have to re-enter it and power
     it up and we're talking about that and working
     one up, and we'll get both those for you ...

CDR: Roger.

[02:20:39:06]
CMP: Joe, can you also get us an idea about how far
     out we can expect to make it on the command
     module batteries.

[02:20:39:16]
CC:  Okay, Jack. It sounds as though we probably
     don't want to power up the command module before
     [glossary:EI] minus 2 hours. That doesn't mean we can't
     start our procedure a good deal before that,
     but we don't want to power it up much before
     [glossary:EI] minus 2. Over.

[02:20:39:42]
CMP: Okay. I was just thinking in case something -
     we had the sort of problem here about how we
     would go about getting in the command module ...
     we need to power up - and - in order to make
     it back into Earth.

[02:20:40:00]
CC:  Right, Jack. It's quite clear that we're going
     to have to very carefully make up a full checklist for you on that; we'll do it.

CC:  Roger, Jim. We just thought of something;
     namely, that we probably should get the lithium
     hydroxide canisters out of the command module
     reasonably soon just to make certain that they
     don't stay in there and possibly swell up until
     they'd be hard to get out. I wouldn't wake up

[02:21:24:21]
CDR: Go ahead.

[02:21:24:23]
CC:  Okay. Our estimate is that we will start powering up for the [glossary:DPS] burn at about 76 hours elapsed,
     which is about 6-3/4 hours from now.

[02:21:24:40]
CDR: Roger, Joe. Understand.

[02:21:24:42]
LMP: Okay, Joe, about 76 hours or so and I guess you
     misunderstood. My question was what was the [glossary:GET]
     way back when, when I first came across to the [glossary:LM]
     and transferred to [glossary:LM] power? How long have we
     been living on the [glossary:LM], now?

[02:21:25:00]
CC:  Oh; Roger. Stand by. I'll give you that. Yes,
     I just didn't understand.

[02:21:29:28]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[02:21:29:35]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[02:21:29:36]
CC:  Okay, the time of transfer to [glossary:LM] power was
     57 hours, 11 minutes. For your information,
     we seem to be reasonably fat on power. In fact,
     we are looking at a procedure that we might
     recommend to you later on after the burn and so
     forth of powering up one of the command module
     main buses via the [glossary:LM] umbilical. This would
     enable us possibly to charge up the command
     module batteries. Over.

[02:21:30:16]
LMP: Okay, Joe. That sounds great. I just thought
     that to pass the time, I'd do a little backseat
     quarterbacking, here.

[02:22:52:20]
LMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[02:22:52:23]
CC:  Okay, Fred. I have a few words for you on some
     things we want to do in the next few hours, and
     in order to get good COMM for that and also in
     order to give [glossary:FIDO] a few minutes of ranging, I
     want to have you put the POWER AMPLIFIER circuit
     breaker in panel 16 in, the VOICE FUNCTION switch
     to VOICE, and RANGING FUNCTION switch to RANGING.
     Over.

[02:22:53:17]
LMP: Now I'm in NORMAL voice and RANGING is up.

[02:22:53:22]
CC:  Okay, Fred. And you're loud and clear down here
     now. Okay. What we're getting a procedure ready
     for you is to do an [glossary:AOT] Sun check at approximately
     74 hours or in just a little over 3 hours.
     That will be a detent 2; we'll have a detail procedure
     up shortly and it will include a rendezvous
     radar redesignation to get it out of the way and
     a [glossary:P52] maneuver to the attitude. It's our feeling
     that if that checks out within 1 degree that your
     platform will be okay for the burn without a
     subsequent [glossary:P52]. If it's not within 1 degree, we
     are working up an Earth/Sun alinement procedure
     to aline the platform, and we'll have that up
     to you later. Okay. Assuming that the Sun check
     is okay, we will then give you a star for a confidence
     check on the back side when you're in
     the darkness. We'll be updating a burn pad to
     you prior to [glossary:LOS] going around the Moon. We'll
     have another look at you after [glossary:AOS], and we'll
     update the pad if required. Right now that
     update should be very small. Over.

[02:22:54:48]
_page : 274
_tape : Tape 47/2
LMP: Okay. Stand by 1.

[02:22:55:52]
LMP: Okay. Joe. As I read that, at 74 hours we're
     going to do an [glossary:AOT] Sun check at detent 2, which
     is going to require the rendezvous radar out of
     the way. And we use [glossary:P52] AUTO maneuver to get
     there, or at least the angles out of that, and
     if this passes within 1 degree, you're saying
     the platform is okay for the maneuver, and we
     won't need a subsequent [glossary:P52]. But even if it is
     okay, you'll give us a star which we can use for
     our check when we're in darkness. If this check
     flunks, you'll pass us on up then an Earth/Moon
     aline procedure.

[02:22:56:45]
CC:  Okay, Fred. That's correct, except the aline
     procedure that we're working on is an Earth/Sun
     aline, and other than that, that's correct.
     Incidentally, this TC plus 2 maneuver looks like
     it will still be around a 900-foot-per-second
     maneuver and that it will get you back to the
     mid-Pacific line at 142 hours.

[02:22:57:15]
LMP: Okay. That was an Earth/Sun check, John. We're
     getting a little close to the Moon now. And the
     TC plus 2 maneuver still looks about 900 foot
     per second to get us at mid-PAC, at about
     142 hours.

[02:22:57:32]
CC:  That's right.

[02:23:05:12]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

     we'll be talking to you.

[02:23:09:13]
LMP: One other thing you might have somebody look at -
     I don't want to bother the guys upstairs - the
     drain hose that we've got in the command module,
     I wonder if we can find out if it will plug into
     the [glossary:PLSS] and in which case we can keep transferring - 
     later on at least - the command module
     water into the [glossary:LM] via the [glossary:PLSS].

[02:23:09:43]
CC:  Okay, Fred. You're almost up with us. We are
     looking real hard at getting water from the
     command module waste tank into the [glossary:PLSS], using
     that hose and then dumping it from the [glossary:PLSS] into
     the [glossary:LM] ascent tank, and we think it is feasible;
     we're checking it out to make sure.

[02:23:10:08]

[03:00:27:51]
CC:  Roger. Listen, Charlie Duke wants to talk to
     you - to you about the [glossary:AOT] star check; and, so
     that we can have good COMM, I'd like to reconfigure
     with the POWER AMPLIFIER circuit breaker
     in and the VOICE FUNCTION switch to VOICE and
     while we're at it, we'd like the RANGING FUNCTION
     switch to RANGING. Over.

[03:00:28:15]
CDR: Okay.

[03:00:28:47]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[03:00:28:49]
LMP: Houston, Aquarius.

[03:00:28:51]
CC:  Roger, Fred-o. Reading you - -

[03:00:28:52]
LMP: Okay, Houston, Aquarius. Go ahead.

[03:00:28:54]
CC:  Okay, Fred-o. Reading you 5-by. The procedure
     I'm going to read up to you is a Sun check for
     the - to see if we're going to need an alinement
     or not. If you'll get out your G&N dictionary
     and open it to [glossary:P52], page 34, we'll start at the
     bottom. Over.

[03:00:29:23]
LMP: Okay. Stand by 1.

[03:00:29:32]
LMP: Sounds like you broke out, Charlie.

[03:00:29:36]
_page : 278
_tape : Tape 48/2
CC:  Yes, finally, Fred-o. I've no longer got the
     red spots.

[03:00:29:48]
CC:  Okay. Stand by, Aquarius. We'll be back with
     you momentarily.

[03:00:29:55]
LMP: Okay.

[03:00:31:16]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. You ready with your G&N
     dictionary? Over.

[03:00:31:24]
LMP: Okay. I'm on page 34 now, looking at [glossary:P52].

[03:00:31:28]
CC:  Okay, Fred-o. At the bottom of the page, we
     want step 1, on the flashing 0406, we want an
     option 3, and that'll pull us over to 6; and,
     on the 5025, we want you to do the ENTER on the
     5025, and that'll bring up flashing 0170, and
     load in R<sub>1</sub> 200. Over.

[03:00:32:03]
LMP: Okay. Let me see if I'm with you. We call up
     [glossary:P52] and, on the flashing 0406, we PRO on a
     3 [glossary:REFSMMAT] which leads us to a flashing 5025.
     We ENTER on that. On the flashing 0170, we
     want to ENTER a 200.

[03:00:32:24]
CC:  That's affirmative; and after that, you PRO
     on that, and you come up with a flashing 0688,
     and we'll have to load [glossary:NOUN 88]. And if you're
     ready to copy, I have the Sun half-unit vectors
     at 74 hours [glossary:GET]. Over.

[03:00:32:47]
LMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[03:00:32:48]
CC:  Okay. At Sun half-unit vectors, X, R<sub>1</sub>, is
     plus 0.45498, Y plus 19024, Z plus 08250.
     Over.

[03:00:33:20]
LMP: Okay. We PRO on - after entering the 200. We'll
     get a flashing 0688. We then load the Sun unit
     vectors for 74 hours, which are R<sub>1</sub>
     plus 5 - correction, plus 45498, R<sub>2</sub> plus 19024,
     R<sub>3</sub> plus 08250.

[03:00:33:48]
CC:  Roger. That's good, Fred-o. And that'll bring
     you to step 8, and you get a flashing 5018 when
     you PRO on the [glossary:NOUN 88]. Okay. At 5018, we want
     to do an AUTO maneuver to - to the attitude, so
     just do the - the PRO with the GUIDANCE CONTROL,
     PNGS; MODE CONTROL, PNGS, AUTO; and we'll take
     this attitude. Now, that's going to put us at -
     at attitude for the Sun check. Now, we're being
     a 1.4-degree deadband in this program in a
     docked configuration; so, to help you out, you
     could call [glossary:VERB 62] to get your needles - and it -
     when the needles go through zero or null out
     and - in that deadband - then you take a look
     in the [glossary:AOT] and see how close the Sun is. And
     we want within plus or minus 1 degree. Over.

[03:00:34:52]
_page : 279
_tape : Tape 48/3
LMP: Okay. So we PRO on the [glossary:NOUN 88], and we end up
     with a flashing 5018; and you want an AUTO
     maneuver here rather than using the [glossary:TTCA], so we
     PRO with GUIDANCE, PNGS; MODE CONTROL, AUTO.
     We've got a 1.4-degree deadband with a [glossary:VERB 62]
     will give us the needles to try to zero them in
     and, at that time I look through the [glossary:AOT] and, if
     it's like Apollo 11 Sun check, all we've got to
     have is the Sun somewhere in the - out there
     somewhere on the Sun as it passes. Is that
     correct?

[03:00:35:30]
CC:  I think that's a little tight; that's about a
     quarter degree. We can go a little bit out of
     that. Stand by 1. Fred, we'll get you an
     answer on that one. And also, if you'll stand
     by, we'll give you a [glossary:DAP] load for this maneuver.
     Over.

[03:00:35:51]
LMP: Okay. We'll - You'll give us a [glossary:DAP] load.

[03:00:35:54]
CC:  Roger. Stand by.

[03:00:37:39]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Fred-o, on that - to pass that
     check, the Sun is at - will subtend an arc of
     one-half degree in the [glossary:AOT], so you can be two
     diameters off and still pass the check. Over.

[03:00:37:59]
LMP: Okay. It's a half a degree, and so we can be
     two Sun diameters off and still pass.

[03:00:38:07]
CC:  That's affirmative. And we want you to maneuver
     with a [glossary:DAP] of 0.2 of a degree a second. Over.

[03:00:38:19]
LMP: Okay. You want us to use a [glossary:DAP] of 0.2.

[03:00:38:24]
CC:  Okay. That [glossary:DAP] load, Fred-o, is 31120. Over.

[03:00:38:38]
LMP: Okay. 31120.

[03:00:38:41]
_page : 280
_tape : Tape 48/4
CC:  Roger. Now, if we pass that check, you can
     just terminate [glossary:P52] right there, and we'll give
     you an attitude to go to a burn attitude, and
     from this we can get a star check. If you don't
     pass, we'd like you to do an alinement at 75 hours.
     And, if you're ready to copy, we have some Sun
     half-unit vectors and some Earth half-unit
     vectors at 75 hours. Over.

[03:00:39:25]
LMP: Stand by 1, Charlie.

[03:00:40:00]
CC:  Okay. Go ahead for 75 hours - Sun and Earth
     half-unit vectors.

[03:00:40:05]
CC:  Roger. First with the Sun; for X, plus 45483;
     for Y, plus 19053; for Zebra, plus 08262; Earth
     half-unit vector at 75 hours, plus 32120,
     minus 34155, minus 17370. Over.

[03:00:40:56]
LMP: Okay. Sun half-unit vectors: R<sub>1</sub> plus 45483,
     R<sub>2</sub> plus 19053, R<sub>3</sub> plus 08262; Earth half-unit
     vectors: R<sub>1</sub> plus 32120, R<sub>2</sub> minus 34155, R<sub>3</sub>
     minus 17370.

[03:00:41:24]
CC:  Roger, Fred-o. Good readback. Now, on the
     Earth, we estimate it - if you have to do this
     alinement, that the Earth will be about a
     2-degree Earth. And it'll be approximately
     three-quarters lighted. Now, to mark on the
     Earth, we'd like you to take an imaginary line
     between the horns of the crescent and mark
     midway between the horns. Over.

[03:00:42:00]
LMP: Okay. We got a 2-degree Earth that's three-quarter
     lighted, and we're to imagine a line
     between the horns of the Earth and mark right in
     the center of that line.

[03:00:42:14]
CC:  That's affirmative. Now, on - on this star
     check - correction, the Sun check, Fred, at -
     On the 5018, I got some [glossary:FDAI] angles for you if
     you're ready to copy. Over.

[03:00:42:34]
LMP: Okay. You're talking about the check at 74 hours
     [glossary:GET], right?

[03:00:42:39]
CC:  Roger. Okay. At 74 hours when you start this
     maneuver, the 5018 should look like R<sub>1</sub> of
     2703 degrees, pitch R<sub>2</sub> is 0903, and R<sub>3</sub> of 2908.
     Over.

[03:00:43:11]
_page : 281
_tape : Tape 48/5
LMP: Okay. How about making those all five digit
     readouts; read them again, Charlie.

[03:00:43:16]
CC:  Okay. Pardon me. It's 27030, 09030, 29080.

[03:00:43:33]
LMP: Okay. The 5018 should look like R<sub>1</sub> plus 27030,
     R<sub>2</sub> plus 09030, R<sub>3</sub> plus 29080.

[03:00:43:48]
CC:  Roger. That's good readback. Now, we got one
     more procedure for you; and, right now, we got
     the rendezvous radar stowed and we won't be able
     to see anything out of detent 2, so we'd like
     you to position the radar to 0283; and we have
     a procedure for that. And we'd like you to do
     that right before you get the attitude. Over.

[03:00:44:22]
LMP: Okay. Stand by.

[03:00:44:45]
LMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[03:00:44:47]
_extra : END OF TAPE
CC:  Stand by.

[03:00:45:25]
_page : 282
_tape : Tape 49/1
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. On those 5018 angles we had
     at 74 hours, Fred, that was based on a [glossary:VERB 49]
     to this attitude, and they will be incorrect for
     the two axis maneuvers, so you can just
     scratch them. Over.

[03:00:45:47]
LMP: Okay. You're saying the angles you gave me for
     the 5018, that was for a [glossary:VERB 49], so they won't
     be good for the 5018, and we should scratch them.

[03:00:45:56]
CC:  That's affirmative. Okay. If you're ready to
     copy, I've got this rendezvous radar procedure.
     Over.

[03:00:46:09]
LMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[03:00:46:11]
CC:  Okay. It's about a 10-stepper, but real easy.
     Okay. On CB 16, [glossary:EPS] INVERTER 2, close. CB 11,
     AC BUS A BUS TIE INVERTER 2, close. Panel 14,
     verify INVERTER switch 2. CB 11 RENDEZVOUS
     RADAR 2, close. RENDEZVOUS RADAR, release.
     RENDEZVOUS RADAR to [glossary:LGC] on panel 3. Are you with
     me? Over.

[03:00:47:26]
LMP: Roger. I'm right up with you at step 6. Go
     ahead.

[03:00:47:29]
CC:  Okay, Fred. Good show. Step 6: [glossary:VERB 41] [glossary:NOUN 72]
     ENTER, plus all balls, plus 28300. Step 7:
     Monitor movement with [glossary:VERB 16] [glossary:NOUN 72]. Step 8:
     CB 11 RENDEZVOUS RADAR 2, open. Are you with
     me? Over.

[03:00:48:13]
LMP: Stand by 1.

[03:00:48:28]
LMP: Okay. Go ahead now.

[03:00:48:30]
CC:  Roger. Step 9 is a [glossary:VERB 44]. Step 10: CB 16,
     [glossary:EPS] INVERTER 2, open. Over.

[03:00:48:53]
LMP: Okay. I got it.

[03:00:48:56]
CC:  Okay.

[03:00:48:57]
LMP: Do you want me to read it back now?

[03:00:48:58]
_page : 283
_tape : Tape 49/2
CC:  I got one more for you. You'll copy this and
     give me it all on the readback. Okay. Once
     you get the attitude and you want to use the -
     you want to get the [glossary:AOT] lamp, we got to go CB 16
     [glossary:EPS] INVERTER 2, close; CB 11, AC BUS A [glossary:AOT] LAMP,
     close. After the [glossary:P52], you can open CB 16 [glossary:EPS]
     INVERTER 2, and open CB 11 AC BUS A [glossary:AOT] LAMP and
     AC BUS A BUS TIE INVERTER 2. Over.

[03:00:50:01]
LMP: Okay. Stand by 1.

[03:00:51:10]
LMP: Okay. Let's see if I got it all. For rendezvous
     radar parking: first of all we want CB 16 [glossary:EPS]
     INVERTER 2, closed, CB 11 AC BUS A BUS TIE
     INVERTER 2, closed. Then on panel 14, verify
     INVERTER 2 selected. And CB 11 RENDEZVOUS
     RADAR 2 closed, both breakers. Then we are to
     pull the RENDEZVOUS RADAR RELEASE handle. On
     panel 3, we then want RENDEZVOUS RADAR to [glossary:LGC].
     A [glossary:VERB 41] [glossary:NOUN 72] ENTER with plus all zips,
     plus 28300 in registers 1 and 2. GO on that.
     Then we monitor movement with the 16 72. After
     it gets parked, CB 11 RENDEZVOUS RADAR 2 open,
     followed by [glossary:VERB 44] ENTER. And CB 16 [glossary:EPS]
     INVERTER 2 open. Now, when it comes time for
     the alinement to get an [glossary:AOT] lamp, CB 16, [glossary:EPS]
     INVERTER 2 closed, CB 11 AC BUS A [glossary:AOT] LAMP closed,
     and after the alinement is completed at CB 16,
     [glossary:EPS] INVERTER 2 open, CB 11 AC BUS A [glossary:AOT] LAMP
     open, CB 11 AC BUS A BUS TIE INVERTER 2 open.

[03:00:52:54]
CC:  Good readback, Aquarius. We'll - To get those
     needles on the [glossary:VERB 62], we got to power up the
     commander's [glossary:FDAI]. We'll have that procedure for
     you shortly. Over.

[03:00:53:11]
LMP: Okay.

[03:00:53:29]
CDR: Charlie, Jim here.

[03:00:53:32]
CC:  Roger. Go ahead.

[03:00:53:36]
CDR: Have you run a Earth set alinement in the simulator
     with a docked configuration?

[03:00:53:43]
CC:  Is the question, "Have we run a - an alinement
     in the docked configuration?" That is
     affirmative.

[03:00:53:54]
_page : 284
_tape : Tape 49/3
CDR: Okay. Did you have any trouble controlling the
     vehicle, and what techniques did you use?

[03:00:54:02]
CC:  Briefly, to control pitch and roll, use the [glossary:TTCA],
     as we've practiced; for yaw you can use the ACA.
     Over.

[03:00:54:24]
CDR: Okay. You have no special techniques going back
     and forth between the yaw and the X and Y lines.
     Over.

[03:00:54:33]
CC:  Not right now, Jim. Dave Scott's been running
     these things and we'll get them up to you shortly.
     Over.

[03:00:54:43]
CDR: Okay.

[03:00:54:44]
CC:  We think the alinement's going to be okay, so
     we don't have to do this [glossary:P52] fullup alinement.
     We think the check is going to be okay. Like to
     remind you since you are in ATT - if check does
     not pass, since you are in attitude for the Sun,
     that we'd - We want the Sun half-unit vectors
     first. Over.

[03:00:55:07]
CDR: Roger. Understand.

[03:00:56:14]
CDR: Okay, Houston. It's been over an hour since we
     did our last [glossary:PTC]. You want us to do another one
     now?

[03:00:56:22]
CC:  Stand by 1. Over.

[03:00:57:09]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We'd like you to go ahead
     and yaw 90 for the [glossary:PTC]. Keep a close eye out
     on your middle gimbal angle. You're about
     30 degrees from gimhal lock, and we'll call you
     an OMNI switch halfway through the maneuver.
     Over.

[03:00:57:30]
CDR: Roger.

[03:00:59:27]
LMP: Okay. And, Houston, Aquarius. You might know
     when you've had enough ranging so we can get the
     power amp back off again.

[03:00:59:36]
CC:  Roger, Fred-o. We got one more procedure, and
     we can shut it down, and that's to get the needles
     and the [glossary:FDAI] for this maneuver. That 5018
     could take you to gimbal lock, and we think it's
     a good idea to power up the commander's ball.
     We've got a four-stepper, if you're ready to
     copy. Over.

[03:01:00:15]
_page : 285
_tape : Tape 4914
LMP: Okay, Go ahead.

[03:01:00:16]
CC:  Okay. Verify that you got AC power, in other
     words, the INVERTER 2 selected and the BUS TIE
     INVERTER 2 AC BUS A closed. We'll be under
     FLIGHT DISPLAYS, GASTA closed, commander [glossary:FDAI],
     closed. On the AC BUS A, CBs GASTA closed,
     CONBIANDER [glossary:FDAI] closed. Over.

[03:01:01:04]
LMP: Okay. It's verify we have AC, which is panel 16
     INVERTER 2 closed. CB INVERTER 2 closed. Then
     on panel 11 under FLIGHT DISPLAYS, we want the
     GASTA and the COMMANDER's [glossary:FDAI] breakers closed.
     Also under panel 11, AC BUS A GASTA and COMMANDER's
     [glossary:FDAI] breakers closed.

[03:01:01:25]
CC:  That's affirmative. Over.

[03:01:02:11]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. After the OMNI switch, we
     would like you to get the ranging off, the VOICE
     switch to DOWN VOICE BACKUP, and the POWER AMP
     CB on 16 open. Over.

[03:01:02:31]
LMP: Okay. After the OMNI switch, we'll get the
     POWER AMP off and go back to DOWN VOICE BACKUP
     FTA and the RANGING off. It's your call.

[03:01:02:43]
CC:  Roger. Stand by.

[03:01:02:55]
CC:  Fred-o, we got about 2 minutes to the OMNI switch.
     You can go ahead and power the RANGING down and
     and the DOWN VOICE BACKUP, and we'll give you a
     call on OMNI switch. Over.

[03:01:03:09]
LMP: Okay.

[03:01:03:19]
LMP: How do you read Aquarius now on DOWN VOICE BACKUP?

[03:01:03:24]
CC:  Roger, Aquarius. We are reading you about the
     same, about 2-by.

[03:01:03:34]
LMP: Okay.

[03:01:04:16]

[03:01:09:03]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston. We read you weakly. Go
     ahead.

[03:01:09:11]
LMP: Okay. Vance, if Buzz or Neil are around you
     might ask them if they had to use the [glossary:AOT] lamps
     to shoot the Sun like they did on 11.

[03:01:09:25]
CDR: Well, where's the ...

[03:01:09:34]
LMP: Right down below me here?

[03:01:09:37]
CC:  Fred, breaking in. You're very weak. Understand
     if Buzz or Neil are down here, you'd like to ask
     them if they used the [glossary:AOT] lamp to what? Over.

[03:01:09:52]
CDR: To see the Sun, Vance. It might be possible to
     see the reticle without even having the light on.

[03:01:09:58]
CC:  Oh, I see. See if it's possible to see the
     reticle without the light on. Okay. We'll
     make a check. And one other thing, you might
     move that rendezvous radar antenna to park any
     time now. You can start any time you want.

[03:01:10:19]
CDR: Okay.

[03:01:11:03]
CC:  Jim, Neil is here. He advises that you will not
     need the lamp on for the Sun check but that you
     will need it on for the Earth check. Over.

LMP: Okay. Panel 16 verify and select INVERTER 2.

[03:01:12:28]
CDR: Okay.

[03:01:12:31]
LMP: Okay. On CB 11, give me the RENDEZVOUS RADAR
     breakers, with 30-second spread.

[03:01:12:37]
CDR: Okay. ... at 15, I ...

[03:01:12:45]
LMP: Okay. ... 30 seconds.

[03:01:12:48]
CDR: Okay. Go ahead.

[03:01:12:50]
LMP: Right.

[03:01:13:16]
LMP: Okay. Thirty seconds. AC breaker.

[03:01:13:19]
CDR: Okay. Got a big dip.

[03:01:13:21]
LMP: Okay. Reach up here and give me the ... panel ...

[03:01:13:24]
CDR: Okay. She's pulled.

[03:01:13:33]
LMP: Okay. Panel 3, check the [glossary:LGC].

[03:01:13:36]
CDR: [glossary:LGC].

[03:01:13:37]
LMP: Okay. Give me a [glossary:VERB 41] [glossary:NOUN 72].

[03:01:13:40]
CDR: Still going good, right?

[03:01:13:46]
LMP: Okay. And they're all zips, 28300.

CDR: ... is running away. Docking light.

[03:01:14:26]
LMP: What?

[03:01:14:27]
CDR: Command module docking light. Okay. You got
     them. They're in.

[03:01:14:41]
LMP: Okay. Two RENDEZVOUS RADAR breakers, pull them. ... ...

[03:01:14:55]
LMP: CB 16 INVERTER 2 open.

[03:01:15:02]
CDR: Okay.

[03:01:15:10]
CDR: You know that light on the command module ...?

[03:01:15:43]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston. Over.

[03:01:15:46]
CDR: ... get that thing ...

[03:01:15:51]
CC:  Roger. One correction. We think that the
     cheapest way for you to maneuver to change
     attitude is with minimum pulse ACA. That's to
     do the star mark.

[03:01:16:10]
CDR: We had - Okay. As soon as possible we'll get
     that star data ... we can get to maneuver
     attitude by using [glossary:TTCA].

[03:01:16:23]
CC:  Roger.

[03:01:16:25]
CDR: And, just out of curiosity, we got rid of the
     radar very nicely. It's hanging right in the
     middle of the - the forward digit is the docking
     light on the command module. Can you believe
     that? I don't think it will hurt our Sun check,
     but it'll sure make [glossary:P52] ...

[03:01:16:53]
CC:  Sorry, Jim, but we are only reading you about
     1 by 1.

[03:01:18:21]
CDR: It looks like a piece of wrapping for ... line.

[03:01:18:49]
CDR: You're watching that. Right?

[03:01:19:52]
CDR: It's going to get smaller before it gets larger.

[03:01:21:10]
CDR: Okay. I guess they can close it.

[03:01:22:03]
CDR: Okay. Did you read your figures ...?

[03:01:22:06]
LMP: Yes.

[03:01:22:07]
CDR: Okay.

[03:01:22:45]
CDR: Okay. ... [glossary:P22]. What's our next time line?

[03:01:22:50]
LMP: ... about [time:03:01:30:00|73:30] ...

[03:01:23:56]
CDR: Did you get that or did he give it to you?

[03:01:23:58]
LMP: He gave it to me.

[03:01:24:01]
CDR: Okay. Because I thought he said 2 degrees per
     second. Like to check on that.

[03:01:24:09]
LMP: Okay, Houston; Aquarius.

[03:01:24:11]
CC:  Go ahead, Fred.

[03:01:24:16]
LMP: Okay. Jim thinks he heard something different
     than I copied on the [glossary:DAP] load. Is REGISTER 1
     supposed to be 31120?

[03:01:24:32]
CC:  That's correct, Fred. That was to be 31120.

[03:01:24:40]
CDR: Okay.

[03:01:24:41]
LMP: Okay.

[03:01:24:47]

CDR: Well, they probably don't know what to do there.

[03:01:26:06]
CDR: Okay. And, Houston; Vance.

[03:01:26:09]
CC:  Go ahead, Jim.

[03:01:26:13]
CDR: Just want to get a time check with you. When
     do you want us to start powering up the ball?
     We just got to our [glossary:PTC] attitude.

[03:01:26:21]
CC:  Understand you'd like to know when to power
     up the -

[03:01:26:24]
CDR: We think to take about 15 - -

[03:01:26:25]
LMP: ...

[03:01:26:29]
LMP: Yes. The ball inside the maneuver, we think it
     will take us about 15 minutes to get there. We'd
     like you to confirm that.

[03:01:26:40]
CC:  Stand by 1.

[03:01:26:54]
LMP: ... god damn ...

[03:01:27:28]
CDR: What would that take to use ... use the command
     module or what? To load the [glossary:PLSS] ...

[03:01:27:30]
LMP: ... ... Let's see, about 10 or 11 ...

[03:01:31:29]
CDR: When is that Sun check time supposed to take place?

[03:01:31:32]
LMP: 74 hours 29 minutes ...

[03:01:31:40]
CDR: Okay, Houston; Aquarius. I'd just like to do the
     little Sun check. Do you want me to do it now?

[03:01:31:45]
CC:  Jim, Roger. We just came up with a maneuver time
     of approximately 15 minutes, so if you start any
     time between now and about the next 2 minutes it
     would get you into attitude by [time:03:01:15:00|73:15]. Over.

[03:01:32:06]
CDR: Roger. We'll start the maneuver at this time.
     Okay. Let's go.

[03:01:32:12]
LMP: Okay. [glossary:SPS] ... - -

[03:01:36:51]
CC:  Roger. Reading you, Fred. Go ahead.

[03:01:37:05]

[03:01:37:14]
CDR: Are you monitoring our [glossary:P52] technique?

[03:01:37:19]
CC:  That's negative, Jim. We do not have high bit
     rate data on you now. Over.

[03:01:37:28]
CDR: Okay. Thank you.

[03:01:37:30]
CC:  Roger.

[03:01:37:33]
LMP: And be advised, Vance, that we are getting several
     echos in our COMM downlink here.

[03:01:37:42]

[03:01:38:11]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[03:01:38:12]
CC:  Jim, request you give us high bit rate now. We
     might be able to fix you up on the 120 antenna.

[03:01:38:21]
CDR: Okay. High bit rate.

[03:01:38:25]
CC:  Roger.

[03:01:39:10]

[03:01:39:15]
CDR: Yes.

[03:01:39:20]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston.

[03:01:39:26]
LMP: Go ahead.

[03:01:39:27]
CC:  Fred, we can't lock up on your high bit rate.
     Request you go back low bit rate.

[03:01:39:36]
LMP: Hey, we lost you there, Vance.

[03:01:39:39]
CC:  Roger. Advise, we are not locking up on your
     high bit rate, so you can go back low bit rate.
     Over.

[03:01:39:49]
LMP: Low bit rate.

[03:01:41:14]
LMP: Right here, Jim. There it is. Looks like it ...

     arithmetic.

[03:01:42:24]
LMP: Yes. Don't count your chickens before they hatch.

[03:01:42:28]
CDR: Listen, I'm not.

[03:01:42:40]
CDR: We're ... going to be two diameters out, huh?

[03:01:42:42]
LMP: Yes.

[03:01:42:43]
CDR: Okay. Tell me what that technique is to get the
     lamp on, in case I don't see it.

[03:01:42:48]
LMP: They'll have to give you AC again and you punch
     in your breaker -Well, let's see - I've still
     got H<sub>P</sub> on for the FDAIs, so you're in business
     now. All you need is the lamp breaker, the AC
     BUS A [glossary:AOT] lamp breaker, that is.

[03:01:43:57]
CDR: Let me know when these start going. There's the
     Sun. Give me the - Give me the [glossary:AOT].

[03:01:44:08]
LMP: Okay.

[03:01:44:09]
CDR: Never mind. I don't need it. Go ahead. I got
     it. Never mind.

[03:01:44:16]
LMP: Reticle brightness, want it up? Got the reticle?

[03:01:44:19]

[03:01:44:35]
CDR: Okay.

[03:01:44:37]
LMP: ... ...

[03:01:44:52]

[03:01:45:00]
LMP: Yes. I show it about maybe a third of a
     diameter to the left.

[03:01:45:11]
CDR: Okay. Take a look.

[03:01:45:14]
LMP: Check your needles. You're off in roll, Jim.

[03:01:45:32]
LMP: Pitch and yaw are in, but we're off in your roll
     needle. Better get that ...

[03:01:45:41]
_page : 294
_tape : Tape 40/13
CDR: Okay. It brings it in. Say when.

[03:01:46:05]
CDR: Okay. We got it. I think we got it. What
     diameter was it?

[03:01:46:16]
LMP: Yes. It's coming back in. Just a second.

[03:01:46:25]
CDR: Yes, yaw's coming back in.

[03:01:46:40]
CDR: Just about it.

[03:01:46:44]
LMP: Okay. Yaw is in ...

[03:01:46:46]
CDR: What have you got?

[03:01:46:47]
LMP: ... upper right corner of the Sun.

[03:01:46:52]
CDR: We've got it.

[03:01:46:59]
LMP: You're hot ...

CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[03:01:47:01]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[03:01:47:05]
CDR: Okay. It looks like the Sun check passes.

[03:01:47:10]
CC:  We understand it checks out. We're kind of
     glad to hear that.

[03:01:47:17]
CDR: It's not quite centered, but it's about a
     diameter, a little bit less than a diameter,
     just to one side.

[03:01:47:24]
CC:  Sounds good.

[03:01:47:31]
CDR: Now. Let's get the [glossary:AOT] lamp on.

[03:01:47:34]
LMP: Okay, Jim.

[03:01:47:36]
CDR: Which ... to get the [glossary:AOT] lamp on?

[03:01:47:38]
LMP: Okay. Pull the - your [glossary:AOT] lamp breaker.

[03:01:47:44]
CDR: Got it.

[03:01:47:45]
LMP: Okay. And, Houston, can we proceed with our
     powerdown now? Getting the ball back off and
     [glossary:AOT] lamp, et cetera, AC secured.

[03:01:47:57]
CC:  Stand by on that one for a minute, Fred.

[03:01:48:00]
_page : 295
_tape : Tape 49/14
LMP: - - the ball ... get back to - Okay. What we'd
     like now, I guess, is the next attitude to go to,
     Vance, and we will work on getting there while
     we still have the ball.

[03:01:48:21]
CC:  Roger. We copy.

[03:01:48:24]
CDR: ...

[03:01:49:04]
CDR: Okay. Seventy-four hours.

[03:01:49:14]
LMP: Yes. We're not there yet, really. I've got
     11 minutes to check ... out.

[03:01:50:05]
LMP: Yes. Bring your ... down.

[03:01:50:57]
LMP: Get set. Keep ... It's better in here. Slow
     now ...

[03:01:51:31]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston.

[03:01:51:36]
CDR: Go ahead.

[03:01:51:38]
CC:  Jim, in a moment we will have an attitude for you
     to go to, and recommend that you keep your FDAI up
     while maneuvering to that attitude. After you
     get there, then we will have you widen the deadband
     and eventually go into a [glossary:PTC] about the burn
     attitude.

[03:01:52:05]
CDR: You were cut off slightly, Vance.

[03:01:52:08]
CC:  Roger. We will have an attitude for you to
     maneuver to in a moment. And you should leave
     your FDAI up for that. The attitude is as follows
     if you are ready to copy. Over.

[03:01:52:26]
CDR: Got the book.

[03:01:52:32]
LMP: Go ahead, Vance.

[03:01:52:53]
CC:  Okay. This is [glossary:FDAI] attitudes for the maneuver.
     Yaw 060 degrees, pitch 083 degrees, roll 272 degrees.

[03:01:52:59]
CDR: Let's not read that in the R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>. I don't want
     [glossary:VERB 69] twice. I want [glossary:VERB 49], 58g's so I can
     fly the needle.

[03:01:53:18]
_page : 296
_tape : Tape 49/15
CC:  Jim. Those are not [glossary:VERB 49] angles. Those are
     strictly [glossary:FDAI] attitudes. Over.

[03:01:53:30]
CDR: Okay. I understand, Vance. It's much easier if
     the ball is up to fly the needles; that gives me
     a drift of [glossary:VERB 49], 58g maneuver. We could fly
     that manually.

[03:01:53:50]
CC:  Stand by. We'll try to get you a [glossary:VERB 49] angle.

[03:01:54:06]
LMP: Flying on maneuvers.

[03:01:54:08]
CDR: ...

[03:01:54:50]
CDR: On that last check, what did it look like?

[03:01:54:57]
LMP: ... ... ...

[03:01:56:20]
CDR: This is the first three-man [glossary:LM] we've had.

[03:01:56:25]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston.

[03:01:56:26]
LMP: And, Vance, which - What hack you got now on [glossary:GET]?

[03:01:56:33]
CC:  Okay. Stand by on that, Fred. First, let me
     read up your [glossary:VERB 49] attitude, if you are ready
     to copy.

[03:01:56:45]
LMP: Go ahead.

[03:01:56:46]
CC:  Okay. Yaw 27100, pitch 35500, roll 33000. Over.

[03:01:57:05]
CDR: Ask him if you keep it in AUTO maneuver there.

[03:01:57:09]
LMP: Okay. [glossary:VERB 49], yaw plus 27100, pitch plus 35500,
     roll plus 33000. And do you think it's cheaper
     to manually make that maneuver or take the 0.2-degree 
     range and go in AUTO maneuver?

[03:01:57:50]
CC:  Fred, we're recommending AUTO maneuver. Over.

[03:01:57:57]
LMP: Okay. AUTO maneuver, and could you give me a
     [glossary:GET] right now.

[03:01:58:04]
CC:  Okay. I understand you want [glossary:GET] of the burn.
     Stand by 1.

[03:01:58:10]
LMP: That's negative, Vance. What is your clock reading right now?

[03:01:58:14]
_page : 297
_tape : Tape 49/16
CC:  Okay. When I give you a hack, it will be [time:03:01:59:00|73:59],
     and that's about 40 seconds away.

[03:01:58:27]
LMP: Okay. I think we will make one last check there
     with the half-unit vectors for 74 hours before
     we leave this attitude.

[03:01:58:36]
CC:  Okay. And I'm going to calculate in the 2 seconds
     in giving you the time hack coming up on
     [time:03:01:59:00|73:59:00] when I give the mark. Okay. Stand by.

[03:01:58:59]
CC:  MARK.

[03:01:59:06]
LMP: Looked good.

[03:01:59:09]
CC:  Okay. I understand you got it.

[03:01:59:11]
LMP: You want me to PROCEED one more time on that, Jack?

[03:01:59:15]
CMP: Roger. Yes, go ahead.

[03:01:59:45]
CDR: Oh, it's on; it's a center.

[03:01:59:56]
CDR: That's it, she's right on still. Okay. I have,
     too. That's better than I expected.

[03:02:00:05]
LMP: Okay. Let's do a [glossary:VERB 74] and get out of here.

[03:02:00:12]
CDR: If we can. Go to [glossary:P00]? Okay. I'm going to go
     to -

[03:02:00:19]

[03:02:00:52]
CDR: Okay. That's - -

[03:02:00:56]
LMP: Yaw, pitch, and roll.

[03:02:01:01]
CDR: Let me see. No, that's yaw, pitch, and - Okay.
     Everything's ... ... That's roll, pitch, and yaw.

[03:02:01:29]
LMP: Roll, pitch, and yaw.

[03:02:01:32]
CDR: Everything ... yaw.

[03:02:01:46]
CDR: The roll's going to be down here, but the yaw
     will be off the bellyband. ... procedure, or
     don't you have a procedure?

[03:02:02:08]
CDR: Roll, pitch, and yaw, but drift's the one. That
     would be gimbal lock if it wasn't for being off ...

[03:02:02:32]
_page : 298
_tape : Tape 49/17
CDR: And, Houston, I see that this maneuver gives us
     a roll of 27172, a pitch of 08301. Is that what
     they gave us?

[03:02:02:47]
CC:  This is Houston. Please repeat.

[03:02:02:55]
CDR: Houston, did you give us [glossary:VERB 49] in yaw, pitch,
     and roll, or register 1, 2, and 3?

[03:02:03:03]
CC:  We gave it as yaw, pitch, and roll.

[03:02:03:09]
CDR: Okay. We wrote it as roll, pitch, and yaw.

[03:02:03:23]
CC:  Okay, Jim. We read it to you as yaw, pitch, and
     roll, and we should have given it to you registers
     1, 2, and 3; but we did not. So register 1 is
     33000, register 2 is 35500, and register 3 is
     27100.

[03:02:03:52]
LMP: Okay, Vance. Register 1 will be 33000,
     register 2 35500, register 3 27100.

[03:02:04:05]
CC:  Hey, Fred? Stand by on that.

[03:02:04:11]
LMP: Okay. Plus 27100. Okay. Stand by. Right now
     you can enter ...

[03:02:04:43]
CC:  Okay. Apollo 13, Houston.

[03:02:04:49]
CDR: Go ahead.

[03:02:04:51]
CC:  Okay, Jim. We sorted it out, and it is correct
     the way we gave you the first time. So, R<sub>1</sub> 27100,
     and in the [glossary:LM], that's yaw; R<sub>2</sub> 35500, and that's
     pitch; R<sub>3</sub> 33000, and that's roll in the [glossary:LM]. Over.

[03:02:05:24]
CDR: I agree with you. Okay. 5018, it's there, and
     5018, and that's what it will be. Okay.

[03:02:05:32]
CC:  That's right. That's [glossary:VERB 49].

[03:02:05:46]
CMP: There are 25. 25, ENTER.

[03:02:05:51]
CMP: Okay. Plus 27100, plus 35500, plus 33000.

[03:02:06:07]
LMP: Okay.

[03:02:06:57]
LMP: So far we're ... what can we do about it?

[03:02:07:48]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston. You better watch that middle
     gimbal. Over.

[03:02:07:56]
_page : 299
_tape : Tape 49/18
LMP: Roger. We're watching that middle gimbal. We
     have as a roll, 27172. Our yaw is - that's
     register 3 - 3300. How did we get this?

[03:02:08:36]
CC:  And, Apollo 13. We have a procedure for you
     describing how to widen the deadband to 5 degrees later on. But stand by for that.

[03:02:08:51]
CC:  Apollo 13, you're heading for gimbal lock. You
     better stop everything.

[03:02:09:01]
LMP: Yes, we're back in ATT HOLD now. We're trying
     to stop it.

[03:02:09:04]
CC:  Roger.

[03:02:09:09]
CDR: I'm going to roll it.

[03:02:09:25]
LMP: Can you give it a roll up now, Jim?

[03:02:09:27]
CDR: Yes.

[03:02:09:39]
CDR: I don't understand why we got that.

[03:02:10:30]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston. It looks like [glossary:VERB 49]
     maneuver will just take you right through there.
     You're going to have to go around it. Over.

[03:02:10:41]
CDR: Okay. That's what we're in the process of doing.

[03:02:10:43]
CC:  Si, si.

[03:02:10:47]
LMP: We're manually working our way around it, Vance.

[03:02:10:53]
CC:  Okay.

[03:02:10:54]
CDR: Pitch is 083.

[03:02:11:02]
CDR: How do I work my way around it? I'm 58g's, and
     I want yaw 231, right? I think they screwed up
     on our - our numbers again.

[03:02:11:26]
LMP: Zero out the needles; we're heading that way, and
     then we'll stop and talk about it.

[03:02:11:53]
CDR: No. Pitch is 83. Pitch should be up here.
     ... ... What's the number, 552?

[03:02:12:11]
LMP: Pitch should be 83 degrees. ...

[03:02:12:24]
CDR: Roll 232; that's a long way to roll, ...
     yaw is 62 ...

[03:02:12:30]

[03:02:13:28]
LMP: ...

[03:02:13:44]
CDR: Okay. What's that read; there's 180.

[03:02:13:57]
LMP: Roger.

[03:02:14:04]
CDR: ... is over here. Houston, 13.

[03:02:14:10]
CC:  Go ahead, 13.

[03:02:14:15]
CDR: There's something screwed up on our burn attitude.
     We're not getting the proper readings on the ball
     and the needles are centered. I'm not too sure
     what's wrong. Let's go through this procedure
     again.

[03:02:14:30]
CC:  Okay. Stand by 1. Let us look at it.

[03:02:14:31]
LMP: - - angles you gave us, Vance, aren't correlating
     the [glossary:VERB 49] numbers.

[03:02:14:38]
CC:  Okay. We'll check into it.

[03:02:14:53]
CDR: We know the ball is good. Why don't we just get
     a 40?

[03:02:15:38]
LMP: You better watch out; it's heading that way.

[03:02:15:50]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston.

[03:02:15:56]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[03:02:15:57]
CC:  Okay, Jim. To answer your last question, do you
     have [glossary:PGNS] checklist page 57 handy?

[03:02:16:09]
CDR: Right, we do. I'll check it.

[03:02:16:12]
CC:  As soon as you open up to that, I'll explain it.

[03:02:16:40]
LMP: Okay. Go ahead, Vance.

[03:02:16:42]
CC:  Okay. Under [glossary:VERB 49], crew-defined maneuver, the
     flashing 0622 are the angles that we gave you
     that were loaded. The flashing 5018 actually
     represents [glossary:FDAI] angles, and so what you read on
     5018 should - -

[03:02:17:05]
_page : 301
_tape : Tape 49/20
LMP: Right. I understand.

[03:02:17:06]
CC:  - - should not correspond with [glossary:NOUN 22].

[03:02:17:13]
LMP: Yes. We appreciate that, Vance. It's just
     that right now we're trying to follow center
     needles that appear to be possibly taking us
     away from the place we know we want to be in
     the ball.

[03:02:17:34]
CC:  Okay, You're tending toward the gimbal lock
     area again. Heads up.

[03:02:17:42]
LMP: Roger.

[03:02:18:00]
CDR: There's our 83. - -

[03:02:18:36]

[03:02:18:41]
_comment : "Actually attributed to CDR/LMP"
CDR: Go ahead.

[03:02:18:43]
CC:  13, request you put in the POWER AMPL circuit
     breakers so that we can take a look at your
     angles.

[03:02:18:54]
LMP: You got it.

[03:02:18:56]
_extra : END OF TAPE
CC:  Thank you. And now high bit rate.

[03:02:19:47]
_page : 302
_tape : Tape 50/1
CC:  Okay, 13; we're getting your high bit rate now
     and taking a look at your angles.

[03:02:23:01]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston.

[03:02:23:11]
CDR: Go ahead.

[03:02:23:12]
CC:  Okay, Jim, we just took a look at your angles,
     and you're looking good here. Your [glossary:PGNS] is
     looking good. We can't yet explain the attitude
     error needle thing, but I suggest you continue
     on in your maneuver.

[03:02:23:32]
CDR: Roger. Okay. We've just about got roll.

[03:02:26:41]
CC:  13, Houston. We see you now in the AUTO maneuver.
     How are your error needles looking now?

[03:02:26:50]
CDR: Okay. They look like they are working their
     way in, Vance.

[03:02:26:54]
CC:  Okay. You think maybe they are working right
     now?

[03:02:27:00]
CDR: Yes. Because we got a 270-degree roll, our pitch
     and yaw needles are reversed.

[03:02:27:06]
CC:  Okay.

[03:02:27:22]
LMP: Say, how do you read, Vance? ...

[03:02:27:28]
CC:  Fred, you are starting to fade out. Request
     AFT OMNI, OMNI AFT.

[03:02:27:37]
LMP: Okay. You've got AFT OMNI.

[03:02:27:39]
CC:  Thank you.

[03:02:28:34]
CC:  13, Houston.

[03:02:28:53]
CDR: Okay, Houston; Aquarius. We appear to be there -
     at the burn attitude. And now do you want us to
     change the [glossary:DAP]?

[03:02:29:01]
CC:  Roger, Jim. We have a procedure to give you
     for widening the deadband to 5 degrees for the
     [glossary:PTC] in the next 3 or 4 hours, if you're ready
     to copy.

[03:02:29:13]
_page : 303
_tape : Tape 50/2
CDR: Okay, stand by.

[03:02:29:29]
CDR: Go ahead.

[03:02:29:30]
CC:  Okay. [glossary:VERB 21], NOUN 01, ENTER; 3011, ENTER;
     44, ENTER. Now, that's the procedure for
     widening the deadband to 5 degrees with the [glossary:DAP].
     Later on, prior to the burn, you would return
     the deadband to 1.4 degrees, and if you're
     ready to copy, I'll read you that.

[03:02:30:11]
CDR: Stand by.

[03:02:30:13]
CC:  Okay.

[03:02:30:38]
CDR: Go ahead.

[03:02:30:40]
CC:  Okay. To return the deadband later to
     1.4 degrees: [glossary:VERB 21], NOUN 01, ENTER; 3011,
     ENTER; 200, ENTER. Over.

[03:02:31:03]
LMP: Okay, Vance. To widen the deadband, we'll enter
     a [glossary:VERB 21], NOUN 01, ENTER; 3011, ENTER; 44, ENTER.
     Before the burn to go back to narrow deadband,
     it's [glossary:VERB 21], NOUN 01, ENTER; 3011, ENTER;
     200, ENTER.

[03:02:31:22]
CC:  Roger, Readback correct.

[03:02:32:30]
CDR: And, Houston, I'll guess we'll do this [glossary:PTC] in
     yaw, and do you want them all powered down?

[03:02:32:45]
CC:  Stand by.

[03:02:33:06]
CC:  Okay, Apollo 13. Over.

[03:02:33:11]
CDR: Go ahead.

[03:02:33:13]
CC:  Okay, that's affirm. You'll be doing the [glossary:PTC]
     in yaw, and we'll give you a call at each time
     you change yaw - yaw attitude. Aside from that,
     request low bit rate off; then DOWN VOICE BACKUP
     OFF; then POWER AMPL OFF; and then FDAI OFF.

[03:02:33:42]
LMP: Okay, Vance. On the power down, we go low bit
     rate; DOWN VOICE BACKUP, we'll pull the POWER
     AMPL breaker; and we'll power down the FDAI and
     the AC.

[03:02:33:55]
CC:  That's affirm. And the [glossary:AOT], too.

[03:02:34:59]
_page : 304
_tape : Tape 50/3
CDR: Okay, are you all set for old a -

[03:02:35:02]
LMP: Okay, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read
     DOWN VOICE BACKUP?

[03:02:35:07]
CC:  Reading you loud - loud and clear now, Fred.

[03:02:35:13]
LMP: Okay.

[03:02:35:18]
CDR: Oh, Vance, do you want to stay in this attitude
     for a certain length of time before we start
     maneuvering?

[03:02:35:26]
CC:  Roger. Jim, we'll keep you there for about an
     hour, and then we'll have our first 90-degree
     rotation.

[03:02:35:36]
CDR: Okay. How wide do I make the deadband?

[03:02:35:52]
CC:  Say again.

[03:02:37:15]
CDR: ... the other OMNI's in.

[03:02:37:27]
LMP: Yes. My forward OMNI is in.

[03:02:37:29]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston. Forward OMNI should be best.

[03:02:37:36]
LMP: We're there.

[03:02:39:14]
CDR: I don't see why the hell he ...

[03:02:39:19]
LMP: I know. I don't know. I don't know where that
     5 degrees ...

[03:02:39:40]
CMP: Cut it.

[03:02:39:48]
CDR: ...

[03:02:40:24]
CDR: Oh-h. ... that thing against the ...

[03:02:42:15]

     little.

[03:02:42:19]
LMP: Go ahead.

[03:02:50:32]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[03:02:50:37]
LMP: Go ahead.

[03:02:50:39]
_page : 305
_tape : Tape 50/4
CC:  Fred, one - one point on the [glossary:PTC] requests that,
     about an hour or less from now when you make
     your 90-degree change, that you do it in [glossary:PGNS]
     AUTO as opposed to ATT HOLD. Reason is that if
     you're in ATT HOLD, it establishes a new null
     point each time you stop the - the maneuver.
     Over.

[03:02:51:10]
LMP: Okay. You want us to make the maneuver with
     [glossary:PGNS] AUTO rather than the [glossary:PGNS] ATT HOLD. Is
     that right?

[03:02:51:18]
CC:  Yes. That's correct.

[03:02:51:33]
CC:  And, Fred, advise that it - it is a manual
     maneuver.

[03:02:51:53]
CC:  13, Houston. You'd be using X-axis override.
     It will be a manual maneuver, but with the [glossary:PGNS]
     AUTO mode.

[03:02:52:07]
LMP: Okay.

[03:02:52:10]
CC:  And if you're ready to copy, Charlie is going to
     be on in a minute with some recommended checklist changes for your upcoming burn. Over.

[03:02:52:25]
LMP: Okay. Stand by 1.

     Over.

[03:02:54:23]
LMP: Houston, Aquarius. Which book do you want me
     to update here, Charlie, the contingency QR [glossary:DPS]?

[03:02:54:38]

     is [glossary:EPS] Activation, step 2, CB(16) [glossary:EPS]: DISPLAY,
     CLOSE. Over.

[03:02:55:18]
LMP: Okay. On page 1, we need [glossary:EPS] DISPLAY, CLOSE,
     under [glossary:EPS] Activation, step 2.

[03:02:55:27]
CC:  Okay. Turning over to page 2, we'd like you
     to complete step 5 and step 6 with the following
     changes. POWER/TEMP MONITOR, AC BUS, INVERTER 2,
     then INVERTER 1. Fourth line CB(11), [glossary:EPS]:
     INVERTER 2, OPEN. Over.

[03:02:56:08]
LMP: Okay, on step number - or page 2, we should do
     step 5 and modify step 6 second line to read
     INVERTER 2, then INVERTER 1, to the last line
     of step 6 CB(11), [glossary:EPS] INVERTER 2, OPEN.

[03:02:56:30]
CC:  Okay. That will be on CB(16), Fred-o, but
     it's INVERTER 2 OPEN. Okay, on the Mission
     Timer Activation. Do step 1, correction,
     lines 1 and 2. Omit "set mission timer on [glossary:CSM]
     mark" and insert a [glossary:VERB 16], [glossary:NOUN 65], set mission
     timer. Over.

[03:03:05:34]
CC:  Roger. Good readback. Okay, continuing on.
     Nothing on page 6; nothing on page 7. Nothing
     on page 8 or 9. Nothing on page 10 or 11.
     On page 12, we want the - to perform - -

[03:03:05:59]
LMP: Hold it. Hold on just a minute, Charlie.

[03:03:06:01]
CC:  Okay.

[03:03:06:18]
LMP: Okay. Go ahead, page 12. I'm there.

[03:03:06:21]
CC:  Okay Fred-o. On page 12, we want the [glossary:MSFN]
     updates. We've got some vectors for you and a
     [glossary:P30] pad. And we'll - when you get to that state,
     we'll let you know when we want to uplink. Okay.
     Under "[glossary:AGS] Activation and Self Test," perform
     the entire procedure. On page 13, under "AGS
     Aline," do step 1; under "[glossary:DAP] Set, Gimbal/Throttle
     Test," do step 1 with the following
     change. Under "THROTTLE CONTROL," we want it
     "AUTO." Over.

[03:03:07:13]
_page : 309
_tape : Tape 50/8
LMP: Okay. I'll catch up here. On page 12, you'll
     give us [glossary:MSFN] updates, some vectors, and a [glossary:P30];
     and we're to do the entire "[glossary:AGS] Activation and
     Self Test." On page 13, we'll do the "[glossary:AGS] Align"
     and under "[glossary:DAP] Set, Gimbal/Throttle Test,"
     step 1, I've changed "THROTTLE CONTROL MANUAL"
     to "THROTTLE CONTROL AUTO."

[03:03:07:43]
CC:  Good readback. Turning over to page 14, step 2,
     we want you to change the [glossary:DAP] [glossary:NOUN 46] to 31021.
     Then after the [glossary:NOUN 47], insert "[glossary:VERB 34], ENTER."
     Over.

[03:03:08:15]
LMP: Okay. On page 14, a [glossary:VERB 48], [glossary:DAP] load, [glossary:NOUN 46]
     changed to 31021. I assume you will give us any
     updated weights if we need any, and after the
     [glossary:NOUN 47], a "[glossary:VERB 34], ENTER." So, I - you're
     saying our gimbals look all right.

[03:03:08:35]
CC:  That's affirmative on the gimbals, Fred. Nothing
     else on page 14. Proceed to page 15, and under
     "[glossary:RCS] CHECKOUT," we'd like to scratch that wording
     and just say "Verify the following switches:
     GUIDANCE CONTROL, [glossary:PGNS];" step 3 - correction -
     it's line 3, change "ATTITUDE CONTROL (3)" to
     "MODE CONTROL;" "MODE CONTROL (BOTH)" to "AUTO."
     Verify ACA PROP, LMP ENABLE; ACA/4 JET, LMP
     ENABLE; [glossary:TTCA]/TRANSLATION, LMP, ENABLE. That is
     all on page 15. Over.

[03:03:09:45]
LMP: Okay. On page 15, we'll change the heading
     "[glossary:RCS] CHECKOUT" to "Verify following switches,"
     and those switches are "GUIDANCE CONTROL, [glossary:PGNS];"
     third line, "ATTITUDE CONTROL (3)" to "MODE
     CONTROL" now; and then "MODE CONTROL (BOTH)" to
     "AUTO" and ACA PROP, LMP ENABLE; ACA/4 JET, LMP
     ENABLE; and [glossary:TTCA]/TRANSLATION, LMP ENABLE.

[03:03:10:11]
CC:  Roger. Now stand by 1.

[03:03:10:17]
CDR: Okay. Hand me the eyepiece. I got Scorpio.

[03:03:10:22]
LMP: You have?

[03:03:10:23]
CDR: Yes. And Antares.

[03:03:10:30]
_page : 310
_tape : Tape 50/9
LMP: Where's the other one? I'll put it back in
     here.

[03:03:10:32]
CC:  Hello, Aquarius. Houston. On activation page 16,
     if you are ready. Over.

[03:03:10:41]
LMP: Okay. Stand by just 1, Charlie. Jim's going to
     fish around and see if he's got - he thinks he's
     got Scorpio. I'm the [glossary:AOT] now. Okay, Charlie,
     go ahead. I'm on 16 now.

[03:03:11:01]
CC:  Okay. Fred. On page 16, perform the "Docked
     [glossary:DPS] BURN (PGNS)," that entire sequence down -
     down through the end of the page, except cross
     out that "[glossary:CSM] Maneuver to Burn Attitude, then
     [glossary:CMC] - FREE." Over.

[03:03:11:27]
LMP: Yes. I kind of deduced that one, Charlie. Page 16, "Docked [glossary:DPS] BURN (PGNS)," except we'll
     forget the [glossary:CSM] maneuver.

[03:03:11:35]
CC:  Okay. And you can forget the "[glossary:APS] Follow-up,"
     too. Okay, on page 17, perform all of the [glossary:AGS]
     entries and at 4 minutes, we got a change.
     First line, CB(16) INVERTER 3, CLOSE; line 2,
     scratch out "Select INVERTER 1." At - proceeding
     on down the page, after "ATTITUDE MONITOR," we' d
     like you to place the RATE SCALE to "25 degrees
     a second." Okay, proceeding on down four more
     lines to "BALANCE COUPLE," we'd like to turn
     "BALANCE COUPLE-OFF." That's to keep the
     upfiring jets off of the [glossary:CSM], in case we have
     to damp any rates in [glossary:AGS], though we don't think
     we will. Then perform the rest of that page as
     written. Over.

[03:03:12:44]
LMP: Okay, on page 17. Do the [glossary:AGS] load at minus
     4 minutes; it's CB(11), INVERTER 2, CLOSE, and
     scratch "Select INVERTER 1." RATE SCALE changed
     to "25 degrees a second." "BALANCE COUPLE,"
     we'll turn "OFF;" and, incidentally, on the [glossary:AGS]
     dampen rates point, it brings up the discussion
     we'd had before, Charlie, on takeovers. You
     might discuss what it's going to cost us DELTA-V-wise, if we get a control problem, to just shut
     her off and it take 30 minutes to regroup for a
     good manual burn.

[03:03:13:26]
CC:  Fred, we already got that story for you, pretty
     well in hand. We're reviewing it right now.
     And I'd like to defer that question until later
     on. Basically, we're just going to shut down
     and take what we got, and we got a midcourse
     of about - the maximum of 5 foot per second,
     anywhere in the burn to get back to free return.
     That - that's basically the story. We'll give
     you the mission rules for this burn momentarily.
     I'd like to proceed on to page 18, at minus
     1 minute, scratch "MASTER ARM - ON." Stand by.

[03:03:14:07]
_page : 311
_tape : Tape 50/10
LMP: Okay, on page 18, and I've already done that at
     1 minute; "MASTER ARM - ON," I'll scratch - -

[03:03:14:14]
CDR: - - Slipped that ... and I won't have anything
     to do - -

[03:03:14:15]
LMP: - - I've already scratched "CB(16) ABORT STAGE -
     CLOSE" for the previous burn.

[03:03:14:20]
CC:  Okay. We want you to close the CB(16) ABORT
     STAGE. Over.

[03:03:14:33]
LMP: Okay. You got some special reason for that?

[03:03:14:36]
CC:  Yes, sir. We like - In case we don't get a
     manual ON - I mean, an AUTO ON, we're going to
     back up using the abort stage in the descent-engine command override at ignition plus 1 second.
     Backing up to page 17, at minus 4 minutes, you
     read "CB(11) INVERTER 2," it should be "CB(16)
     INVERTER 2." Over.

[03:03:15:03]
LMP: Okay, I got you, Charlie. 17, "CB(16) INVERTER 2,
     CLOSE."

[03:03:15:08]
CC:  Okay, back to page 18. We'll continue on as is
     at 30 seconds, 10 seconds, 7 seconds, minus
     5 seconds. At "ignition," no ignition and we'll
     add here, "no ignition, START pushbutton - push;
     still no ignition, DESCENT ENGINE COMMAND
     OVERRIDE, ON." Over.

[03:03:15:45]
CDR: I got it out there, but I can't get to see it
     closer.

[03:03:15:58]
LMP: Okay, on channel - on page 18, right on down the
     line, everything holds until after "ignition";
     "if no ignition, START pushbutton - push; still
     no ignition, DESCENT ENGINE COMMAND OVERRIDE
     switch ON."

[03:03:16:14]
_page : 312
_tape : Tape 50/11
CC:  Okay, good readback, Fred-o. At plus 15 seconds,
     scratch "MASTER ARM - OFF;" and at - proceeding
     on down to "At Engine Cutoff," it's - after the
     "MODE CONTROL: [glossary:PGNS] to ATT HOLD," we'd like a
     "[glossary:VERB 76]," and the "Damp Excessive Rates Via
     the [glossary:LM] Y, Z Translation." Over.

[03:03:16:48]
LMP: Okay, scratch "MASTER ARM - OFF" at plus 15, and
     "At Engine Cutoff" after "MODE CONTROL: [glossary:PGNS] -
     ATT HOLD," we want a "[glossary:VERB 76] ENTER," and "Damp
     Excessive rates Via [glossary:LM] Y, Z translation." And
     a question on the - propellant quantity, we expect
     it to get down below 37 percent on this burn.
     Does that compare with that burn time when you
     get down to it.

[03:03:17:16]
CC:  That's negative. At this - this burn, we're
     looking at - not reaching 37 percent, so I
     don't think we'll have to perform that step.
     We will verify that for you. Okay. One other
     statement: "At Engine Cutoff, if manual start,
     then at 30 feet per second to go, throttle to
     40 percent. At DELTA-V equals zero, stop pushbutton,
     push." Over.

[03:03:18:11]
LMP: Okay, Charlie. If a manual start, that was
     throttle to 40 percent at - Was that 30 foot
     per second to go?

[03:03:18:19]
CC:  That's affirmative. At 30 foot per second to go.

[03:03:18:30]
LMP: Okay. Then it's stop pushbutton at VGO equals
     zero?

[03:03:18:36]
CC:  That's affirmative. What we want to do, if we
     got a manual start, we're going to have to shut
     down manually, and, to get a better guided cut-off at 30 foot per second to go, we want you to
     throttle at 40 and acceleration is within reason
     there, and we feel like we can get a good manual
     cut-off. Over.

[03:03:18:56]
LMP: Okay.

[03:03:18:59]
CC:  Okay. Now, Fred, that was good in the checklist.
     That's all. We'll have the powerdown checklist
     for you momentarily, and we'd like to ask you
     if you plan to use the [glossary:DPS] burn card. If you
     do, we have some changes to that. Over.

[03:03:19:20]
_page : 313
_tape : Tape 50/12
LMP: Okay. Let me get ahold of this ... right now.

[03:03:19:26]
CC:  Let me know when you are ready to copy. Over.

[03:03:19:31]
LMP: I'm ready.

[03:03:19:32]
CC:  Okay. The first two lines are okay. CB - third
     line, CB(11) and (16): STAB/CONTROL, all CLOSED
     except CB(11) [glossary:AEA], OPEN; ABORT STAGE, OPEN;
     AELD, OPEN. CB(16) AELD, OPEN. Over.

[03:03:20:09]
LMP: Okay, on the [glossary:DPS] burn card, third line should
     read CB(11) and (16): STAB/CONTROL CBs all
     CLOSED, except CB(11) [glossary:AEA], OPEN; ABORT STAGE,
     OPEN; AELD, OPEN; CB (16) AELD, OPEN.

[03:03:20:25]
CC:  Okay. Good readback. Proceeding on down the
     page. "BALANCE COUPLE" switch, "BALANCE COUPLE
     OFF." Okay, down to the [glossary:TTCA] - it's the last
     line before minus 2 minutes - "[glossary:TTCA] COMMANDER
     THROTTLE, MINIMUM; LMP [glossary:TTCA] to JETS." At minus
     2 minutes, scratch "400 plus 1." At minus
     1 minute, scratch "MASTER ARM, ON." At minus
     10 seconds, add "MANUAL ULLAGE." At plus
     5 seconds, scratch "DESCENT ENGINE COMMAND
     OVERRIDE, ON;" add "[glossary:TTCA], 40 percent." Okay,
     the same comments apply about the manual start:
     "At the ignition time, if no start, manual START
     pushbutton, push; if still no start, DESCENT
     ENGINE COMMAND OVERRIDE, ON." And the same
     comments apply to shutting down at manual start.
     Over.

[03:03:21:54]
LMP: Okay. The same comments. I'll start at the top
     again here. Okay. "BALANCE COUPLE" should be
     changed to "OFF." Under [glossary:TTCA], it should be
     "LMP [glossary:TTCA]" to "JET." Scratch "400 plus 1" at
     minus 2; scratch "MASTER ARM, ON" at minus 1.
     Add at minus 10 seconds "MANUAL ULLAGE"; add
     ignition - can add the comment about "If no
     start, START pushbutton, push; still no start,
     DESCENT ENGINE COMMAND OVERRIDE, ON." At the
     plus 5-second point, scratch "DESCENT ENGINE
     COMMAND OVERRIDE, ON," and add "[glossary:TTCA] to
     40 percent," and the same comment applies at
     engine stop to perform.

[03:03:22:39]
CDR: We really don't use this card at that time.

[03:03:22:42]
_page : 314
_tape : Tape 50/13
CC:  Roger, Fred-o. Now we aren't - also at minus
     30 seconds, we aren't looking at an [glossary:AGS] burn so
     you can scratch "ABORT pushbutton, push," and at
     DELTA-V equal to zero, scratch "ABORT pushbutton,
     reset." Over.

[03:03:23:02]
LMP: Okay. Minus 30 for [glossary:AGS] burn, "ABORT pushbutton,
     push" is scratched, and at DELTA-V equals zero,
     "ABORT pushbutton, reset" is scratched.

[03:03:23:11]
CC:  Okay, you got it, babe. We'll have some mission
     rules for you momentarily, and the powerdown
     checklist and also a [glossary:PTC] setup. Over.

[03:03:23:24]
LMP: Okay.

[03:03:23:27]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[03:03:23:29]
CC:  Go ahead, Jim. Over.

[03:03:23:34]
CDR: Roger. Be advised I'm now seeing Antares and
     Nunki in the [glossary:AOT], and I just wanted to know
     whether you want me to try to do a [glossary:P52].

[03:03:23:48]
CC:  Roger. Stand by. We copy the stars you are
     seeing. Stand by on a [glossary:P52].

[03:03:23:56]
LMP: Not very far apart. Put the card back up, Jim - -

[03:03:24:01]
CDR: It's better than Antares and Shaula.

[03:03:24:05]
LMP: Yes. Sure is. That's right.

[03:03:24:16]
CDR: We got pretty good ... I'll do an AUTO [glossary:P52] to
     Antares. That's the way I'll get it up there.

[03:03:24:23]
CC:  Hey, Houston - correction - Aquarius, Houston.
     We're satisfied with our present alinement. We
     don't want you to waste any more [glossary:RCS] gas trying
     to do this [glossary:P52], and be advised you guys are hot
     mike, if you haven't heard. Over.

[03:03:24:44]
CDR: Okay, understand.

[03:03:24:47]
LMP: How's your memory there, Charlie?

[03:03:24:51]
CC:  Okay, we're putting Vance back on. Stand by.

[03:03:25:10]
CDR: What was that - -

[03:03:25:20]
_page : 315
_tape : Tape 50/14
CDR: Okay, okay, let's go back to that [glossary:P52] ... now the
     attitude.

[03:03:25:26]
LMP: The burn attitude?

[03:03:25:28]
CDR: Yes. I want to make sure I got it.

[03:03:25:30]
LMP: Oh, you strayed off?

[03:03:25:31]
CDR: Yes.

[03:03:25:34]
LMP: Okay. ... Okay. You want these numbers? Or
     do you want the numbers from these.

[03:03:25:47]
CDR: What?

[03:03:25:48]
LMP: Pads. You got the G&N dictionary?

[03:03:25:51]
CDR: I got 13 20 going now.

[03:03:25:57]
LMP: Wait a minute.

[03:03:26:10]
CDR: ... Just a ... These are those 13 20 angles
     here. Up here. Right here.

[03:03:26:56]
CDR: Hey, great.

[03:03:27:20]
LMP: One on. And Houston, Aquarius.

[03:03:27:27]
CC:  Go ahead, Fred.

[03:03:27:32]
LMP: Oh, about how long we got before we're going to
     have to go to work here, Vance. Kind of like
     to get a bite to eat, maybe.

[03:03:27:40]
CC:  Okay. We have a - a couple of pads to give you
     and stand by. Let's - we'll check to see if we
     have anything else.

[03:03:27:56]
LMP: Hold on to that, baby. Where's that G&N book?
     You got it over there?

[03:03:28:02]
CDR: Here we go. Here, you want me to start
     copying - -

[03:03:28:06]
LMP: - - ... the bag - -

[03:03:28:07]
CDR: - - off there.

[03:03:28:09]

LMP: No, you've got it right here.

[03:03:28:14]
CDR: Go ahead.

[03:03:28:15]
CC:  Okay. About all we have to do is to send up
     your state vectors and target loads, and that
     will have to wait a couple of minutes until we
     get ready to do so. And if you're ready to
     copy, I can give you the [glossary:P30] maneuver pad for
     PC plus 2, and after that, probably you should
     eat and then we'll regroup again to send up
     other things. Over.

[03:03:28:45]
LMP: Okay. I'm ready to copy a [glossary:P30], a PC plus 2.

[03:03:28:49]
CC:  Okay. Okay, this is a preliminary [glossary:P30] [glossary:LM]
     maneuver PC plus 2. Starting [glossary:NOUN 33]:

CDR: What kind of a maneuver pad do you want, Vance?

[03:03:33:54]
CC:  This is a [glossary:CSM] maneuver pad for - to monitor
     PC plus 2. And it's going to be mainly blank
     except I want to give you your [glossary:NOUN 61] latitude
     and longitude range to go for the [glossary:EMS] and that
     sort of thing.

[03:03:34:15]
LMP: Okay, go ahead.

[03:03:34:18]
CC:  Okay, at the top, purpose is monitor PC plus 2;
     everything is blank until you get down to
     [glossary:NOUN 61]. Latitude as follows: minus 21.47,
     minus 165.00; 1166.0, 36291, [time:05:22:39:20|142:39:20]. Over.

[03:03:35:07]
LMP: Okay, monitor PC plus 2 pad. [glossary:NOUN 81]: minus
     21.47, minus 165.00; 1166.0, 36291, [time:05:22:39:20|142:39:20].

[03:03:35:28]
CC:  Roger; that's correct, Fred-o. And we - now
     would like to get you in a configuration to
     uplink your state vector and target load. So,
     if you're ready to copy, I have some circuit
     breaker changes for you. Over.

[03:03:35:47]
LMP: Okay, go ahead.

[03:03:35:50]
CC:  Okay, circuit breaker panel 11 UPDATA LINK,
     CLOSE; PRIMARY POWER AMPL, panel 16, CLOSE;
     VOICE FUNCTION to VOICE; RANGE - RANGING FUNCTION
     to RANGING; TM bit rate, HI; and then [glossary:P00] and
     DATA.

[03:03:36:28]
LMP: Okay, we're now in [glossary:P00] and DATA, and switches
     and breakers are configured. You got it.

[03:03:36:32]
CC:  Okay, thank you. You're coming in loud and
     clear.

[03:03:43:36]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[03:03:43:42]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[03:03:43:44]
CC:  Hey, Jim, I have about three things. First thing,
     the computer is yours again. The second thing,
     no [glossary:PTC] maneuvering will be required from now
     until burn, so you can just sit in the burn
     attitude. And the third thing is we'd like to
     back out of this procedure we just put you into
     to updata link, which would mean going from TM
     bit rate HI back to LO, RANGING to OFF, VOICE
     to DOWN VOICE, PRIMARY POWER AMPL to CLOSE.

[03:03:44:25]

[03:03:44:38]
CC:  Stand by - -

[03:03:44:39]
LMP: - - that high bit rate.

[03:03:44:49]
LMP: Okay, that apparently was just my putting the
     UPDATA LINK switch OFF that set that bit.

[03:03:44:54]
CC:  Roger. We concur on that. And I'll read this
     back to you a little more slowly, Fred.

[03:03:45:05]
CC:  Okay, are you ready to copy?

[03:03:45:06]
LMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[03:03:45:07]
CC:  Okay. TM bit rate to LO; RANGING to OFF,
     VOICE to DOWN VOICE, PRIMARY POWER AMPL to off -
     that's on panel 16 - and - or OPEN - and circuit
     breaker 11 UPDATA LINK to CLOSE - or to OPEN.
     Over.

[03:03:46:16]
LMP: Okay, Vance, how do you read on DOWN VOICE
     BACKUP now?

[03:03:46:20]
CC:  Okay, Fred, reading you loud and clear now.

[03:03:46:26]
LMP: Okay. I've got the POWER AMPL off, DOWN VOICE
     BACKUP, PCM to LO bit rate, and the UPDATA LINK
     breaker on 11 is pulled.

[03:03:46:47]
CC:  Okay. Copy. Thank you.

[03:03:47:22]

     to verify that the PRIMARY POWER AMPL was pulled
     opened. Over.

[03:03:47:37]
LMP: That's affirm. I used the breaker on 16,
     PRIMARY S-BAND POWER AMPL breaker is OPEN.

     amassing a couple of - list of things that you
     were thinking about later on - we'd be taking
     back from the [glossary:LM] across into the [glossary:CSM]. A couple
     of items to add to that list, we've pilfered the -
     the intake hose screens out of the [glossary:CSM] and we
     have them mounted on the [glossary:LM] hoses now to catch
     the debris in here. We probably ought to take
     those back.

[03:04:22:22]
CC: Jim, we were just discussing burn star monitoring
     and we were curious to know if you can see
     Nunki in detent 2 at this time. Over.

[03:04:22:45]
CDR: That's affirmative. I can see Nunki in detent 2.

[03:04:22:49]
CC:  Okay. Thank you. Roughly, in what part of the
     field of view?

[03:04:23:01]
CDR: Nunki is in the upper right-hand corner.

[03:04:23:05]
CC:  Okay. Thank you.

[03:04:23:10]
CDR: And Scorp - And Antares is barely visible in the
     bottom of the field of view.

[03:04:23:17]
CC:  Okay.

[03:04:24:24]
CMP: ...

[03:04:24:39]
CDR: Hey, I bet I know how I could get an alinement.
     Give them a cursor spiral angle. Instead of
     maneuvering the spacecraft, I'll give them
     cursor spiral.

[03:04:24:58]
LMP: Do that for [glossary:AGS] and ...

[03:04:25:09]
LMP: ... How's the ...?

[03:04:27:17]
CDR: Houston, for what it's worth, we can probably
     give you a cursor spiral angle on Nunki and
     possibly Antares or more than likely Shaula.

[03:04:27:34]
CC:  Roger, Jim. According to our calculations,
     Nunki should be, at burn time, pretty close to
     the center of the [glossary:AOT]. We've been talking that
     possibility over.

[03:04:27:50]
CDR: Roger.

[03:04:27:55]
CC:  Also, as a matter of general interest, the Sun
     should be in - at the bottom part of the CDR's

[03:04:29:51]
CC:  Jim, whenever you're through eating and ready
     to copy the info, I can send you the burn rules.

[03:04:30:05]
LMP: Do you want this?

[03:04:30:08]
CMP: Write them right on - ...?

[03:04:30:10]
CDR: Why don't you write them right in here?

[03:04:30:12]
LMP: Okay.

[03:04:30:22]
LMP: Okay. I'll start on that.

[03:04:30:25]
CDR: Okay, Vance.

[03:04:30:27]
LMP: Go ahead.

[03:04:30:28]
CDR: We're all set to go.

[03:04:30:31]
CC:  Okay. Okay. First of all, general philosophy
     is that these rules should be similar to [glossary:LOI] mode I
     abort with the tight limits. Now, I'll go through
     them one by one for you to copy. Okay. You
     should shut down, if any of the following happen.
     Thrust monitor readout, 77 percent or below;
     [glossary:DPS] propellant tank pressure - that's the inlet
     pressure - onboard readout, 160 or below; fuel
     to OX DELTA-P, greater than 25 psi - and that would
     have to be a ground call to you - attitude error
     plus or minus 10 degrees, with the exception
     of the start transient; attitude-rate limits,
     plus or minus 10 degrees a second. And you
     should shut down if you get any of the following
     alarms: ENGINE GIMBAL, ISS, plus PROGRAM ALARM,
     [glossary:LGC], CES DC, and if you get an inverter light
     after switching inverters. Are you with me?

[03:04:32:52]
LMP: Roger.

[03:04:32:54]
_page : 326
_tape : Tape 51/7
CC:  Okay. - -

[03:04:32:55]
CDR: Affirmative.

[03:04:32:57]
CC:  And proceeding on. If, during the burn, the
     engine stops, if you have a flashing NOUN 97,
     you should PROCEED, then ullage, ENGINE START
     to PUSH, and DESCENT ENGINE OVERRIDE ON. Okay.
     Now just general information. If you didn't
     burn PC plus 2, probably P - P plus 4 would be
     the earliest [glossary:MCC]. [glossary:AGS] is going to backup in
     a rate-fail mode only, which you know. We're
     talking over the star check. Will have to get
     back with you on that. If, for some reason,
     there is no PC-2, you have a free-return trajectory with the landing at 152:02:00, and that
     would be after a small midcourse-5, which would
     probably be around 4 feet per second at 93 hours.
     And you have recovery forces in the Indian Ocean;
     you're in good shape there. And the Indian
     Ocean is where this landing would be. Okay.
     You still with me?

[03:04:35:13]
LMP: Roger.

[03:04:35:15]
CC:  Okay. After - -

[03:04:35:17]
LMP: Yes. I'm with you.

[03:04:35:19]
CC:  Okay. After PC plus 2, there are no trim requirements; and, if you have a shutdown during
     PC plus 2, subsequent midcourse maneuvers required
     with - Well, the earliest one would be PC plus 4.
     If you don't do a PC plus 2, but we still want to
     do one - [glossary:MCC] later. At PC plus 4, the increase
     in DELT - in DELTA-V, or the penalty, would be
     about 24 feet per second, with a landing in the
     mid-Pacific at [time:05:22:46:30|142:46:30]. Now, you should expect new pads, state vectors, and targets for
     PC plus 2 at about [glossary:GET] 78. Over.

[03:04:36:56]
CMP: Tell them to stand by.

[03:04:36:57]
LMP: Stand by, Vance.

[03:04:36:58]
CC:  Okay.

[03:04:37:07]
LMP: Okay. How do you read?

[03:04:37:09]
CC:  Loud and clear.

[03:04:37:13]
_page : 327
_tape : Tape 51/8
LMP: Okay. Burn rules. We should shut down for the
     following: if we have the thrust monitor at
     77 percent or below; number 2, if the [glossary:DPS] propellant ullage pressure is less than 160 psi;
     3, if the fuel oxidizer DELTA-P is greater than
     25, and that'll be a ground callout; 4, if the
     attitude error is plus or minus 10 degrees except for starting transients. Okay. Rate limits
     are plus or minus 10 degrees per second. And
     we're to shut down with the following alarms:
     an ENGINE GIMBAL light, an ISS with a PROGRAM
     ALARM, an [glossary:LGC], a CES DC, and an inverter light,
     if it's still on after we've tried switching
     inverters. If, during the burn, the engine shuts
     down when the NOUN 97 flashes, we should PRO, do
     manual ullage, and START pushbutton, push, and
     DESCENT ENGINE COMMAND OVERRIDE, open. If we
     don't do a PC-2, our next burn will it be at PC-4
     for an added 24 foot per second. We'll land mid-PAC at [time:05:22:46:30|142:46:30]. Okay. We'll have the [glossary:AGS] up
     for backup rate command, or rate damping, I
     guess. And the free return that we're on, if
     we don't - that we're on now, if we don't do
     PC-2 or 4, lands us at 152:02:00 in the Indian
     Ocean. And there's no trim requirements on this
     burn, and we should expect a new uplink and a new
     final maneuver pad from you at 178 hours.

[03:04:39:23]
CC:  78.

[03:04:39:29]
LMP: Okay. I'm sorry, 1 - Yes, 78 hours. It only
     seems like it's been that long.

[03:04:39:35]
CC:  I can understand.

[03:04:39:54]
CC:  Okay, Fred. Your readback was correct.

[03:04:40:00]
LMP: Okay.

[03:04:40:16]
LMP: Okay. And, Vance, did you ever have any [glossary:LOS]/AOS
     times, and - and a startup time for us to jump
     into this activation checklist?

[03:04:40:29]
CC:  Okay. Let me - Let me poll the house again on
     that one.

[03:04:40:37]
CDR: What?

[03:04:40:39]
LMP: Okay. One word is that the - In an optimum
     fashion there, going through that 2-hour activation generally took sonewhere from about an hour
     and 15 to an hour 20.

[03:04:40:56]
_page : 328
_tape : Tape 51/9
CC: Okay. I guess then we ought to allow you a
     little more than that, huh?

[03:04:41:06]
LMP: No, I was thinking that we don't have to do about
     four pages of it, that we probably need just about
     that, and that will make up for the difference of
     any added time we need maneuvering et cetera.

[03:04:41:19]
CC:  Okay.

[03:04:42:07]
CDR: We'll need a - Can I get a flashlight? You got
     a flashlight. We might need a spare flashlight -
     Yes. Okay. We might need a spare flashlight:
     have you got one? Okay. Okay. The Sun has
     gone ... down.

[03:04:42:31]
CDR: Man, look at those stars. Houston.

[03:04:42:40]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[03:04:42:45]
CDR: Roger. We are in the shadow of the Moon now.
     The Sun is just about set as far as I can see
     and the stars are all coming out.

[03:04:42:54]
CC:  Okay. And if you are ready to copy, we have
     [glossary:LOS]/[glossary:AOS] times for you.

[03:04:43:04]
CMP: Flashlight. Okay.

[03:04:43:16]
LMP: Go ahead, Vance.

[03:04:43:18]
CC:  Okay. [glossary:LOS] [time:03:05:08:35|77:08:35], [glossary:AOS] [time:03:05:33:10|77:33:10]. Sunrise -
     First I'll give you sunset which is past, but that
     was supposed to be at [time:03:04:32:45|76:32:45] and sunrise
     [time:03:05:16:48|77:16:48].

[03:04:43:58]
LMP: Okay. [glossary:LOS] at [time:03:05:08:35|77:08:35], [glossary:AOS] at [time:03:05:33:10|77:33:10]. Sunset
     at [time:03:04:32:45|76:32:45], sunrise at [time:03:05:16:48|77:16:48].

[03:04:44:13]
CC:  Roger. We'll get back with you on the powerup
     time and, if you're ready to copy, have angles
     to load into [glossary:NOUN 22] for your [glossary:VERB 49] maneuver
     to burn attitude. Over.

[03:04:44:35]
LMP: Okay. Go ahead with the VERB 49 value.

CC:  Okay. R<sub>1</sub> plus 27210, R<sub>2</sub> plus 35570, R<sub>3</sub> plus
     33010. Second item, as you know, due to maneuver
     with a PROCEED and a PROCEED; and, after your
     attitude, a reminder that [glossary:P40] will not set you
     back to a narrow deadband. To get back to the
     1.40-degree deadband, you have to use the procedure I gave you, which is [glossary:VERB 21], NOUN 01,
     ENTER, 3011, ENTER. And 200, ENTER.

[03:04:45:47]

_tape : Tape 51/10
LMP: Okay. [glossary:VERB 49], register 1, plus 27218; register 2, plus 35570; register 3, plus 33010; and
     to get the narrow deadband back we want a
     [glossary:VERB 21], NOUN 01, ENTER, 3011, ENTER, 200 ENTER.

[03:04:46:11]
CC:  Roger. And a correction on your - on your first
     number for register 1. That should be plus 27210.
     And another comment; after you get into the
     narrow deadband at that attitude, why, you might
     tell us where you see Nunki.

[03:04:46:34]
CDR: Roger. Will do, Vance.

[03:04:46:36]
CC:  Thank you.

[03:04:46:37]
LMP: Okay. And you corrected register 1; it's
     plus 27210.

[03:04:46:43]
CC:  Roger.

[03:04:46:45]
CDR: And would you like us to make that maneuver at
     this time?

[03:04:47:10]

[03:04:47:13]

     coming from around those clouds.

[03:04:48:48]

CC:  Apollo 13, Houston.

[03:04:50:05]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[03:04:50:08]
CC:  Jim, we recommend you go ahead and make your
     [glossary:VERB 49] maneuver, but just stay there in VERB 49
     and don't go ahead to narrow the deadband just
     yet. And, when you're in that attitude, why,
     of course, then you can make your star check.
     And one other item is, I don't think we got back
     with you, but that hour 15 for powerup sounds
     fine with us.

[03:04:50:40]
CDR: Okay. At this time, I'll start my [glossary:VERB 49]
     maneuver, but will not narrow the deadband, and
     we will take a look at Nunki. Okay, Vance.

[03:04:50:52]

     much better.

[03:04:55:48]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[03:04:55:55]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.

[03:04:56:00]
CDR: Okay. We have completed our maneuver. We're
     in our wide deadband, and Nunki is close to the
     top of my display of the [glossary:AOT]. Right now, Antares
     seems to be more closer towards the center.
     However, we are in our wide deadband.

[03:04:57:18]
CC:  Right; understand. We'll have to make a better
     check later, I guess.

[03:04:57:26]
CDR: I can't for the life of me figure out what that
     dark stuff is.

[03:04:57:38]

     10 hours.

[03:04:58:29]
CMP: Yes.

[03:04:58:32]
LMP: And how.

[03:04:58:54]
CDR: Might be a good idea.

[03:04:59:41]

     locate it and get it halfway through the ...

[03:05:03:08]

     that was thrown out there.

[03:05:03:15]
CMP: - - into the cloud?

[03:05:03:19]
LMP: It's all dark now.

[03:05:03:24]
CDR: From the explosion.

[03:05:03:27]
LMP: ... we made a maneuver.

[03:05:03:30]
CDR: No, from our explosion.

[03:05:03:32]
CMP: Take a look. It covers a wide area. God, that
     dark cloud. ... Like a pair of contrails. Only
     if you switch the detent, they go on around.
     How long to [glossary:LOS]? Is that right?

[03:05:04:06]

     our damn platform's okay, isn't it?

     start our activations until we receive [glossary:AOS] from

[03:05:45:10]
CC:  Jim, regarding the start time for the powerup,
     you mentioned an hour and 15 minutes. We think
     that is adequate. This is crew preference depending on how much time you think you need. We
     would go along with an hour and 15 minutes - -

[03:05:45:46]

[03:05:52:43]

[03:05:52:46]
CC:  Okay, Jim. We have about three items for you.
     We have a maneuver pad, [glossary:P30] [glossary:LM] maneuver, again;
     and the maneuver pad for the [glossary:CM] for splashdown.
     We also have a checklist change with contingencies, - [glossary:LM] contingencies checklist. And, I'll
     stand by while you're gathering the books.

[03:05:53:15]
LMP: Okay. I'm at - I got the contingency book, so
     give me that one first.

[03:05:53:20]
CC:  Okay. Page 18 ...

[03:05:53:26]
CDR: Okay. I'm at page 18.

[03:05:53:28]
CC:  Okay. About half-way down. When propellant
     quantity equals 30 percent, or rather 37 percent,
     we would like to change that line to read - when
     time to go is equal to 10 seconds - Of course,
     the line under that remains the same then,
     DESCENT HE REG 1 to CLOSE.

[03:05:53:58]
CDR: Okay. When time to go equals 10 seconds, DESCENT
     HELIUM REG 1, CLOSE.

[03:05:54:05]
CC:  That's affirm. Before I start on the pads,
     another comment. The general indications that
     we gave you before about the Sun being in the
     commander's window and about stars in the [glossary:AOT],
     such as that might be used as general indication
     for your attitude for the burn, that's all out
     the window. We are just going on the Sun check
     that we made earlier and we don't feel that we
     have information that is good enough to give you
     the star and the Sun in the window information.

[03:05:54:58]

[03:05:55:05]

     to take the [glossary:P30] [glossary:LM] maneuver pad, I'll be reading
     it up.

[03:05:58:30]

     1 by 1 now. Advise that I heard everything except the beginning [glossary:NOUN 33] values and the comments. Please repeat the readback on those.

     minus 165.00, 1163.5, 36292, [time:05:22:39:22|142:39:22].

[03:06:02:06]
CC:  Roger. That was starting with [glossary:NOUN 61], and that's
     correct.

[03:06:02:25]
CC:  By the way, Aquarius, we see the results now
     from 12's seismometer. Looks like your booster
     just hit the Moon, and it's rocking it a little
     bit. Over.

[03:06:02:44]
CMP: Well, at least something worked on this flight.

[03:06:03:00]
CC:  And I just want to verify one thing, we could - -

[03:06:03:02]
CMP: Yes, I'm sure - -

[03:06:03:03]
CC:  - - Go ahead.

[03:06:03:09]
CMP: I say I'm sure glad we didn't have a [glossary:LM] impact,
     too.

[03:06:03:16]
CC:  Right. Just wanted to verify - We had poor
     reception when I was talking to you before - I
     wanted to verify that you understand that the
     Sun check you made earlier in the [glossary:AOT] was good,
     and that's what we're riding on. Anything that
     we told you in the past about looking at the Sun
     in the front left window or looking at stars,
     like Nunki through the [glossary:AOT], why, we want to
     forget.

[03:06:03:50]
CDR: Roger. Understand, Vance. I think Nunki would
     be kind of hard to see anyway with the Moon right
     here.

[03:06:03:58]
CC:  Right.

[03:06:04:27]
CDR: And, Vance, we plan to start powering up at [time:03:06:12:00|78:12].
     Is that a good time or do you think we ought to
     hold off a little longer?

[03:06:04:46]
CC:  Jim, we think that's very good.

[03:06:04:53]
CDR: Right.

CC:  Fred, after the burn, we'll get the powerdown
     instructions, or checklist changes to you. At
     the same time, we'd like to get a consumables
     status to you. All I'll say right now is that
     we think you look in reasonably good shape.

[03:06:08:52]
CMP: Okay. Very good.

[03:06:09:46]
CMP: Okay. Houston, Aquarius.

[03:06:09:48]
CC:  Go ahead.

[03:06:09:52]
CMP: Okay. One CAUTION AND WARNING light here showing
     that you didn't call out - it's the PRE AMPS - I
     suppose because we don't have the ATCA breaker in
     yet.

[03:06:10:08]
CC:  Okay. That's okay.

[03:06:17:38]
CDR: Houston, are you planning to give us a state
     vector update.

[03:06:18:04]
CC:  That's - That's affirm, Jim. All we need is
     UPDATA LINK circuit breaker closed on panel 11,
     and [glossary:P00] and ACCEPT and we can ship it up to you.
     [glossary:P00] and DATA.

[03:06:18:32]
CDR: Okay, Vance. We're in DATA and [glossary:P00] and the
     circuit breaker's in. Go ahead.

[03:06:18:39]
CC:  Okay. We'll ship her up to you.

[03:06:21:45]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[03:06:21:53]

[03:06:21:54]

     in RANGING. We need that, if it's not there now.

[03:06:22:14]

[03:06:22:15]
CC:  Thank you.

[03:06:23:05]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. The computer is yours.

[03:06:28:15]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Did you call?

[03:06:28:22]

CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[03:06:29:48]
LMP: Houston, are you calling Aquarius?

[03:06:29:51]
CC:  Roger, Fred. I would like to confirm that you
     are getting drinking water out of, potable water
     out of the command module and, if you can make
     any estimates of how much you use as time goes
     on, and how much you have used, we would appreciate it for our consumables analysis.

[03:06:30:12]
LMP: Okay.

[03:06:30:26]
LMP: Okay, Jack. Tried the procedure and out of that
     pressure, we got 10 drinks made. That's roughly
     80 ounces.

[03:06:30:56]
CC:  Okay, Fred, we had a little static on that one,
     but I think you said that 80 ounces of water
     has been used out of the [glossary:CM]. Is that right?

[03:06:31:08]
LMP: Yes. Jack worked the procedure and filled as
     many of the drinks as he could, and he made up
     ten bags of approximately 8 ounces a bag.

[03:06:31:23]
CC:  Okay. We copy that.

[03:06:36:06]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[03:06:36:14]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[03:06:36:16]
CC:  Jim, just a bit of information, if for any reason
     you had to slip [glossary:Tig|T<sub>ig</sub>], our people here feel it
     wouldn't do much harm if you slipped it up to
     30 minutes. The procedure, of course as you
     know, is not to PRO on the flashing 99 and we
     thought you might like to be aware that [glossary:Tig|T<sub>ig</sub>] time
     isn't all that critical.

[03:06:36:43]
CDR: Roger. Understand.

[03:06:41:07]
LMP: Okay, Vance; Aquarius.

[03:06:41:10]
CC:  Go, Fred.

[03:06:41:15]
LMP: Okay. I think it's finally coming through to us
     here, what you said just a little while ago.
     Were you suggesting that we move the [glossary:Tig|T<sub>ig</sub>] up
     30 minutes?

[03:06:41:25]
_page : 340
_tape : Tape 52/8
CC:  No, not at all. We're just giving you excess
     information. Just saying if you had any problem
     at all it could be slipped.

[03:06:41:38]
LMP: Oh, okay. Slipped 30 minutes. Okay. That's
     better.

[03:06:41:42]
CC:  Right.

[03:06:41:55]
CC:  You guys are pretty fast, though.

[03:06:42:05]
LMP: Yes. It kind of surprised us.

[03:06:42:08]
CC:  I guess that's what happens when you cut a lot
     out of a checklist.

[03:06:42:14]
LMP: Yes. Yes, we're taking about a thousand pictures
     in between steps there, too.

[03:06:45:33]
LMP: Okay, Houston; Aquarius, radio check.

[03:06:45:39]
CC:  Loud and clear, Fred.

[03:06:45:43]
LMP: Okay. I had a change in the background noises,
     wondered if you were still there.

[03:07:06:31]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. We have some new information
     regarding what you should see out the commander's
     window at [glossary:Tig|T<sub>ig</sub>] Over.

[03:07:06:44]
CDR: Okay. Go ahead.

[03:07:06:48]
CC:  According to calculations - calculations, you
     should see the Moon. It'll be a full Moon. You
     should see most of the disk and it should be somewhere on your vertical [glossary:LPD] line, probably at about
     14 on the [glossary:LPD] scale. Over. Roughly centered on 14.

[03:07:07:38]
CDR: Okay, Houston. I concur. I'm looking at 14 on the
     [glossary:LPD] and the angle is just about centered. It's
     south of Crisium, but its - The line is just
     slightly to the north of center.

[03:07:08:08]
CC:  Okay, Jim. That sounds very good. We see that
     you have a slight yaw angle, so it should be north
     of center.

[03:07:08:48]
CDR: I can even see Mount Marilyn from here.

[03:07:18:07]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[03:07:18:13]

CC:  Or that was - Stand by.

[03:07:24:24]

[03:07:24:26]
CC:  Stand by. That was incorrect. Three minutes -
     Counting down to 3 minutes, and I'll give you a

     breakers you want us to power down. As you did yesterday, for us.

[03:07:34:09]
CC:  Okay. We have a procedure ready to send up to
     you here in about 2 minutes. Let us know when you're all ready to take it.

[03:07:34:18]
CDR: Okay.

[03:07:34:23]
LMP: Okay. Is it going to be better to write this
     on a blank page, Vance, or can we use some portion
     of the powerdown list there in the contingency
     book that already exists.

[03:07:34:33]
CC:  Stand by 1.

[03:07:36:03]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[03:07:36:07]
CDR: Go ahead.

[03:07:36:08]
CC:  Slight delay here, Jim. It will be a couple of
     minutes before we read that up to you, and we're
     looking at the contingency checklist powerdown
     and that's on page 5. You might be getting that
     out while we get all ready to give it to you.

[03:07:37:03]
LMP: Could you give us that page number again. Page 5
     doesn't make sense.

[03:07:37:14]
CC:  Okay. Make that power 5 in the contingency
     checklist, Fred. And it's the - -

[03:07:37:24]
LMP: - - that's better.

[03:07:37:25]
CC:  - - middle part of the page, it starts emergency
     powerdown, and we'll mark that up.

[03:07:37:42]
LMP: Okay. I'm to 5 emergency powerdown.

[03:07:37:48]
CC:  Okay. But hold off on it because we might have
     to start [glossary:PTC] up again here. And that's the point
     that's being resolved right at the moment, so
     stand by.

[03:07:38:02]

CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[03:07:42:25]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[03:07:42:26]
CC:  Okay. We're ready to give you the procedure
     which will power you down a good bit, and
     after the [glossary:PTC] is going, maybe we can give you
     further information, are you ready to copy?
     Starting at the middle of the page, power 5.

[03:07:42:48]
LMP: Okay. Go ahead, Vance.

[03:07:42:51]
CC:  Okay. After number 1, first line, cross out
     "And VHF-A." Second line, cross out "SIMPLEX
     operation." Third line, cross out "Prime."
     That refers to PRIME POWER AMP, OFF. That -
     that "PRIME" should actually be replaced by
     OFF. And that's the second prime that line.
     Also in the third line the last word "OFF"
     should be crossed out and replaced by "PCM."
     Fourth line is okay. Fifth line, which is
     "VHF VOICE, ON, OFF, OFF," cross out. "Lighting,
     FLOODS," which is the next line should be "OFF",
     but add the following, "Or OVERHEAD/FORWARD
     prefer OFF." Okay. Step 2 remains the same;
     no change for the moment. Stand by. Skip
     step 2. Do not do it. Just go on to step 3,
     which is "Configure circuit breakers per the
     chart." That takes us to page power 6. Why
     don't you give me a readback on what you had
     on power 5, Fred-o.

[03:07:44:48]
LMP: Okay. On power 5, emergency powerdown. Item 1,
     first line, I scratch the "And VHF-A." Second
     line "SIMPLEX operation." Third line, I replace
     the second prime which is the POWER AMP with an
     "OFF," and the last word in that line is "OFF,"
     replaced it with "PCM." Fourth line is okay.
     Fifth line, I scratch the whole line. Lighting,
     we haven't needed floods yet so we will just leave
     them off, exterior lighting off. Scratch line 2
     and I am now on power 6, wait for your update on
     the CB panels.

[03:07:45:31]
CC:  Okay. Power 6. Okay. Power 6 refers to panel 11.
     You should go per the chart with the exception of
     those breakers that I call out. First line is
     okay. Or, let's say, first row. Second row,
     QUAD 4, TCA, closed; QUAD 3, TCA, closed; QUAD 2,
     TCA, closed; and QUAD 1, TCA, closed. The rest
     of that row is okay. Row 3, about halfway over,
     ATCA (PGNS), closed. Okay. The rest of that
     line is okay. Fourth line, HEATER - stand by.
     Okay. That line is all okay with the exception
     of the last three circuit breakers, Fred, under
     [glossary:PGNS], which is [glossary:LGC] [glossary:DSKY], [glossary:IMU] STANDBY, [glossary:IMU]
     OPERATE. Those three should be closed, at least
     for the time being. And finally, the fifth line;
     it's okay as is. And would you give me a readback on that?

[03:07:47:35]
_page : 345
_tape : Tape 53/5
LMP: Okay. I disagree on the fifth line. It appears
     that we ought to have the ASCENT ECA CONTROL
     open.

[03:07:47:49]
CC:  Okay. We'll check into that one and while we
     are listening to the rest of your readout.

[03:07:47:57]
LMP: Okay. And top row is correct as is. Second row
     we want the QUAD TCAs 1 through 4 closed. On the
     third row, we want the ATCA (PGNS), closed. On
     the fourth row we want the [glossary:PGNS] [glossary:LGC] [glossary:DSKY], [glossary:IMU]
     STANDBY, [glossary:IMU] OPERATE, all closed, and you're
     saying the bottom row as is.

[03:07:48:23]
CC:  Okay. We'll go along with what you said on the
     ASCENT ECA CONTROL. That should be open.

[03:07:48:38]
CDR: Okay. Continue, Vance.

[03:07:48:41]
CC:  Okay. Next page, power 7, panel 16. First row,
     close the four QUAD TCA circuit breakers, that is,
     QUAD 1, TCA; QUAD 2, QUAD 3, and QUAD 4 TCA. Okay.
     Rows 2, 3, and 4 are okay.

[03:07:49:17]
LMP: Okay. Panel 16, top row, we want to close QUAD 1
     through 4 TCA breakers, and you're saying the other
     three rows are as is. Again, I have the exception
     the ASCENT ECA CONTROL on 16 should also be open.

[03:07:49:35]
CC:  Okay. We concur on that, and we have a late arrival 
     in row 3. Stand by.

[03:07:49:52]
CC:  Okay, Fred. One addition, third row. The S-BAND
     POWER AMP. Request that you pull that circuit
     breaker and leave the switch in PRIMARY.

[03:07:50:10]
_page : 346
_tape : Tape 53/6
LMP: Okay. Yes, that's the way we were doing it
     before. I'll pull the POWER AMP CB, and then
     I'll go back to the first stage and put the
     POWER AMP to PRIME.

[03:07:50:22]
CC:  That's correct; that should be changed back to
     PRIME. And that's - that's it.

[03:07:50:42]
CDR: Good work, Vance.

[03:07:50:46]
CC:  Thank you.

[03:07:51:00]
LMP: RESET, OFF and LOW. Okay. Lighting bus off;
     EXTERIOR LIGHTING is off. Okay. You want to
     get your breakers, Jim? We ought to probably
     go back to that wide deadband.

[03:07:51:24]
CDR: Okay. The BUS TIE INVERTERs are coming off the
     line.

[03:07:51:28]
CMP: Yes. Go ahead. Sorry, I put the switch off,
     that'll kill caution and warning.

[03:07:52:02]
CDR: Okay. Let's see. So we're going to lose the
     ball again.

[03:07:52:06]
CMP: Yes.

[03:07:52:11]
LMP: I'll get 16 [glossary:NOUN 20] out.

[03:07:52:53]
CDR: Do you have me move AUTO TRANSFER this time?

[03:07:53:07]
CDR: Why do I still have a VHF-A receiver off?

[03:07:53:13]
CMP: You don't, do you?

[03:07:53:15]
CDR: Yes.

[03:07:53:16]
CDR: Let's give them a call, panel 11.

[03:07:53:19]
LMP: Okay, Vance. I'm on - Do you read me now, hot
     mike?

[03:07:53:23]
CC:  Roger. Loud and clear, Fred.

[03:07:53:26]
LMP: Okay. Jim just noticed we got a VHF breaker in
     on panel 11 still, I think, that probably should be opened.

[03:07:53:41]
CC:  Okay. That's affirmative. Pull the VHF-A
     receiver.

[03:07:53:54]
_page : 347
_tape : Tape 53/7
LMP: Okay. Pull it, Jim.

[03:07:53:55]
CDR: I got it already. Okay. Now, why are we putting
     the cabin fan on?

[03:07:54:06]
CDR: Oh, oh, oh. Oh, yes. Okay.

[03:07:54:23]
CDR: Okay. I'm going to pull inverter 1.

[03:07:54:24]
LMP: Okay. Not very long since they had the switch off
     on you, anyway.

[03:07:54:31]
CDR: Okay.

[03:07:54:32]
LMP: Roger. - -

[03:07:54:33]
CDR: - - but my only question is, I got the CROSS TIE
     BUS circuit breaker in? Could be - Yes, this one right here.

[03:07:54:50]
LMP: Good line. It's on. Because that line is open.

[03:07:55:21]
LMP: I'll look over at that caution in a minute.

[03:07:55:53]
LMP: Vance, Aquarius.

[03:07:55:56]
CC:  Roger. Go ahead, Fred.

[03:07:56:01]
LMP: Yes. We've managed the first 30 hours or so here
     without the caution and warning; we don't need to
     keep it up now, do we?

[03:07:56:27]
CC:  Okay, Fred. That's one that we're leaving up until
     the [glossary:PTC] is established. We have a procedure for
     [glossary:PTC] to try with you, which we're hopeful will work
     pretty well. And I'll read that up as soon as you
     get what you're doing now done.

[03:07:56:43]
LMP: Okay.

[03:07:56:44]
CDR: Why don't you go ahead, and I'll get this [glossary:PTC]
     procedure. It's by the photo log, and I'll just
     get that.

[03:07:57:05]
LMP: And one other question, Houston. You really want
     to pull the ASA breaker? You want to give up the [glossary:AGS] probably 
     for good now, huh?

[03:07:57:33]
CDR: Houston, I'm standing by to copy the [glossary:PTC] procedures.

[03:07:57:39]
CC:  Okay. I'll get back with you on your question
     in a minute, Fred. New, here comes the [glossary:PTC]
     procedure. Step 1, GUIDANCE CONTROL to [glossary:PGNS];
     two MODE CONTROL, ATT HOLD; [glossary:VERB 76], ENTER;
     maneuver to [glossary:PTC] attitude; and that incidentally
     is roll 0, pitch 90, and present yaw. We realize
     you can't monitor that on your [glossary:FDAI], but you can
     on a verb, with a [glossary:VERB 16] [glossary:NOUN 20].

[03:07:58:20]
_page : 348
_tape : Tape 53/8
CC:  With me?

[03:07:58:40]
CDR: Roger. GUIDANCE CONTROL, [glossary:PGNS]; MODE CONTROL, ATT
     HOLD, [glossary:VERB 76], ENTER; maneuver to [glossary:PTC] attitude
     which is roll 0, pitch 90, and yaw, which is the
     present yaw. Is that correct?

[03:07:58:54]
CC:  That's correct. Okay. Next. Mode - at - When
     you're established at the attitude, MODE CONTROL
     AUTO. Key in [glossary:VERB 16] [glossary:NOUN 20] to monitor rates;
     when less than 0.1 degree a second, rate in all -
     in each axis, then disable plus-X thrusters.
     Okay. Next [glossary:VERB 25], [glossary:NOUN 07], ENTER; 1257, ENTER;
     252, ENTER; 1, ENTER; [glossary:VERB 77], ENTER; [glossary:VERB 48],
     ENTER; put in the DAR 22110 and PROCEED; [glossary:VERB 34],
     ENTER; then [glossary:VERB 16], [glossary:NOUN 20]; and monitor rates.
     On rates less than 0.01 degrees per second in all
     axis: [glossary:VERB 76], ENTER; MODE CONTROL, ATT HOLD;
     then 30 clicks of right yaw to start the maneuver.
     Over.

[03:08:01:48]
CDR: Okay, Vance. [glossary:PTC] procedure: GUIDANCE CONTROL,
     [glossary:PGNS]; MODE CONTROL, ATT HOLD; [glossary:VERB 76], ENTER;
     maneuver to [glossary:PTC] attitude; roll 0, pitch 90,
     yaw 0; my ball now, of course, is inoperative,
     so I'll have to get that on the [glossary:DSKY]. The 5 is
     MODE CONTROL, AUTO; 6: [glossary:VERB 16], [glossary:NOUN 20], monitor
     rates; rates less that 1 degree per second in
     each axis, disable, and I didn't hear that last
     part. The next one was [glossary:VERB 25], [glossary:NOUN 07], ENTER;
     1257, ENTER; 252, ENTER; 1, ENTER; [glossary:VERB 77], ENTER;
     [glossary:VERB 48], ENTER; 22110, PROCEED; [glossary:VERB 34], ENTER;
     [glossary:VERB 16], [glossary:NOUN 20], ENTER; monitor rates. Rates less
     than 0.01 degrees per second in all axis. [glossary:VERB 76],
     ENTER; MODE CONTROL, ATT HOLD; then 30 clicks of
     right yaw to stop - to start - maneuvers

[03:08:03:04]
CC:  Roger. That's correct, Jim. To - to answer your
     questions and correct one point, yaw should be 
     your present yaw, whatever it is, and that's up
     with roll 0, pitch 90, present yaw. The other
     thing is, you said disable and you didn't hear
     the rest. That's disable plus-X thrusters. And,
     finally, near the end, the 22110 referred to
     [glossary:DAP] loading.

[03:08:03:48]
_page : 349
_tape : Tape 53/9
CDR: Roger. Now, to maneuver to [glossary:PTC] roll 0, pitch 90
     and yaw in - and pitch in here, roll is here.
     Yaw - whatever yaw we have in. Okay, Vance.
     In our initial maneuver to [glossary:PTC] attitude, I am going
     to have to use - to display 16 20 and I'll have
     to use the [glossary:TTCA] to get there.

[03:08:05:01]
CC:  Jim, Roger. Your use of the TC - [glossary:TTCA] and just a
     reminder that in maneuvering that - that - that
     roll is in R<sub>3</sub> and yaw is in R<sub>1</sub>.

[03:08:05:17]
CDR: That's affirm. And I'm going to take out roll
     first to get it zero and then I'm going to take
     care of pitch.

[03:08:05:24]
CC:  Okay.

[03:08:06:07]
CDR: Okay. GUIDANCE CONTROL, [glossary:PGNS]; MODE CONTROL to
     ATT HOLD. [glossary:VERB 73] clears. Okay. We've got to
     get that out. ...  it stopped moving.

[03:08:06:54]
CDR: Here we go.

[03:08:07:32]
CDR: ... the battery. ...

[03:08:08:27]
CDR: Do you know what the plus-X thrusters are?

[03:08:08:41]
CDR: Yes, okay. I just wanted to make sure you do. I
     got them over here.

[03:08:08:55]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[03:08:08:59]
CDR: Go ahead.

[03:08:09:01]
CC:  Okay. A couple of things, Jim. One is that you
     can use the [glossary:TTCA|TTCAs] to maneuver, but you're going
     to save a lot of fuel if you'd try MINIMUM IMPULSE.
     So, that might be a better recommendation. The other
     thing is, we'd like to give you a GO before you disable 
     the plus-X thrusters, and before you do a
     [glossary:VERB 76], and MODE CONTROL to ATT HOLD. Over.

[03:08:09:40]
CDR: Okay; understand. You want a GO before I - I'm -
     Of course, I just did a 76, and the MODE CONTROL
     is in ATT HOLD, at this time. But, this is later on down.

[03:08:10:04]
CC:  Yes. All we wanted to do was take a look at things
     before you disabled the plus-X thrusters, and before 
     you go to MIN IMPULSE at the end there - that
     [glossary:VERB 76], ENTER; MODE CONTROL, ATT HOLD.

[03:08:10:20]
_page : 350
_tape : Tape 53/10
CDR: Roger. Understand. And I'm maneuvering my roll now to zero.

[03:08:10:25]
CC:  Roger.

[03:08:10:51]
CDR: Yes. Those are the plus-X, right?

[03:08:11:03]
LMP: Houston, Aquarius

[03:08:11:07]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[03:08:11:11]
LMP: Ah -

[03:08:11:12]
CC:  Go ahead.

[03:08:11:13]
LMP: In what fashion did you want us to disable those
     plus-X thrusters? Just pulling those appropriate
     TCA breakers, or did you want to actually go in
     and mask those jets?

[03:08:11:33]
CC:  Okay, Fred. We didn't explain that. The [glossary:VERB 25],
     [glossary:NOUN 07], ENTER sequence does that.

[03:08:11:43]
LMP: Okay. I didn't read the whole procedure. Jim
     just mentioned he wanted to disable plus-X.

[03:08:11:49]
CDR: I just did.

[03:08:11:50]
LMP: Okay.

[03:08:12:32]
LMP: And, Vance, are you still trying to get me an
     answer on that - pulling that ASA breaker?

[03:08:12:44]
CC:  That's affirm, Fred. This - The word here is,
     pull it.

[03:08:12:53]
LMP: Okay. Sure didn't get much work out of the [glossary:AGS] this time.

[03:08:14:43]
LMP: It's going slightly.

[03:08:14:45]
CDR: So is this one.

[03:08:15:26]
LMP: Yes. You got a ways to go in pitch.

[03:08:15:29]

CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[03:08:20:23]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[03:08:20:25]
CC:  Okay. Just some info. We're working up a procedure 
     for you to use to - to use command module
     LiOH canisters to connect to your hoses - the
     outlet hoses in the [glossary:LM] so that, as time passes
     in the mission, you can continue scrubbing the
     [glossary:LM] atmosphere. And this whole thing requires
     modifying a kit so that you can attach the hose
     modifying a LiOH canister, so you can attach the
     hose to it. So, sometime in the future, we will
     be coming up to you with that procedure. Second
     point - Second point in, we're standing by to
     watch your maneuver for the [glossary:PTC] procedure. Over.

[03:08:21:16]
CDR: Okay. I'm in process now, Vance, of maneuvering
     to zero yaw, 90-degree pitch, using MINIMUM IMPULSE.

[03:08:21:25]
CC:  Okay.

[03:08:21:42]
LMP: And, Vance, I assume it had also been brought up
     that we got two extra secondary cartridges - one
     in each [glossary:PLSS].

[03:08:21:55]
CC:  Roger.

[03:08:22:07]
CDR: We ought to start working on that MOD right now.

[03:08:22:13]
CC:  Yes. We wish we could send you a kit and it
     would be kind of like putting a model airplane
     together or something. As it turns out, this
     contraption will look like a mailbox when you
     get it all put together.

[03:08:22:50]
CDR: Just for information, Houston, during - just
     prior to going around the Moon, we saw a lot of
     debris that was floating by us, including some -
     one rather large piece looked like the wrapping
     off of a line of some sort that is - still is with us.

[03:08:23:10]

[03:08:23:24]
CC:  Okay. We copy that.

[03:08:23:40]
CDR: No matter what I do, I can't stop that. Roll
     either way won't do it.

[03:08:23:49]
LMP: Jim?

[03:08:24:06]
LMP: Well, I don't see any way around it, Jim. It
     sure doesn't seem to be doing much, does it?
     It won't go down.

[03:08:24:29]
CDR: I don't know. I wonder if they tried that in the
     simulator. I can't seem to get roll to go up.
     It goes down on me, no matter how I hit the
     controllers.

[03:08:24:45]

[03:08:27:59]
CDR: Go ahead.

[03:08:28:01]
CC:  Jim, we don't have any data on your movements
     right now. How does it look like this procedure's
     going to work out so far as getting an attitude
     set up, the first part of the procedure?

[03:08:28:19]
CDR: Well, Vance, I've been trying to use MINIMUM
     IMPULSE only attitude control to get my roll
     and yaw - the roll and pitch, rather. But, with
     the attitude control only in this configuration,
     I - I can't command these - the roll the way I
     want to. So, I had to go to [glossary:TTCA] to get my roll
     to build up towards zero, it was going - decreasing
     towards 270. I really don't know what the combination 
     is in the attitude control, that you can get
     the control to pitch and roll the way you want it
     to. You've got to use the [glossary:TTCA].

[03:08:29:00]
CC:  Roger. Copy.

[03:08:29:04]
CDR: I now have both pitch and yaw - or pitch and roll
     going toward the designated amounts, now passing
     through 23 degrees in pitch, and I'm going up
     past 321 degrees in roll. And I am letting go
     that direction and when I get there, 90 in pitch
     and zero in roll, I'll go to AUTO and damp the
     rates.

[03:08:30:00]
CDR: Get a little sleep? That's okay.

[03:08:30:28]

CC:  Okay, Jim. We're going to have to get back with
     you in a couple of minutes on whether or not we
     switch over at this time to your other canister.
     Second point, it might help in setting up this
     [glossary:PTC] if you concentrate on roll first, and get
     that going; and then work on pitch, when roll is
     established, and sort of take whatever yaw you get.

[03:08:34:21]
CDR: Okay. Vance, I tried that but when I start doing
     roll only I get pitch coupled in with it. But
     both of them rolling up toward this desired
     amount, though. I'm up to 46 and in pitch and
     326 in roll.

[03:08:36:45]
CDR: Go ahead, Vance.

[03:08:36:46]
CC:  Okay, Jim. Since the first recommendation on
     how to maneuver [glossary:PTC] didn't work out, we have
     another one. And you might try this. Put yaw
     at zero, then start the roll, and the pitch
     after that.

[03:08:37:27]
LMP: Vance, do you read?

[03:08:37:29]
CC:  Yes. I do now. Go ahead.

[03:08:37:33]
LMP: Okay. You guys just tell me what sort of material
     you had in mind to build this mailbox out of, and
     Jack and I will go to work on trying to construct
     that thing. Assume we'll use the space-age baling
     wire or the gray tape?

[03:08:37:51]
CC:  That's affirm. We have a lengthy procedure here;
     but, in short, you use plastic as a covering for
     the whole thing. You put some kind of a stiffener
     at the top so the plastic doesn't suck against
     the [glossary:LOI] - LiOH enter - entrance side. You'll -
     You need gray tape to stick the whole thing together, 
     and you need something like a sock to
     put in the - the bottom so that the outlet side
     is plugged up. As it turns out, the flow is
     rather U-shaped through the cartridge, Fred. It,
     if you plug up the bottom, it comes in one side
     of the top and goes out the other.

[03:08:38:45]
LMP: Okay. (Sigh) Hold on a minute. Let - Let us go
     get a cartridge and with it in hand, I'll speak
     to you some more.

[03:08:39:06]
CC:  Okay. Really, I think we should give you a more
     detailed procedure on that; and, in general,
     those are the materials that are to be used, but
     let us get back with a detailed procedure on how
     to make this cartridge arrangement work.

[03:08:39:27]
LMP: Okay.

[03:08:39:38]
CDR: And to answer your question about [glossary:PTC], Vance,
     it's rather difficult to use yaw in zero right
     away. So what I'm doing, yaw is working toward
     zero right now. Pitch is working toward 90,
     and roll is working toward - zero. So, we -
     We're just going to take some time to get there, that's all.

[03:08:40:08]

     you're still having a problem getting there with

CDR: Yes, I've been trying to get roll out. Roll to
     zero. Just go ahead to zero, I'm going to put
     it in ATT HOLD. Then it'll take out yaw, leaving
     pitch the way it is; then we're going to pitch down.

[03:08:50:48]
LMP: We've got to think about when we have to start
     changing that canister.

[03:08:50:55]
LMP: Fifteen even.

[03:08:50:57]
CDR: Huh?

[03:08:50:58]
LMP: ... to 15.

[03:08:51:00]
CDR: What is it right now?

[03:08:51:02]
LMP: Nothing. We're not reading anything.

[03:08:51:07]
CDR: Well, that's the one they wanted you to leave in.

[03:08:51:10]

LMP: ...

[03:08:51:14]
CDR: It's in. That's how it triggers the - Okay,
     Jack. I'm going to push in on this thing to
     stop it.

[03:08:51:35]
CMP: Yes.

[03:08:51:51]
LMP: That just turned the MASTER ALARM back on. Now
     that it's on steady, I'll leave it on. I can't
     understand why I got a power - Oh, I know.
     That's right. ... That reading is correct.

[03:08:53:03]
CDR: Yaw. I'm going the wrong way though, aren't I?

[03:08:54:32]
LMP: (Laughter).

[03:08:54:54]
LMP: Okay. What we're going to do, Jack, ... over there ...

[03:08:55:19]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[03:08:55:25]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[03:08:55:26]
CC:  Jim, it looks pretty good except that the pitch
     is going out in the wrong direction, now. Over.

[03:08:55:37]
CDR: I concur. What I'm going to do is get roll to
     zero and I'm trying to bring yaw into zero and
     as soon as I get those two pretty well matched
     up, then I'm going to take the pitch and try to
     pitch it down.

[03:08:55:49]
CC:  Okeydoke.

[03:08:57:33]
CDR: Okay. Now I've got pitch going down; I've got
     roll almost zero and yaw is almost zero.

[03:08:57:42]
CC:  Okay. Copy, there, Jim.

[03:09:01:26]
CDR: Houston, what's an acceptable pitch attitude,
     that you'll take?

[03:09:01:56]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[03:09:02:12]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[03:09:02:17]
CDR: Roger. What's the acceptable pitch attitude
     that we can have for [glossary:PTC]? I can go into AUTO
     any time now, I'm looking at 118 degrees in
     pitch, practically zero roll, and about 40 degrees of yaw.

[03:09:02:31]
_page : 359
_tape : Tape 54/6
CC: Ninety degrees of pitch.

[03:09:02:37]
CDR: I'm looking at 118 degrees of pitch.

[03:09:02:48]
CC:  Stand by.

[03:09:03:06]
CDR: I'm trying to talk to them.

[03:09:03:09]
CC:  Stand by a minute, Jim. The pitch is the
     important thing, but - but stand by 1.

[03:09:03:19]
CDR: Okay. It's coming down. What's that? Well, I
     guess I'd better eat something. Hey, this one
     has some of that candied jelly ... you know,
     we've gone a hell of a long time without any
     sleep. I said we've gone a hell of a long time
     without any sleep.

[03:09:03:47]
CDR: We'll have to start thinking about getting the
     ... back to sleep again because - I know - I -
     I didn't get hardly any sleep last night at all.

[03:09:07:16]
CMP: Hey, Fred? These jettison bags with the - are
     real airtight stuff, if you want to use them for
     wrapping for a lithium hydroxide bag or something
     like that.

[03:09:07:33]
LMP: Yes, this stuff is really tight.

[03:09:07:46]
CDR: Yes.

[03:09:10:12]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[03:09:10:16]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[03:09:10:17]
CC:  Okay, Jim. Would you stable your - stabilize
     your rates here at the attitudes you're at now
     and go ATT HOLD. Over.

[03:09:10:29]
CDR: Okay. Will do. I'm now at 103 degrees -
     106 degrees pitch, and 2.5 degrees roll.

[03:09:10:36]
CC:  Roger.

[03:09:11:04]
LMP: ...?

[03:09:11:06]
CDR: No.

[03:09:12:16]
CDR: ... mine are ... Hey, I got you a clean one.

[03:09:12:22]
LMP: Okay.

[03:09:12:23]
_page : 360
_tape : Tape 54/7
CDR: Last one's in the trash bag. Oh, I thought -
     if you wanted a ..., you'll have to use the
     lithium hydroxide ...

[03:09:13:18]
CDR: Okay, Houston. Are you monitoring my angles?
     It appears that it might be less then 1 degree
     per second.

[03:09:13:30]
CC:  Stand by. We'll check them, Jim.

[03:09:14:29]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[03:09:14:34]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[03:09:14:36]
CC:  Jim, that's affirm. We're monitoring and you're
     almost there, but we'd like to let them stabilize
     a little bit longer. Over.

[03:09:14:48]
CDR: Okay. We'll - We'll just hold.

[03:09:14:51]
CC:  And if - if you can now go into your eat period
     or do something else while the rates are stabilizing, why, 
     we recommend you relax somewhere and get some chow.

[03:09:15:07]
CDR: Right-o. We'll do that.

[03:09:18:03]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[03:09:18:08]
CDR: Go ahead.

[03:09:18:10]
CC:  Okay, Jim. Looks like your rates are damped
     sufficient. Recommend that you go ahead with
     the [glossary:VERB 25], [glossary:NOUN 07], ENTER bit on down through
     the [glossary:VERB 34], ENTER, and then wish you'd stand
     by for us to look at it again before you go
     beyond that. Over.

[03:09:18:36]
CDR: Okay, Houston. I'll go through [glossary:VERB 25], [glossary:NOUN 07],
     down through [glossary:VERB 34] ENTER, and I'll stand by.

[03:09:18:47]
CC:  Right-o.

[03:09:19:46]
CDR: Okay, Houston. That's complete.

[03:09:19:55]
CC:  Roger. Houston copies, and we'll - -

[03:09:19:58]
CDR: You ... monitor our rates?

[03:09:19:59]
CC:  Roger.

[03:09:20:08]
_page : 361
_tape : Tape 54/8
CC:  We - -

[03:09:20:09]
CDR: You want to monitor the rates; we're 16 20.

[03:09:20:12]
CC:  Roger. That's the way it should be done, and
     we're standing by for the rates to dump out
     some more.

[03:09:20:21]
CDR: Okay.

[03:09:20:51]
CMP: How you coming?

[03:09:20:56]
CDR: Oh, we're taking stock of how much we got there,
     maybe sort of think about rationing some of it.
     I mean just to make sure we've got enough to
     last us and that we get enough water out. I'd
     hate to run out of water on the last day. Take
     a look and see how much we got, and fill them
     up and just hold them there. Yes, and I'll tell
     you the stuff that's good to eat now will be the
     candies, the sandwich spreads. Maybe the freeze -
     the dehydrated stuff. If you have to rehydrate
     it, it'd be kind of difficult. No, wet packs are
     good.

[03:09:22:24]
CDR: As a matter of fact, we might use those little -
     Well, how about the [glossary:PLSS]s?

[03:09:22:34]
CDR: Yes, I know, but I mean the [glossary:PLSS]s are bombs, too.

[03:09:22:39]
CMP: ...

[03:09:22:41]
CDR: We're damping rates.

[03:09:22:44]
CMP: ...

[03:09:22:47]
CDR: Well, maybe we ought to use the [glossary:OPS] first.

[03:09:25:57]
CDR: You guys moving around?

[03:09:26:07]
CDR: Okay.

[03:09:27:25]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston. Over.

[03:09:27:30]
CDR: Go ahead, Vance.

[03:09:27:32]
CC:  Jim, just a reminder. Any waste water dumped at
     this point would really jiggle up the [glossary:PTC] preparation, so request 
     you save that until we're spun up. Over.

[03:09:27:49]
_page : 362
_tape : Tape 54/9
CDR: Right. I don't think we're doing any.

[03:09:27:52]
CC: No. No, I don't think so, but I just wanted 
     to make sure you were aware of it - I thought you were.

[03:09:28:03]
CDR: We're saving all the water we can.

[03:09:30:12]
CMP: ... for a minute?

[03:09:30:16]
CDR: With the new space. ... we're ... We've just
     about slowed down. You're damping right.

[03:09:31:53]
LMP: There she is.

[03:09:32:34]
LMP: And, Houston, Aquarius.

[03:09:32:39]
CC:  Houston. Go ahead.

[03:09:32:48]
CMP: Okay, Vance. A couple of items we uncovered for
     that cartridge MOD. One is the special dust
     covering bag that we were going to use on the
     tote bags, that is pretty thick and nonporous;
     and we went up to the upstairs kitchen and
     drained water a couple of more times, and made
     up a whole bunch of drink bags, again; and from
     the pantry, we retrieved a fairly large - enclosed
     - enclosure made of plastic that those drink
     bags are in that I think we can scissor and also
     make do for a cover, taping it on, if that's
     appropriate.

[03:09:33:34]
CC:  Okay. Jack Lousma here has a refined version of
     the procedure on how to make these the easy way,
     and I think before too long he ought to be reading that up to you. If - -

[03:09:33:52]
CMP: Okay.

[03:09:33:53]
CC:  It's not time critical to get this up to you.
     It's just that, before you get too far in assembling these on your 
     own, we'd kind of like to
     give you the benefit of experience down here.

[03:09:34:10]
CMP: Okay. Who - Who built them back there.

[03:09:34:17]
CC:  Tony did some of it, and Jack's been working on
     it, too. So we've had a big effort on it.

[03:09:34:27]
CMP: Great.

[03:09:34:37]
_page : 363
_tape : Tape 54/10
CC: We would encourage you to wait until tomorrow
     to receive that procedure, but we can send it up
     sooner, if you insist. Over.

[03:09:34:47]
CMP: No, that's all right, Vance. Before we have to
     worry about that I guess we got another primary
     and three secondaries to go through.

[03:09:34:58]
CC:  That's right.

[03:09:35:18]
CMP: You know, sometimes those cartridges have - I
     guess they rejuvenate.

[03:09:35:29]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[03:09:35:32]
LMP: Man, that's a wicked low pressure down there. I
     wish I was on it. (Laughter).

[03:09:35:44]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[03:09:35:47]
LMP: ... up ...

[03:09:35:50]
CC:  Okay, Jim. Your rates are once again looking
     good so we can continue on with the rest of this
     procedure. Request you go ahead with the [glossary:VERB 76]
     ENTER, and MODE CONTROL, to ATT HOLD, and then the
     last step, 30 clicks yaw right.

[03:09:36:13]
LMP: Jets are firing again.

[03:09:36:18]
CDR: Okay. I'll do a [glossary:VERB 76] ENTER with the MODE
     CONTROL ATT HOLD and then 30 clicks of right yaw
     to set the maneuver.

[03:09:36:26]
CC:  [glossary:VERB 76] ENTER.

[03:09:36:31]
CDR: Roger.

[03:09:36:36]
CDR: There's your [glossary:VERB 76], ENTER. MODE CONTROL to
     ATT HOLD. Now you want me to do 30 clicks of right yaw?

[03:09:36:58]
CDR: Vance, did you say for me to hold on the right
     yaw or do you want me to start it now?

[03:09:37:04]
CC: No, no need to hesitate, you can start now.

[03:09:37:10]
CDR: Okay.

[03:09:37:20]
_page : 364
_tape : Tape 54/11
CC:  After you get that going, then we'll think about
     powering down the [glossary:PGNS].

[03:09:37:39]
CDR: Okay. There were 30 clicks of right yaw.

[03:09:37:43]
CC:  Okay. We'd like to look at it for just a little
     while before we power down the [glossary:PGNS], so stand by.

[03:09:38:00]
CDR: Understand you're planning to power down the FGNS?

[03:09:38:06]
CC:  Right. We want to get the amps down.

[03:09:38:09]
CDR: Okay.

[03:09:38:10]
LMP: ... finish ...

[03:09:38:19]
LMP: That's bad news.

[03:09:38:20]
CMP: Take 26 pictures of you?

[03:09:38:23]
LMP: Why not?

[03:09:38:29]
LMP: You want to bring all the film back empty?

[03:09:38:38]
CMP: I'd like to just ... and shoot it.

[03:09:39:10]
CDR: Well, that means I've got to -

[03:09:39:14]
CMP: Hey, let me see if I can get this started here.

[03:09:39:18]
LMP: Okay.

[03:09:39:37]
LMP: Hey, Jim.

[03:09:39:40]
CDR: Yes, we'll probably get there ..

[03:09:41:39]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Request AFT OMNI.

[03:09:41:54]
LMP: You got it, Vance?

[03:09:41:56]
CC:  Roger. That did it. Thank you.

[03:09:42:27]
CMP: Gad, there's Ptolemaeus and Alphonsus.

[03:09:42:30]
LMP: Yes, sure enough.

[03:09:42:32]
CMP: See them right over the edge.

[03:09:43:11]

[03:09:43:19]
LMP: Yes.

[03:09:43:21]
CDR: Looks like we got ... to do with Earth? Ptolemaeus?

[03:09:43:24]
LMP: We need it to aline again.

[03:09:43:42]
CMP: You don't think that burn was enough, do you?

[03:09:43:43]
LMP: Was that a midcourse? The [glossary:RCS] is worse.

[03:09:43:50]
CDR: The [glossary:RCS] ... attitude.

[03:09:44:29]
LMP: ... ought to come up the side. Then, you got us
     in the right plane, Jim. We're in the right
     plane. We're pointed off and we'll swerve on
     again with the Earth, Moon, and Sun.

[03:09:44:52]
CDR: In another respect, it might be easier to get a -

[03:09:45:05]
LMP: Look in the rear detent now. Go to -

[03:09:45:15]
CMP: How's that?

[03:09:45:17]
LMP: Awful.

[03:09:45:19]
LMP: Oh, that's right. That blasted service - command
     module is back there. Scratch that one. That one?

[03:09:45:33]
CDR: It's not much better. Okay, let's go this one.

[03:09:45:38]
LMP: Keep the ...

[03:09:45:41]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[03:09:45:46]
CDR: Go ahead.

[03:09:45:47]
CC:  Jim, we have some status information for you, if
     you're ready to copy on a piece of scratch paper.

[03:09:45:58]
LMP: Stand by, Vance.

[03:09:45:59]
CC:  Okay.

[03:09:46:04]
_page : 366
CDR: We're ready for you.

[03:09:46:06]
LMP: Put that away and get some status paper here.

[03:09:46:11]
CDR: Go ahead, Vance.

[03:09:46:13]
CC:  Okay. First, midcourse correction will probably
     be at [glossary:GET] 104 hours, and all we look for is a
     4- to 6-feet-per-second DELTA-V. Okay. That's
     the first item. Now, I will give you a rundown
     on consumables. Okay. In the [glossary:LM], you have 1498 -
     that is 1 4 9 8 amp-hours remaining. That means
     over 61 hours you'd - That would average out to
     24.5 amps. We expect that, after powerdown, that
     you will use 1 4 or 14 amps per hour, and that
     would leave a reserve of 500 amp-hours at the
     end of the mission. Are you with me?

[03:09:47:29]
CDR: Roger. We're with you.

[03:09:47:30]
LMP: I saved my - number was yesterday.

[03:09:47:33]
CC: Okay. In the [glossary:LM], you have - -

[03:09:47:36]
CDR: We're with you.

[03:09:47:37]
CC:  Roger. In the [glossary:LM], you have 215, that is 2 1 5,
     pounds of water, usable. That would average out
     over 61 hours to 3.5 pounds per hour available.
     Okay.

[03:09:48:15]
CC:  Okay. And after you power down, we expect that
     you will be using water at the rate of 3.2 to
     2.7 pounds - That's at 14 amps per hour electrical
     usage rate. One note, this does not - When we
     speak here of water available, this does not include 
     [glossary:CSM] water and [glossary:PLSS] water, so that's add
     on. Okay, next, LiOH. Using the [glossary:CSM] cans, you
     will have 16 cans at 12 hours per can to give
     you 1 9 2, or 192 hours, of LiOH. And, in the
     [glossary:LM], using its cans, you have 44 hours remaining.

[03:09:49:29]
CDR: Vance, is that with the [glossary:PLSS] secondaries?

[03:09:49:34]
CC:  That's affirm. That's affirm. That includes
     [glossary:PLSS] secondaries.

[03:09:49:47]
CC:  Okay; oxygen. You have remaining 44 pounds in
     the [glossary:LM]. At a usage rate of 0.36 pounds per hour,
     that leaves you 120, or 1 2 0, hours of oxygen.
     Okay. Next, [glossary:RCS]. [glossary:RCS] A stands at 6 2 percent
     and B at 6 2 percent. We only expect 2 percent
     to be used for the [glossary:PTC], so you're in good shape
     for [glossary:RCS]. Next, [glossary:DPS] DELTA-V. You have 1190 feet
     per second remaining. And, finally, [glossary:CSM] [glossary:EPS].
     We estimate that you have 99 amp-hours. That's
     an estimate. And that's it. Over.

[03:09:51:19]
_page : 367
_tape : Tape 54/14
CDR: Okay. I copy.

[03:09:51:24]
CC:  Okay. And just a question. It would be interesting 
     to hear from Jack to see if he thinks that
     main B bus is good. If he has any idea of how,
     if whether it's good or not, this would influence 
     our steps in the future; for example, we
     might want to try to test main B to see if it is,
     in fact, good so that we'd know how to set switches
     for entry.

[03:09:52:00]
CDR: Roger. Just a minute. They want to know whether
     you think main bus B is any good for the command
     module.

[03:09:52:14]
CDR: Vance, while Jack's got on the loop, let me pose
     the question of how we're planning on doing this
     midcourse, if we are going to power down the [glossary:PGNS].

[03:09:52:27]
CC:  Would you stand by on that, Jim? We'd like to
     give you a procedure for that later on.

[03:09:52:34]
CDR: Okay. Got a midcourse at 104 hours, he's going
     to give us a procedure for that later on.

[03:09:52:48]
CC:  In short, Jim, we don't expect any problem, but
     we'll explain further later on.

[03:09:53:00]
CDR: Okay.

[03:09:53:02]
CC:  Deke says get a night's sleep. He says you've
     been working hard, and you ought to relax a
     little bit and be ready for tomorrow.

[03:09:53:17]
CMP: Vance, this is Jack.

[03:09:53:19]
CC:  Go ahead, Jack.

[03:09:53:23]
CMP: Okay. Let me give you my observations on main
     bus B. Things happened pretty fast there, and
     we first heard the impact or explosion or whatever caused 
     it, I'm not sure. The next - About
     1 second later, there was a MASTER ALARM which
     was the MAIN BUS B UNDERVOLT. I looked at the
     voltage, and the voltage was good at this time
     so I'm suspecting it was a spike. Fuel cell 3
     was also good, with good flow. However, Fred,
     at that point, was coming into the command
     module and got over into his seat. At that
     time, we shortly had an AC BUS 2 light about the
     time he got into his seat. He looked at the
     MAIN BUS B and the MAIN BUS B was reading ZERO.
     It, however, - and the fuel cell flows were
     ZERO. I'm kind of suspecting that perhaps we do
     have a MAIN - a current MAIN BUS B. But that's
     merely a guess. I never did try to reset it.
     We were having other problems with the MAIN BUS A,
     having an UNDERVOLT and a few other things like
     that. I'd kind of like to hear what your feelings
     are down there.

CC:  Well, Jack, we copy your information. And we'd
     like to hold off because we're still working the
     problem. So we'll have to give you information
     later.

[03:09:55:14]
CC:  Thank you.

[03:09:55:23]
CC:  Aquarius, request AFT OMNI.

[03:09:55:37]
CMP: Vance, are you back with me?

[03:09:55:40]
CC:  Roger. We're with you.

[03:09:55:44]
CMP: Okay. We lost lock there. We switched OMNIs.
     Just for my own - kind of to get my thoughts in
     order, I'd kind of hear what - I'd like to hear
     what kind of entry you're planning. [glossary:EMS] or [glossary:PGNS]
     or what ?

[03:09:56:02]
CC:  Okay. [glossary:PGNS] entry is being planned, and people
     are at work on checklist changes and that sort
     of thing.

[03:09:56:14]
CMP: Okay. Real fine.

[03:09:56:17]
CC:  And - we'll - We'll give you the [glossary:CSM] stuff tomorrow, 
     but basically we expect that main bus B
     is good and we're going to work up a procedure
     to test it.

[03:09:56:32]
CMP: Okay. Those are my thoughts, too.

[03:09:56:34]
CC:  But - -

[03:09:56:36]
CMP: You think main bus B is good, don't you?

[03:09:56:39]
_page : 369
_tape : Tape 54/16
CC: That's affirm.. We think it is, but we want to
     check it out anyway. We think you guys are in
     great shape all the way around. Why don't you
     quit worrying, and go to sleep.

[03:09:56:51]
CMP: Oh, that - That's our boss, Deke.

[03:09:56:58]
CDR: Well, I think we just might do that - or part of
     us will.

[03:09:57:25]
CMP: I mixed up. How many more of those - Are we hot
     mike? - -

[03:09:57:28]
CDR: Yes.

[03:09:57:36]
CMP: Yes, I'm mixed up. You had 15? I mixed up seven
     more. So we got 22. By the way, there's still
     some water that's- it's not enough pressure to
     mix up another drink, but there is some water
     out of there, if you want to get some water out
     of the drink cup.

[03:09:57:59]
LMP: That's good; I could use some.

[03:09:58:00]
CMP: We ought to use that oxygen up and not waste it.
     (Cough)

[03:09:58:17]
CDR: You monitoring right now?

[03:09:58:23]
CMP: Yes. Just stand by.

[03:09:58:25]
CDR: What'll it take to ...

[03:09:58:29]
CMP: Yes.

[03:09:58:30]
LMP: You only got two ... there, so ...

[03:09:58:34]
LMP: I will.

[03:09:58:49]
CMP: You wouldn't believe it, but I'm now in command
     of the [glossary:LM]. Okay. Vance, I'm probably the only
     CMP that's ever witnessed a [glossary:DPS] burn sitting on
     the ascent engine head.

[03:09:59:33]
LMP: Did you get some? Is there any coming out still?
     They didn't answer. I think we made it. How's
     this working out?

[03:09:59:52]
_extra : Pace 363
CDR: Okay. No problem.

[03:09:59:55]
_page : 370
_tape : Tape 54/17
CMP: They are, huh? How are we going to get an
     alinement?

[03:10:00:03]
CDR: We'll pull one out someways, I guess. We've
     gotta watch that one right there.

[03:10:00:18]
LMP: It's decreasing now. It'll - it'll - It's
     cold. I noticed that in the command module. It'll wobble.

[03:10:00:51]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[03:10:00:59]
LMP: Switch OMNIs to TRANSMIT.

[03:10:01:02]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[03:10:01:04]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[03:10:01:08]
CDR: Roger. Are you planned to set up here very
     shortly - a powerdown procedure?

[03:10:01:15]
CC:  That's affirmative, if you'll take out your
     contingency book and turn to page Power 6. Over.

[03:10:01:23]
CDR: Roger. Stand by. Contingency Power 6. Get the
     book over here. Contingency Power 6.

[03:10:01:33]
LMP: Well, I hope this ...

[03:10:01:37]
CC:  And while you're doing that, let's put ATTITUDE
     CONTROL, three, switches to MODE CONTROL.

[03:10:01:50]
CDR: All three ATTITUDE CONTROL switches have been
     in MODE CONTROL.

[03:10:01:53]
CC:  Okay. And when you get to Power 6, you ought
     to see a circuit breaker page, panel 11.

[03:10:02:03]
CDR: Have a pencil? Let's see it - thank you.

[03:10:02:12]
CDR: Okay. I have Power 6, panel 11.

[03:10:02:17]
CC:  Okay. On Power 6, panel 11 - The top three rows,
     configure them as you see them.

[03:10:02:31]
CDR: Okay, now, Jack ... We have put the TCAs in for
     the previous procedure. Do you want those out, now?

[03:10:02:48]
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim, Pull them out. TCAs
     open.

[03:10:02:54]
_page : 371
_tape : Tape 54/13
CDR: Okay. I'm changing those to ... back again.
     First three rows. And you're pulling the ATCA
     [glossary:PGNS], huh?

[03:10:03:04]
CC:  That's affirmative. Pull ATCA [glossary:PGNS] open.

[03:10:03:11]
CDR: Okay. I've done that.

[03:10:03:20]
CC:  Okay. Are you ready for the fourth row?

[03:10:03:25]
CDR: Affirm.

[03:10:03:27]
CC:  Okay. Now when we get in the fourth row, we're
     going to open the [glossary:IMU] OPERATE circuit breaker;
     and what that means is that we're going to lose
     the capability to watch your CDUs, so we're not
     going to be able to see your attitude. Therefore, 
     we will not be able to advise you on which
     antenna to select for communications. The way
     we want you to handle that is to turn the [glossary:LM]
     UPLINK SQUELCH off, and when you hear the noise,
     switch antennas. We'll be able to see you switch
     antennas, and it's going to take us about 3 to
     5 minutes to establish a lockon again after you
     switch. After each time that you switch antennas,
     we will initiate a voice check. And basically
     when you see the Earth out the window, you can
     be on FORWARD antenna, and when the Moon's up in
     the window use the AFT antenna. You copy?

[03:10:04:41]
CDR: Okay. We're going to pull the [glossary:IMU] OPERATE 
     circuit breaker, so you won't be able to see our
     attitude. Therefore, you won't tell us how to
     switch antennas and we'll enable the - I will
     turn the - up the SQUELCH OFF so that when we
     start getting any static, we'll switch antennas
     and as a thumb rule we could use - with the Earth
     forward, we use the FORWARD antenna and when we
     see the Moon we use the AFT antenna.

[03:10:05:12]
_extra : END OF TAPE
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim. In other words, we're
     leaving the antenna switching up to you, and
     after you switch antennas it's going to take
     3 to 5 minutes for us to establish a lockon
     again, and we'll initiate a voice check. And
     I'm ready to go on panel 11, row 4.

[03:10:05:34]
_page : 372
_tape : Tape 55/1
CDR: Okay.

[03:10:05:36]
CC:  Okay. On row 14, under HEATERS [glossary:RCS] SYSTEM A/B-1:
     open QUAD 1 through 4; under [glossary:ECS], the only change
     is - under GLYCOL PUMP close AUTO TRANSFER; under
     COMM, the only change is: open VHF A RECEIVER,
     open COMMANDER AUDIO; under [glossary:PGNS], the only change
     is: close and leave closed [glossary:IMU] STANDBY circuit
     breaker, so we can have heaters. Read back.

[03:10:06:30]
CDR: Okay. On row 4, we're going to open all four of
     the heaters - the [glossary:RCS] SYSTEM A and B - the first
     four circuit breakers. We're going to close the
     AUTO TRANSFER. We're going to open the VHF A
     RECEIVER and the COMMANDER AUDIO. And we're
     going to close the [glossary:IMU] STANDBY. The [glossary:LGC] [glossary:DSKY]
     and the [glossary:IMU] OPERATE will be open.

[03:10:07:05]
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim. All other breakers in
     that row are as you see them in the checklist.
     And on row 5, the only change is that we want
     you to, under [glossary:EPS], open ASCENT ECA CONTROL. Over.

[03:10:07:25]
CDR: Roger. I think we already have that opened -
     ASCENT ECA CONTROL is probably already open.

[03:10:07:36]
CDR: Okay. So let me confirm. We'll have one COMM
     system, that will be the LMP system, and we'll
     have to do our own antenna switching; therefore,
     we'll have to wait about - Okay, why don't you
     switch? Aft antenna.

[03:10:08:04]
CDR: We'll have to wait for you to get a lockon again.
     Is that correct?

[03:10:08:14]
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim. You'll be working off
     of the LMP's panel over there.

[03:10:08:22]
CDR: Okay. What else do you have for me?

[03:10:08:24]
CC:  Okay. Panel 16, that's on page Power-7. Top
     row, the only change is: under [glossary:RCS] SYSTEM B, open PQGS/DISPLAYS. Over.

[03:10:08:50]
CDR: Okay. I may go over this with you, Jack, 
     because this checklist has been written over two
     or three times now on our various procedures.
     Top row, the first two are open, the next three
     are closed, and we're going to open now the
     QUAD TCA's 1, 2, 3, 4; CROSSFEED will be closed,
     and the TEMP/PRESS DISPLAYFLAG will be opened,
     and we're going to open up the PQCS, MAIN SOV
     will be closed, and the ... will be opened.

[03:10:09:26]
_page : 373
_tape : Tape 55/2
CC: That's affirmative, Jim. And there's no change
     to the second row. Over.

[03:10:09:38]
CDR: Okay. Again let me go through this with you.
     The first four are going to be closed. The next
     sev - eight will be - the next nine will be open
     from LOGIC POWER B through DESCENT ENGINE OVERRIDE
     How about the [glossary:CWEA]? Is that going to be closed?

[03:10:10:08]
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim. We want the next five
     closed.

[03:10:10:15]
CDR: Okay.

[03:10:10:16]
CC:  Okay. In the third row, under COMM: DISPLAY,
     open; SE AUDIO, closed; VHF A TRANSMITTER,
     open - That's a change - VHF B RECEIVER, open;
     PRIMARY S-BAND, POWER AMPLIFIER, open;
     TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER, closed; S-BAND ANTENNA,
     open; PMP, closed; TV, open. Under [glossary:ECS]:
     DISPLAYS, open; GLYCOL PUMP SECONDARY, open;
     LOC PUMP, open; CABIN FAN CONTROL, open; CABIN
     REPRESS, closed; and all the next four closed
     also. Read back.

[03:10:11:12]
CDR: Okay. We have DISPLAY, open; SE AUDIO, closed;
     VHF A TRANSMITTER, open; VHF B RECEIVER, open;
     POWER AMP's going to be open; TRANSMITTER/
     RECEIVER, closed; S-BAND ANTENNA, open; PMP,
     closed; TV, open; DISPLAY is open; next three
     are open; CABIN REPRESS, closed; and all the
     rest closed.

[03:10:11:36]
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim. And in row 4, under
     HEATERS, we want them all - Correction - we
     want all the QUAD HEATERS open. Correction -
     we want all the QUAD HEATERS closed.

[03:10:11:53]
CDR: All the - -

[03:10:11:54]
CC:  We want DISPLAY, open; S-BAND ANTENNA, closed -
     to avoid a MASTER ALARM, CAMERA - SEQUENCE
     CAMERA, open; And under [glossary:EPS], we want DISPLAYs,
     open; DC BUS VOLT, closed; INVERTER 2, open;
     ASCENT ECA, closed; ASCENT ECA CONTROL, open;
     DESCENT ECA, closed; DESCENT ECA CONTROL, closed;
     TRANSLUNAR BUS TIE, close; we want the CROSS
     TIE BUS, open; the BAL LOADS, closed; BAT FEED
     TIEs, closed. How do you read?

[03:10:12:46]
_page : 374
_tape : Tape 55/3
CDR: Okay. The four [glossary:RCS] HEATERS will be closed;
     DISPLAYS, open; S-BAND ANTENNA, closed; CAMERA
     SEQUENCE will be open; DISPLAY will be open; DC
     BUS VOLT will be closed; INVERTER 2 open;
     ASCENT ECA will he closed, but the ASCENT ECA
     CONTROL, open; DESCENT ECA, closed; DESCENT ECA
     CONTROL, closed; TRANSLUNAR BUS TIE, closed;
     and CROSS TIE BUS, open; and BALANCE LOADS,
     closed; and the BAT FEED TIEs, closed. I have
     one question, Jack. On panel - on the second
     line there under LIGHTING, why are we keeping:
     the FLOODS and TRACK closed? Or are they going
     to be open?

[03:10:13:33]
CC:  Negative. We have the, LIGHTING breakers all
     closed. Control the lighting with the switches
     and rheostats. Over.

[03:10:13:44]
CDR: Okay. We don't need the floodlights, I don't
     think, but we can do it that way, I guess.

[03:10:13:51]
CC:  And under row 4, under [glossary:RCS] SYSTEMS A/B-2, QUAD
     HEATERS, you notice that we've closed those
     circuit breakers, but what we want you to do is
     to - on panel 3, turn the [glossary:RCS] A/B-2 QUAD switches
     1, 2, 3, and 4, off. Over.

[03:10:14:28]
CC:  And we're going to watch your quad temps for you,
     and when we need to warm them up a little bit,
     we'll tell you to throw those four switches on -
     on panel 3.

[03:10:14:43]
CDR: Okay. Now are we sure that this [glossary:PTC] mode is
     good enough so we don't ... get crossed up later
     and get out of configuration.

[03:10:14:53]
CC:  Stand by 1 on that, Jim. Okay, Jim, as far as
     we can tell right now, the [glossary:PTC] looks as good as
     any [glossary:PTC] we've ever seen in a [glossary:CSM], so we're going
     to go with what we've got.

[03:10:15:16]
CDR: Okay.

[03:10:15:18]
CC:  Okay, and if you turn over the page on Power 8,
     we have the spacecraft functions remaining to
     you. We've got low bit rate TM. However, we
     don't have any VHF. We have [glossary:CWEA]. We have
     GLYCOL PUMPS. We have SUIT FANS. We have
     CABIN REPRESS for you, and stand by in ATTITUDE
     CONTROL here. Okay, in ATTITUDE CONTROL, we'll
     have hardovers for uses in emergency, and for
     normal usage we want to have a 15-minute delay
     to get the heaters on to warm them up be before
     use. How do you read?

[03:10:16:06]
_page : 375
_tape : Tape 55/4
CDR: Okay. For emergency, we have the hardovers and
     for normal use it requires a 15-minute request
     to get the heaters on.

[03:10:16:16]
CC:  That's affirmative.

[03:10:16:28]
CC:  Okay, Jim, that concludes our powerdown procedure, 
     and we're waiting for you to get with it.

[03:10:16:37]
CDR: Okay, Jack, we'll start. I sure hate to lose the
     [glossary:PGNS]. I sure hope that procedure for the midcourse is a good one.

[03:10:16:45]
CC:  It is.

[03:10:16:55]
CMP: You want me to help you here?

[03:10:16:57]
CDR: Yes, you can - Okay. First we power down,
     panel 11. All of them open.

[03:10:17:15]
CDR: Closed.

[03:10:17:24]
CMP: Yes.

[03:10:17:56]
CDR: Stand by for a MASTER ALARM. ...

[03:10:17:57]
CMP: Okay.

[03:10:18:12]
CDR: Here it comes.

[03:10:18:54]
CMP: LTG. You just did it.

[03:10:19:18]
CDR: I'll give you this when I'm finished. After we
     go through this, then you can go through it again
     and doublecheck it.

[03:10:19:23]
CMP: Right.

[03:10:20:07]
CMP: Now, the flood lights are on, right? No, I kind
     of don't think we need them though, do you?

[03:10:20:15]
CDR: Don't pull those. Give me the - first of all.
     We'll get back there. Those four are close, open, open, ENGINE ARM, open, ...

[03:10:22:36]
CDR: Say, Houston; Aquarius.

[03:10:22:38]
_page : 376
_tape : Tape 55/5
CC: Go ahead, Aquarius.

[03:10:22:40]
CMP: It will take him a minute to ...

[03:10:22:43]
CDR: You're familiar with our particular spacecraft
     that on panel 16 HEATERS [glossary:RCS] SYSTEMS A and B,
     QUAD 1 HEATER circuit breaker has been pushed
     in, and sealed in, and if it's ever pushed out,
     it's doubtful if we'll ever be able to reset it.

[03:10:23:06]
CC:  Okay, Jim, on the four QUAD HEATER breakers, we
     want you to leave them closed. And we'll operate
     the heaters with the switches on panel 3. Over.

[03:10:23:19]
CDR: Okay.

[03:10:23:27]
CMP: No.

[03:10:24:07]
CDR: Okay. We'll do it right there.

[03:10:24:11]
CDR: Okay. And I'm closing the HEATERS on panel 4,
     QUAD 1 through 4, OFF.

[03:10:24:23]
CC:  Okay. It's time for you guys to get to bed and
     get Fred up.

[03:10:24:33]
CDR: (Laughter) I still have one question, Jack. I
     still think that - I still say that the - on the
     LIGHTING in our panel 16, the FLOOD lights and
     the TRACK should be open. We're not using them.

[03:10:24:48]
F: Do you have any argument about -

[03:10:24:53]
CC:  No problem, Jim. Go ahead and open them, TRACK
     and FLOOD, that's all right.

[03:10:25:03]
CMP: Okay, TRACK and FLOOD are OPEN.

[03:10:25:07]
CDR: Now, why don't you go through that, Jack, and
     make sure those - -

[03:10:25:10]
CMP: Yes.

[03:10:25:12]
CDR: - -

[03:10:25:15]
CMP: Okay, I'll take this.

[03:10:25:16]
CDR: Okay, Jack, my only other concern now is the
     CO<sub>2</sub> rise in the spacecraft. I guess you're keeping a handle on that?

[03:10:25:26]
_page : 377
_tape : Tape 55/6
CC: That's affirmed, Jim. We have you up to 10.6
     now, and we're willing to go a little higher on
     that. We have another cartridge and we have a
     procedure for making the command module cartridges
     up. We'll pass that on later.

[03:10:25:42]
CDR: Oh, yes. I'm not worried about that. I just
     wanted to make sure that you - -

[03:10:25:46]
CMP: Are they going to - -

[03:10:25:47]
CDR: - - that - We just don't want to go to sleep
     here and forget about the rise in CO<sub>2</sub>.

[03:10:25:51]
CMP: Are they going to use ... - -

[03:10:25:52]
CC:  Roger. We're watching it for you - -

[03:10:25:54]
CDR: Yes, they're getting it ...

[03:10:25:55]
CC:  - - We have it here. It's now 10.7 and we have a
     medical go to 15 millimeters.

[03:10:26:03]
CMP: That's a new one.

[03:10:26:04]
CDR: There's a new first for you.

[03:10:26:19]
CC:  Okay, Jim, we estimate we've got 1 more hour on
     the primary cartridge, and 6 or 7 hours on the secondary.

[03:10:26:31]
CDR: Okay. Fine. Say, it's a spare primary cartridge
     back there, too, isn't it? So that's good for
     another, how long?

[03:10:27:10]
CMP: Yes. Yes. That's yours though, isn't it?

[03:10:27:14]
CC:  And you're right, Jim. We've got another primary

[03:10:27:21]
CDR: Right, yes. We know. Thank you.

[03:10:27:43]
CMP: Yes, yes, I just -

[03:10:27:51]
CMP: Okay. I guess you've done everything right on
     that panel. Let me check the middle one. Yes.
     You powered down and then you leave me. Tell
     me, I've got it.

[03:10:28:05]
CC:  Okay, Jack, we just thought it's about time you
     got a [glossary:LM] checkout.

CMP: But he's giving it to me inert. Of course, I'm
     giving him my command module, too, which is rather inert right now, too.

[03:10:28:32]
CC: Well, you've got to walk before you run, you know.

[03:10:36:42]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[03:10:37:07]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[03:10:37:15]
CMP: Go ahead, Jack.

[03:10:37:19]
CC:  Roger. For your information, Jack - -

[03:10:37:20]
CMP: You're loud and clear.

[03:10:37:21]
CC:  - - all of our analysis is based on powerdown to
     14 amps, but we're reading on you right now 12.3
     and so we're better off than we were in our
     analysis.

[03:10:37:38]
CMP: That sounds good.

[03:10:38:12]
CMP: Jack, I thought you were going to get the sleep
     shift where there wasn't any excitement?

[03:10:38:18]
CC:  Well, I tried, but I didn't make it. I thought
     you were supposed to he sleeping now.

[03:10:38:31]
CMP: Well, Fred-o is getting something to eat, and
     Jim is starting to sack out so I'm taking the COMM
     here until Fred gets set.

[03:10:38:42]
CC:  Okay.

[03:10:39:19]
CMP: As I just - Yes, are you ready to take over?
     Well, he just - he just asked - said he thought
     I was supposed to be sleeping. And I told him
     that I was waiting for you to - Okay. You were
     off the NET when they explained the - But don't
     they - Can't we monitor our CDU's any more to
     tell when to switch antennas, so they've just -
     When they can see it switch - it will take a
     couple of minutes for them to get up. And
     they'll always make a voice check with you.

[03:10:40:28]
CMP: It came out here. I caught it. Okay. Now, are
     you getting squared, I'll give you the COMM
     here.

[03:10:40:42]
_page : 379
_tape : 
LMP: I don't know. [...]

[03:10:40:56]
CMP: They're, they're showing right now 12.3 amps
     Their analysis is based on 14 so they're in 
     better - Okay. Headset's yours

[03:10:42:12]
LMP: Okay, Jack. How do you read?

[03:10:42:17]
CC:  Hearing you loud and clear, Fred. OMNI.

[03:10:42:21]
LMP: Okay.

[03:10:42:22]
CC:  Okay, I heard the - -

[03:10:42:23]
LMP: I see you luck out with all the good shifts.

[03:10:42:27]
CC:  Yes, I got all the good deals. I heard Jack
     brief you on the COMM mode so, you got any questions about that?

[03:10:42:40]
LMP: Okay.

[03:10:43:06]
CC: And how is your [glossary:PTC] going? I heard Jack tell
     you that we can't see your CDU's. How's it going?

[03:10:43:17]
LMP: Well, let's see, we may be offsetting slightly,
     the Sun looks like it may be a little higher
     now. Here comes the Earth by and it looks about
     the same perspective. I'll have to wait to see
     the Moon on the other side, Jack. ...

[03:10:43:37]
CC:  Okay, Fred, I can't hear you any more on account
     of the background noise. I assume that - I think
     I heard Jack tell you what we're going to do
     about COMM. UPLINK SQUELCH, off. You'll take
     care of the antennas because we can't see your
     attitude. We'll give you a voice check when
     come up. It'll take us 3 to 5 minutes to come
     up. And to make it astronaut-proof, when you
     see the Earth, use a forward antenna; when you
     see the Moon, use the aft one.

[03:10:44:08]
LMP: Yes, that's pretty straightforward. Okay, I see
     the Earth so I've very wisely shifted to FORWARD.

[03:10:44:17]
CC:  Good boy.

[03:10:45:09]
LMP: Got another battery?

[03:10:45:12]
CMP: ... really sick.

[03:10:45:14]
_page : 380
_tape : Tape 55/9
LMP: Earth will be by over there in a minute.

[03:10:47:24]
LMP: And, Jack, you still up?

[03:10:47:28]
CC:  Still here, Fred.

[03:10:47:32]
LMP: Okay, when I was upstairs, just a minute ago, I
     noticed what appeared to be some new venting
     from down the service module way. I noticed
     that out window 1, and also saw one chunk of
     metal - loose metal about 4 inches square that
     was tumbling around - silver in color, and it,
     looked like it had come from somewhere down in
     the service module.

[03:10:48:04]
CC:  Okay. You saw some venting out window 1 - -

[03:10:48:05]
LMP: And I -

[03:10:48:08]
CC:  Go ahead.

[03:10:48:10]
LMP: Yes, that's where I happened to be looking. The
     lighting was such that it showed up out there.
     What reminded me of it was I'm looking out the
     [glossary:LM] window now and I sea a good part of the new
     star field it's created for us. There are about
     a thousand little sparklies out here.

[03:10:48:30]
CC:  Okay, so you're seeing some venting out window 1,
     and you saw a 4-inch-square piece of loose metal
     which was silver, and - Are you still seeing the
     venting or has it zeroed out now?

[03:10:48:48]
LMP: I don't know. I left upstairs, I'm down in the
     [glossary:LM] now, Jack. I guess when Jack goes up he can
     take a look and let me know. Okay, I'll think
     about switching aft here directly. I see the
     Moon, and the Moon looks pretty good, Jack, so
     I guess our [glossary:PTC] still doing pretty good.

[03:10:49:09]
CC:  Okay, and we won't have any COMM delay if the
     [glossary:PTC] stays good.

[03:10:49:32]
LMP: Yes, sure enough the Moon is getting smaller.

[03:10:49:37]
CC:  Good, and we want to ask you another question
     about the venting. Is this - would you suppose -
     some new venting or is this venting that you
     just hadn't - that's been going on all the time,
     but which you hadn't looked at recently?

[03:10:49:56]
_page : 381
_tape : Tape 55/10
LMP: I can't really say, Jack, we've been so tied up
     down in the [glossary:LM], I guess we kind of forgot about
     the other half. But I've been upstairs several
     times and hadn't particularly noticed any flow
     by the windows before, so I - my first assumption 
     was that it was some new venting. It really wasn't very heavy.

[03:10:50:23]
CC:  Okay. Copy. Thank you.

[03:10:50:25]
LMP: And Jack's going up to take a look now.

[03:10:50:27]
CC:  Okay. And for your information, all of our
     numbers are based on amperage usage of 14 amps.
     And we're using only 12.3, so we're a little
     fat on our analysis.

[03:10:50:49]
LMP: Very good. Way to be.

[03:10:50:52]
CC:  And we're in a - -

[03:10:50:53]
LMP: I'll tell you, this Aquarius has really been a
     winner.

[03:10:51:01]
CC:  Well, that's one of several. And we want to tell
     you something that I told Jim earlier, and that
     concerns control. Right now you have control in
     hardover if you need it, but when we go to some
     normal control modes, since we have the quad
     heaters off. We want to have a 15-minute notice
     for attitude control request. Over.

[03:10:51:35]
LMP: Okay, Jack. Offhand, I can't imagine that since
     we got the platform powered down why we'd need
     to worry about the instantaneous control. But
     at any rate, we need 15-minutes warmup with the
     heaters before we can start using thrusters.

[03:10:51:54]
CC:  Right. And another thing we've done is to pull
     your [glossary:ECS] and EPC DISPLAY breakers and so - But
     we left your CAUTION and WARNING powered up.
     So if you get [glossary:ECS]-type or [glossary:EPS] CAUTION and WARNING
     you'll have to power up those meters with the
     DISPLAY breakers. And we are watching for you
     your [glossary:PIPA] temperatures, your ASA TEMP, your
     propellant temperatures except for the [glossary:DPS] propellant, 
     and we're watching your quad temps for
     you.

[03:10:52:31]
LMP: Okay. That's very good, Jack. You're watching
     them. That's good enough.

[03:10:52:41]
_page : 382
_tape : Tape 55/11
CC: And everybody's fine at home El Lago.

[03:10:52:50]
LMP: Great.

[03:10:52:51]
CC:  And, Fred, your CO<sub>2</sub> is building up. 
     It's at 11 on our gage, and we've got a medical buildup to
     15 millimeters, at which time we'll switch over
     to secondary. Looks like we've got plenty of
     lithium hydroxide, about 192 hours including the
     [glossary:CSM] cartridges. And as you know, we've got a
     way to use those. And as soon as we get them
     written in some good words, why, we'll pass; that
     along. You might be able to make one.

[03:10:54:13]
LMP: Okay. Yes, we'll sure give her a try. And I'm
     showing onboard about 12-1/2 millimeters of mercury.

[03:10:54:24]
CC: Roger. And I have a flight plan update when
     you get a time to copy it sometime, I'll pass
     it along. There's no hurry on it.

[03:10:54:35]
LMP: Okay. Stand by 1. Jack's back now.

[03:10:54:48]
LMP: Okay. Jack just came hack and he said it's still
     coming out; it's only coming out on the commander's
     side. So he saw it out the same window I did,
     window 1. And it's between the minus Y and
     minus Z axis.

[03:10:55:07]
CC:  Okay. And of course - -

[03:10:55:08]
LMP: Jack says it's definitely the service module
     which was - which was my impression, too.

[03:10:55:14]
CC:  Okay. So you're sure it's the service module,
     and, of course, the thing we're interested in
     knowing, is it something that is residual from
     before, or is it something new. And if you have
     any ideas about that, why we'd sure like to have them
     them.

[03:10:55:41]
LMP: Yes. Yes, Jack, I'll answer him your question in
     a minute, but make Jack's first impression here,
     is that it's not near the intensity that it was right after our mishap.
     And I'll have to agree with that.
     I'd say - he said it was a half and
     I said it was maybe down to a third. And
     Houston would like to know if you have any impressions 
     as to whether it is still a residual
     from that or maybe something new.

[03:10:56:25]
_page : 383
_tape : Tape 55/12
LMP: I don't know why after I felt that. Yes, I felt
     it was some new something - new venting, too.

[03:10:57:06]
LMP: Okay. Switch to FORWARD OMNI.

[03:10:57:11]
CC:  Fred-o, if you think it's practical, we're ready
     to give you some - we're working on some camera
     settings for pictures of the venting. And, if
     you have a camera out and ready to go, let us
     know which one it is so we can get the settings
     for that camera. What do you think about that?

[03:10:57:30]
LMP: Okay. Jack's got the one with the 250-millimeter
     lens on it. That's the standard EL. And I have
     a surface camera out that I've been shooting
     hundreds of Earth/Moon pictures with, camera 1.
     And we also have the Reseau upstairs that's
     pretty handy. The command module DC camera.
     So you can about - -

[03:10:58:00]
CC: Okay. I copy that - -

[03:10:58:01]
LMP: - - take your choice, because - -

[03:10:58:04]
CC: I copy the 250 millimeter, the Reseau is available, 
     but I didn't get what other one is.

[03:10:58:14]
LMP: Okay. I got my Hasselblad surface camera down
     in the [glossary:LM] here handy, too, camera 1.

[03:11:00:04]
LMP: And, Jack, if we're going to do any picture taking
     out the command module windows, I think we'd better
     do that pretty quick, or hold up until Jim and
     Jack get their rest done.

[03:11:00:21]
CC:  We concur with that.

[03:11:01:23]
CC:  Okay, Fred, we're not going to bother the skipper
     up there. We won't be taking any pictures out of
     the command module window until after rest period.

[03:11:01:34]
LMP: Okay.

[03:11:10:59]
LMP: Shifting to FORWARD OMNI.

[03:11:11:44]
CC:  Okay. Fred, for your information, your CO<sub>2</sub> 
     reading onboard is a little higher than what we're
     reading here on the ground, and so when it gets
     to 15 on your meter, switch to secondary. And
     we'd like to get a status about every 30 minutes -
     we'll give you a call on that. But just to let
     us know we're still thinking about you, we'd like
     you to go BIOMED RIGHT, please.

[03:11:12:14]
_page : 384
_tape : Tape 55/13
LMP: Okay, Going BIOMED RIGHT.

[03:11:13:57]
LMP: Hey, how do you read me on this COMM mode on
     S-band?

[03:11:14:03]
CC:  5 square, Fred. How me?

[03:11:28:08]
CC:  We're still here, Fred. How's it going?

[03:11:28:11]
LMP: Okay. My CO<sub>2</sub> reading is now just below 13.

[03:11:28:21]
CC:  Say again what it is.

[03:11:28:25]
LMP: It's just - just below 13.

[03:11:28:29]
CC:  Okay. Just below 13. And just for your 
     information, we've got people working on several
     subjects. We're working on the midcourse coming
     up to determine our control system and how to do
     it with the control system we select, what we
     should do about the alinement. We've got the
     LMS and a couple of crews cranked up working on
     that. And we're also working on our entry, how
     and when we ought to activate the [glossary:CSM]. And
     we're working on the [glossary:CSM] systems status. 
     Tomorrow sometime we're going to have a MAIN BUS B
     checkout, so we've got a lot of people swinging
     pretty hard here and I've got some f-stop settings
     for you for the lunar-surface camera. At 1/250th,
     we'd like you to take targets of opportunity.
     Each picture use three f-stops, because we don't
     know exactly which one is going to work the best,
     so use 4, 5.6, and 8 and 1/250th for the surface
     camera. Copy?

[03:11:29:52]
LMP: Okay. Use the surface camera at 1/250th, 4, 5.6,
     and 8. And I've been doing quite a bit of 
     shooting at covering two of those numbers in the range
     5.6, and 8. I've also been shooting some at 11,
     so I'll just drop it down a little more. The
     Moon is still so big and bright there that I got
     a feeling that the Moon is probably up around the
     f/8 to f/11 range.

[03:11:30:26]
CC:  Roger, I didn't catch that last part. Maybe when
     the COMM gets a little better you can say it
     again.

[03:11:30:43]
LMP: Okay. How do you read now, Jack?

[03:11:30:45]
CC:  That's a lot better, Fred.

[03:11:30:48]
_page : 385
_tape : Tape 55/14
LMP: Okay, I just said the Moon is still so bright,
     that I think probably the higher range of f-stops
     will be better; f/8, maybe even f/11.

[03:11:31:02]
CC: Okay.

[03:11:31:11]
LMP: I can just barely, on the left corner of the Moon
     now, make out the foothills of Fra Mauro 
     formation. We never did get to see it when we were in close, there.

[03:11:31:33]
CC:  Okay. I'm reading on my monitor here, Fred, that
     you're 16214 miles away from the Moon moving at
     about 4500 feet per second.

[03:11:31:56]
LMP: Okay.

[03:11:32:21]
LMP: From the sounds of all the work that is going
     on and is still going on, this flight is probably
     a lot bigger test for the system on the ground than up here.

[03:11:32:41]
CC:  Yes, you've been - you've been working it out a
     little bit.

[03:11:32:55]
LMP: Yes. I've really got a tough job right now
     switching OMNIs.

[03:11:33:08]
CC:  Well, everybody down here is 100-percent
     optimistic. Looks like we're on the up side of the whole thing now.

[03:11:33:21]
LMP: Yes, I guess we had better be in good shape,
     particularly ourselves, rested for that entry
     day. I think that is going to be a pretty busy one.

[03:11:33:33]
CC:  Right, and we're working on procedures for that.
     Ken's been doing quite a bit of work on getting
     ready for entry.

[03:11:33:47]
_extra : END OF TAPE
LMP: Very good.

[03:11:47:12]
_page : 386
_tape : Tape 56/1
CC: How's it going, Fred?

[03:11:47:18]
LMP: Okay. Just fine.

[03:11:47:20]
CC:  Okay. We're considering a midcourse correction
     at 104 hours - about 20 hours from now - 18 hours
     from now, and it's only 7 feet per second. The
     other option is to keep [glossary:PTC] up, since we may not
     be able to get back into it again, and delay it.
     So, that's the type of thing we're thinking about,
     but - just wanted to let you know that you're
     pretty much right in the middle of the fairway
     there and our present tracking, with no midcourse,
     has you - with a Gamma of 7.11, as opposed to
     6.51. So, you're already in the corridor. You're
     just a half a degree between the center and the
     outer limits and we're going to tweek that up.

[03:11:48:15]
LMP: Okay. That sounds good.

[03:11:48:20]
CC:  And - we don't - Well, we think there might have
     been a misunderstanding earlier on the potable
     water. Don't worry about drinking water. Drink
     all you want. There's plenty of it. There's
     38 pounds, and the Surgeon recommends that you
     use some of the fruit juices as well. Over.

[03:11:48:43]
LMP: Okay. Yes, we went up and - and used the
     procedure to pressurize surge tank, and Jack and I
     made up a total of 22 drinks of - drinking water.

[03:11:49:02]
CC:  Okay.

[03:11:49:19]
CC:  And I assume that Jack is up there sleeping now
     too, right?

[03:11:49:26]
LMP: Yes. That's affirm. They're both up there.

[03:11:49:40]
LMP: I hate to say it, Jack, but I think our [glossary:PTC] is
     about to wobble off a little bit. I've noticed
     that the Earth is coming by somewhat lower in
     the window and the Moon is going by somewhat
     higher.

[03:11:49:59]
CC:  Okay. Understand. [glossary:PTC], Earth is coming by
     lower and Moon is coming by higher.

[03:11:50:09]
LMP: Yes.

[03:11:51:58]
_page : 387
_tape : Tape 56/2
CC: And, Fred, on this jerry-rigged command module
     lithium hydroxide canister, what we're going to
     do is we're going to have to make at least two
     up and use two at a time - one on each set of
     hoses. What we'll do is we'll connect one of
     these jerry-rigged boxes to the red fittings and
     air will be sucked through the lithium hydroxide
     and then blown out the blue fitting. And we're
     also going to, when we do this, remove the [glossary:LM]
     lithium hydroxide canister from the suit loop,
     either the primary or the secondary, and we're
     getting the words together to make it easy to
     build one of these things, and it looks like it
     will probably take two guys, so, I think we
     probably ought to plan to do that later. In
     addition, we have to go up and get a couple of
     canisters out of the command module, so it looks
     like maybe a smart idea would be to delay a little
     bit and have you build a couple of these later on.
     What do you think?

[03:11:53:17]
LMP: Yes. I agree, Jack. Jack Swigert and I went
     upstairs earlier and both got a canister, and
     we were scratching around for some material and
     thinking about using them, and that's actually
     why - when we made up all the water to drink
     because we needed the plastic container that they
     were housed in in the pantry, and we had that
     ready to use with some material plus some of the -
     the extra porous bags that were going to be used
     for the dump control that we may just cut up and
     use, too.

[03:11:53:54]
CC:  Did you come up with a design or - -

[03:11:53:56]
CDR: Plus we got lots - -

[03:11:54:00]
LMP: No. We just thought we'd see what we had in the
     way of material and stand by for your word. Of
     course, we also have lots of stiff-backed cardboard flight data.

[03:11:54:15]
CC:  Yes. We have decided to use a canister and, you
     know that the liquid-cooled garment has a bag
     around it that we think we can use, too, or that
     we know we can use. We've tried it. So what you
     have is the - a bag within a bag and inside that
     is the liquid-cooled garment. The bag that is
     closest to the liquid-cooled garment is the one
     we need, and we've got two of them. And then,
     of course, we've got to use some tape and, as
     you say, one of the backs to flight data file
     time line book or something like that, and, just
     using those materials, we can make this 
     jerry-rigged canister. So, the bag that we're looking
     for is the one that is right next to the 
     liquid-cooled garment, and, if we're very careful about
     where we cut it, we can make a pretty good rig.

[03:11:55:28]
_page : 388
_tape : Tape 56/3
LMP: Okay.

[03:11:55:31]
CC:  It looks like we'll have to use that bag over
     again, though, because we only got two of them,
     and I expect that we'll have to make more than
     two of these canisters up.

[03:11:55:44]
LMP: Roger.

[03:11:56:35]
CC:  Fred, in about 4 minutes, we're going to hand you
     over to a different communications site, and it's
     going to take us about a minute or so to 
     reestablish uplink, so you can be prepared for that.

[03:11:56:51]
LMP: Okay, Jack.

[03:12:00:40]
CC:  Fred-o, we've handed over now. How do you read?

[03:12:00:46]
LMP: Loud and clear, Jack.

[03:12:00:48]
CC:  Same here.

[03:12:00:56]
LMP: In fact, you're coming in a little louder.

[03:12:01:03]
CC:  Fred, you'll have to say again. Can't read you
     there. There's too much background noise.
     Maybe we need a new antenna.

[03:12:01:14]
LMP: Okay. I'm on the other OMNI now. I just said
     that you're coming in even louder than previously.

[03:12:01:24]
CC:  Roger. Maybe it's because I'm standing up. You're
     coming in better now, too.

[03:12:04:46]
LMP: And, for your information, Jack, I'm just going
     to tear into some beef and gravy and other assorted goodies.

[03:12:05:01]
CC:  I presume that you're doing this with the full
     permission and - of the commander.

[03:12:05:19]
LMP: And this - at this moment, who do you think is
     the commander?

[03:12:05:31]
_page : 389
_tape : Tape 56/4
CC:  If I was him, I'd make you sign out everything
     you ate, so I'd know.

[03:12:05:56]
LMP: Well, I'm sneaking inside of the [glossary:LM] where he
     doesn't have ... Incidentally, this [glossary:PTC] must
     have some - must have a wobble mode around our
     X-axis there because now the Moon and Earth are
     back in the right perspective.

[03:12:06:18]
CC:  Good. Let's see if it goes the other way.

[03:12:06:40]
CC: These guys down here are saying they knew it all
     the time.

[03:12:06:56]
LMP: Well, that's right. They do good work. Whoever
     heard of doing a [glossary:P52] in the [glossary:LM]?

[03:12:08:48]
CC:  Say, Fred, sometime when you're not too busy
     chewing on that beef, how about telling us what
     the CO<sub>2</sub> reads?

[03:12:09:03]
LMP: Okay, I'm reading 13, 1 3.

[03:12:09:07]
CC:  Okay. It looks like our reading is getting kind
     of close to yours.

[03:12:14:39]
LMP: Yes. It appears the wobble is going the other
     way, Jack, because the Earth is now rising and
     the Moon is starting to get lower in the window.

[03:12:14:52]
CC:  Roger. Could you give us an [glossary:LPD] number
     periodically?

[03:12:15:02]
LMP: [glossary:LPD] number? Yes, okay.

[03:12:15:09]
CC:  In fact, if you could give it two or three REVs
     in a row, why then we could predict where it's
     going and maybe help us set it up again if we
     have to.

[03:12:15:22]
LMP: Okay.

[03:12:15:36]
LMP: Okay. The center of the Earth has just gone by
     at an [glossary:LPD] number of 4.

[03:12:15:42]
CC:  Roger. [glossary:LPD] 4, center of the Earth.

[03:12:20:59]
LMP: And the center of the Moon is about [glossary:LPD] 21.

[03:12:21:04]
CC:  Okay. [glossary:LPD] 21. Is that the center of the Moon,
     you say?

[03:12:21:11]
_page : 390
_tape : 
LMP: That's affirm.

[03:12:22:52]
CC:  And, Fred, we're doing a little better on our
     water than we had anticipated. Our numbers
     were designed for 3.5 pounds per hour; we're
     using about 3.0, and expect to go a little bit
     less.

[03:12:23:11]
LMP: Beautiful.

[03:12:23:32]
LMP: When this flight's all over, we'll really be able
     to figure out what a [glossary:LM] can do.

[03:12:24:02]
CC:  Maybe it'll make the ...

[03:12:24:09]
LMP: If it had a heat shield, I'd say bring it home.

[03:12:27:18]
LMP: Okay. The Earth went - just went by about - clear
     above the [glossary:LPD] index. It was - it was, if it
     were extended, the number would be minus 6.

[03:12:27:34]
CC:  Okay. Way up there at minus 6.

[03:12:27:41]
LMP: Yes, there's actually no such number. I just
     extended the line beyond zero which, for a negative rate, is 
     what it would be if there was one.

[03:12:27:53]
CC:  Right. If minus 6 was there, that's where it
     would be. Right?

[03:12:28:02]
LMP: That's right.

[03:12:28:13]
CC:  Do you still have that super-dense star field?

[03:12:28:25]
LMP: It's still there. I'm looking at it right now.
     I can look at - the Sun is right behind me,
     then all these sparklies show up. Yes. It kind
     of looks like I'm right in the middle of the - of
     the Milky Way. There are several thousand little
     sparklies at various ranges out as far as I can
     see ...

[03:12:29:18]
LMP: They're kind of interesting. They're all moving
     ... and sparkling there. And I can ... - at
     least I think I can what will occasionally give
     you a real star from the bunch of sparklies,
     but it really does break up the capability to
     pick out a star pattern, particularly through ...

[03:12:29:52]
CC:  Okay. So far, we haven't identified what the
     sparklies are and what is venting.

[03:12:30:12]
_page : 391
_tape : Tape 56/6
LMP: Yes, I got a. ... feeling that we probably won't
     get any ... until we power up.

[03:12:34:08]
CC:  How you feeling, Fred?

[03:12:34:16]
LMP: Oh, as soon as I chug down this grape drink and
     grapefruit - orange drink, I think I'll be in pretty good shape.

[03:12:34:38]
CC:  How much sleep did you get between the burn and
     the time you got up for this exercise?

[03:12:34:50]
LMP: Oh, I'd guesstimate about 4 hours, Jack. Wait a
     minute, which burn you talking about?

[03:12:35:03]
CC:  It was the burn we just made. Did you get any
     sleep between it, and the time you got up for this watch?

[03:12:35:12]
LMP: Oh, no. I didn't - I haven't been to bed since
     all the action the night before, and I went to
     go to bed for about 4 hours then ...

[03:12:35:22]
CC:  Yes.

[03:12:35:38]
CC:  Well, we're just trying to figure out who's
     likely to be the most tired up there. You or Jim.

[03:12:35:55]
LMP: I think we'll get caught up pretty good in the
     next couple of days.

[03:12:36:00]
CC:  Say again.

[03:12:36:04]
LMP: We ought to get caught up pretty good in the
     next couple of days.

[03:12:38:56]
LMP: Okay, Jack. The Earth has started back down.
     The hack on the [glossary:LPD] there was 1 degree.

[03:12:39:06]
CC:  Okay. One degree on the center of the Earth.

[03:12:42:13]
CC:  That was a good TV show you put on the other
     night, Fred, during [glossary:LM] entry.

[03:12:42:26]
LMP: Yes. It would have been an even better one about
     10 minutes later.

[03:12:42:50]
CC:  Yes. Things sure turned to worms there in a
     hurry after that show.

[03:12:43:12]
_page : 392
_tape : Tape 56/7
LMP: Yes. You're right.

[03:12:43:28]
LMP: Okay. The center of the Moon new is about
     minus 2 degrees LPD.

[03:12:43:35]
CC:  Minus 2 degrees, center of the Moon.

[03:12:44:44]
CC:  Charlie said to say hello.

[03:12:44:51]
LMP: Who's that?

[03:12:44:53]
CC: Charlie.

[03:12:44:58]
LMP: Is he still around there?

[03:12:45:16]
LMP: Unless my watch is wrong, it says it's almost
     2 a.m. back there.

[03:12:45:22]
CC:  No. That's the bearded one.

[03:12:45:29]
LMP: Oh! Okay.

[03:12:46:15]
LMP: Hey, tell Charlie that I'll be back down there
     personally to thank him for this baby.

[03:12:46:28]
CC:  Sure will. I did.

[03:12:50:21]
LMP: Okay. The Earth went by there, Jack, at [glossary:LPD]
     about 18 degrees.

[03:12:50:28]
CC:  Roger. We copy 18 degrees for the center of the
     Earth.

[03:12:53:56]
LMP: Okay. The Moon - I'd estimate it up around
     minus - somewhere 17 to minus 20 degrees [glossary:LPD].

[03:12:54:07]
CC:  Okay. Moon's minus 17 to minus 20.

[03:12:55:14]
CC:  How would you like to spend a week on an 
     aircraft carrier getting back?

[03:12:55:28]
LMP: If I can get on an aircraft carrier, I don't
     care how long it takes, Jack.

[03:12:56:28]
CC:  They're going to take you by helo to Samoa.
     You'll spend the night in Samoa, get on a 141,
     and be at Ellington shortly thereafter.

[03:12:56:46]
LMP: Okay. Kind of sounds like the original plans
     for the ...

[03:12:57:24]
_page : 393
_tape : Tape 56/8
CC: Had you worrying that you're going to spend the
     night on the ship, helo to Samoa and directly to Ellington.

[03:12:57:35]
LMP: Very good.

[03:12:58:27]
LMP: Boy, these thrusters are sure ... ...

[03:12:58:35]
CC:  Fred, I'm not reading you. Maybe we'd better
     wait until we change antennas or unless you can
     speak up a little louder.

[03:12:58:43]
LMP: How do you read now?

[03:12:58:45]
CC:  Better.

[03:12:58:49]
LMP: Okay. The thrusters ... and the ... outside ...
     and they hardly look like they ... ...

[03:12:59:12]
CC:  Gee, I'm sorry, Fred. We're just not reading you
     right now. Maybe we'll have to wait a little bit.

[03:12:59:20]
LMP: Okay.

[03:12:59:29]
CC:  Let's try it now. If you can speak up, the
     background noise has gone down a little bit.

[03:12:59:37]
LMP: Okay. How do you read now?

[03:12:59:39]
CC:  A little better.

[03:12:59:44]
LMP: I was just commenting - I've been looking here
     at the thrusters on quads 1 and 4. We've got a
     slight discoloration on the outside of the barrel.
     The nozzles look like they hadn't ever been
     fired, - like they're brand new. ... of like
     those skinny things on the interior on the upper
     nozzle ...

[03:13:00:14]
CC:  You say the coloration of the thrusters appears
     they haven't been fired on quads 1 and 4?

[03:13:00:24]
LMP: I'm saying all of them look clean again. I guess
     they've fired so clean that they don't seem to ...
     at all. ... different color, ... copper, bronze,
     color of the oxygen cell. They've been fired because I watched 
     them fire. Okay. The Earth's going by at an [glossary:LPD] of 42.

[03:13:00:58]
CC:  Roger. Copy [glossary:LPD] 42. Is that affirm?

[03:13:01:03]
_page : 394
_tape : Tape 56/9
LMP: That's affirm.

[03:13:01:17]
CC:  And, Fred, that may be why the COMM is a little
     bit degraded, more background noise, because
     we're getting out of attitude a little bit there.

[03:13:01:28]
LMP: Roger.

[03:13:03:38]
LMP: How do you read on AFT OMNI now ...?

[03:13:03:43]
CC:  I'm reading you, Fred. I've got a lot of 
     background noise. Looks like it might come and go
     with attitude.

[03:13:03:54]
LMP: Yes. I think that's probably - just looking
     through the command module at you now.

[03:13:04:45]
LMP: How do you read now, Jack?

[03:13:04:47]
CC:  About the same, Fred.

[03:13:04:52]
LMP: Okay.

[03:13:05:08]
LMP: Okay. And the Moon just went by at about
     minus 14 degrees.

[03:13:05:13]
CC:  Okay, the Moon at minus 14.

[03:13:05:24]
LMP: That - that's correct.

[03:13:05:28]
CC:  Okay. Your landing in - your weather in the
     landing area, which is about 560 miles south of
     Samoa, is now predicted to be about 1500,
     scattered, high broken. Waves are going to be
     5 feet, the winds are going to be 15 knots,
     visibility 20 miles, showers in less than 10 percent of the 
     area, and you will be landing at 08:00 local, roughly.

[03:13:06:04]
LMP: Hey, that all sounds pretty good.

[03:13:08:29]
CC:  Say, Fred, did you get the dope on the Saturn IV
     impact - [glossary:S-IVB] impact?

[03:13:08:41]
LMP: Yes. Just as we came around the corner, Vance,
     they told us that it hit - I don't recall the
     position now, but it was a ... impact ... and
     recorded it on the ... seismometer.

[03:13:09:04]
CC:  Yes. It impacted 74 nautical miles from the [glossary:ALSEP]
     and the passive seismic detected major seismic
     activity on all long period channels and this
     was - this activity was detected for 4 hours
     afterwards with decreasing amplitude. And the
     impact also was detected by the high-energy
     channels ... The high-energy channel of the
     [glossary:SIDE].

[03:13:09:58]
_extra : END OF TAPE
_page : 395
_tape : Tape 56/10
LMP: Yes. That ought to add ...

[03:13:11:42]
_page : 396
_tape : Tape 57/1
LMP: Okay. The Earth [glossary:LPD] number that time was 32.

[03:13:11:48]
CC:  Roger. Thirty-two.

[03:13:14:57]
LMP: How do you read now, Jack?

[03:13:15:02]
CC:  I'm reading you, Fred. I've got a lot of
     background noise, though.

[03:13:15:08]
LMP: Jack, I can definitely tell we're moving away
     from the Moon, now. I got it all in the
     monocular at one time. We're right over the
     top of FPA 8 right now.

[03:13:15:23]
CC:  You're right over the top of what?

[03:13:15:24]
LMP: On a point between it and Censorinus - FPA 8 and -
     the point halfway between there and Censorinus.

[03:13:15:46]
CC:  Fred-o, would say the checkpoint over which
     you're right now?

[03:13:15:56]
LMP: Okay. And incidentally, the LPD on the
     Moon was zero, so it's coming back down. The
     point looks like we're just about straight over
     is around Censorinus and the point between it
     and FPA 8.

[03:13:16:19]
CC:  Okay.

[03:13:22:07]
LMP: Okay. And, Jack, the Earth [glossary:LPD] angle is
     24 degrees.

[03:13:22:14]
CC:  Roger. Earth at 24. And it looks like you're
     getting up to about 15 on the CO<sub>2</sub>, so we want
     you to select SECONDARY and swap out the primary
     cartridge. Over.

[03:13:22:30]
LMP: Okay. I'll select SECONDARY and swap out the
     primary cartridge.

[03:13:22:53]
CC:  Okay, Fred. And when you select - When you
     swap out the primary cartridge, don't reselect
     PRIMARY. Stay on SECONDAARY until we use the
     secondary up. Over.

[03:13:23:10]
LMP: Okay. I'm changing out primary and - stay in
     SECONDARY until we use it up.

[03:13:29:43]
_page : 397
_tape : Tape 37/2
LMP: And the change out is complete, Jack.

[03:13:29:50]
CC:  Okay. Copy the changeout complete, and we're
     reading 4.5 on the CO<sub>2</sub> here.

[03:13:30:01]
LMP: Okay. I'm ...

[03:13:32:21]
LMP: Okay. And the Earth [glossary:LPD] was 8 degrees.

[03:13:32:25]
CC:  Did you - Did you say 8 degrees, Fred?

[03:13:32:31]
LMP: Affirmative.

[03:13:32:34]
CC:  Okay.

[03:13:36:52]
LMP: Well, I missed the Moon on that one, Jack. But
     I would guess - estimating back a little bit,
     the [glossary:LPD] angle was somewhere around 42.

[03:13:37:03]
CC:  Fred, I'm having a hard time reading you, but I
     think you're giving me a [glossary:LPD] angle.

[03:13:37:12]
LMP: Roger. That's it, Jack. The Moon is about 42.

[03:13:37:16]
CC:  You say the Moon is at 22?

[03:13:37:23]
LMP: Four two, 42.

[03:13:37:24]
CC:  Okay, 4 2. Thank you.

[03:13:50:27]
CC:  How you doing there, Fred?

[03:13:50:33]
CDR: ...

[03:13:50:51]
CC:  Okay, Fred. I can just barely hear you saying
     something in the background and I can't make out
     what it is.

[03:13:51:02]
CDR: Hello, Houston; Aquarius.

[03:13:51:06]
CC:  Hello there, Aquarius. Go ahead.

[03:13:51:11]
CDR: Roger. And Fred is being relieved now. He's -
     went back to get some rest. This is Lovell here
     who's got the duty.

[03:13:51:21]
CC:  Gee whiz. You got up kind of early, didn't you?

[03:13:51:28]
CDR: It's cold back there in the command module.

[03:13:51:38]
_page : 398
_tape : Tape 57/3
CC: Well, what we were really thinking about doing
     was letting you sleep a little bit longer
     because we figure you're pretty worn out.

[03:13:51:55]
CDR: Well, I'll go back and forth once in a while to
     get a ...

[03:13:52:01]
CC:  Is Jack up there with you?

[03:13:52:08]
CDR: No, Jack's still sacked out.

[03:13:52:41]
CC:  Okay, Jim. We're kind of watching this [glossary:PTC] a
     little bit. Fred's been giving us a few [glossary:LPD]
     angles as we swang by the center of the Earth -
     center of the Moon. We noticed that the COMM
     has been degrading just a little bit so you
     might have to talk up.

[03:13:53:09]
CDR: Roger. Understand.

[03:13:53:11]
CC:  And we just went on to the secondary CO<sub>2</sub>
     canister. Fred swapped out the primary, but we
     want to stay on the secondary until it is all
     used up.

[03:13:53:30]
CDR: Okay. I'm going to use the tape ... CO<sub>2</sub>.

[03:13:53:42]
CC:  We're reading a partial pressure CO<sub>2</sub> of 4.2 millimeters.
     We're cleared to use the secondary until
     it reaches 15.

[03:13:53:57]
CDR: Okay. That's good.

[03:14:01:47]
CC:  Aquarius, in comparing our initial estimates of
     water usage and electrical power usage, it appears
     that we're right on the money on water usage, and
     we're using a little less amperes than we had
     originally expected in our first analysis, so we're
     either right on the money or just a little bit
     ahead of the game in that regard.

[03:14:02:18]
CDR: Well, that sounds encouraging, Jack.

[03:14:02:24]
CC:  And there are a few temperatures that we're
     watching for you. You have the heaters powered
     down. We're looking at them, and those include
     the [glossary:PIPA]s, the ASA, the quad temps, and your
     propellants, except for the [glossary:DPS] propellant.

[03:14:02:49]
_page : 399
_tape : Tape 57/4
CDR: Okay. I've got them here.

[03:14:03:02]
CC:  We have, as you probably know, several groups
     working on procedures from here on out. We
     have a group working on midcourse corrections
     to determine a system, the attitudes, how to do
     it, alinement techniques, and so forth. We have
     a group working on the entry, including how
     and when we're going to activate the [glossary:CSM]. We
     have a group working on the [glossary:CSM] system status,
     and in a few hours - Later on tomorrow, from
     where we see it, we're going to go to some base
     configuration on the [glossary:CSM] and we're going to
     conduct a MAIN BUS B check. Right now the COMM
     is kind of degrading, and I can't hear what
     you're about to say very well. But I just want
     to keep you advised as to how things are going
     here. And remember you've got duty on the
     antennas.

[03:14:05:00]
CC:  Aquarius, are you reading Houston?

[03:14:05:04]
CDR: ...

[03:14:05:10]
CC:  Okay, Jim. I can hear you talking but I can't
     tell what you're saying because you're way down
     in the background noise.

[03:14:05:20]
CDR: Okay. Can you hear Aquarius now? Over.

[03:14:05:23]
CC:  Oh, yes. That's much better. Did you get my
     report on the various types of people and what
     they're doing around here?

[03:14:05:30]
CDR: Roger. Sounds like you had things well organized.
     You might also consider what kind of a stowage
     configuration ... and what we can leave behind
     in Aquarius.

[03:14:05:50]
CC:  Okay, Jim. I didn't catch that suggestion on
     account of the background noise; maybe we can
     pass it on when it gets more favorable.

[03:14:06:07]
CDR: I'm thinking in terms of stowage. Whether we
     would leave the suit. ... the Hycon camera in
     Aquarius, prior to ...

[03:14:06:26]
CC:  Okay. I heard you say something about using the
     Hycon camera in Aquarius.

[03:14:06:36]
_page : 400
_tape : Tape 57/5
CDR: Negative, Jack. I'm thinking of reentry stowage
     attitude. Whether we should - what we should
     leave behind in Aquarius. Leave the suits behind;
     leaving such big items as the Hycon cameras in
     Aquarius. Over.

[03:14:06:53]
CC:  Oh, understand. You're thinking about stowage.
     What'll we leave behind in Aquarius when we fall
     back into Odyssey. Is that right?

[03:14:07:04]
CDR: That's affirmative.

[03:14:07:06]
CC:  Okay. We've people working on that, too.

[03:14:07:26]
CC:  And we presently are tracking you at 22 500 miles
     from the Moon, moving out at 4400 feet a second.

[03:14:07:43]
CDR: Aquarius. Roger.

[03:14:10:36]
CC:  And, Jim, earlier in the evening, we thought there
     was a misunderstanding about the amount of potable
     water you can drink, but we want to advise you
     that you can drink as much water as you want to.
     There's 38 pounds in the potable tank, and that's
     about all you'll need. The doctors suggest you
     drink as much fruit juices as you want, too.

[03:14:11:02]
CDR: Roger, Jack.

[03:14:13:52]
CC:  Jim, earlier in the evening, Fred-o reported some
     venting out of window number 1 in the command
     module. He also reported a piece of loose metal
     about 4 inches square, silver, floating by, and
     one thing we were trying to establish is whether
     or not this is a new venting or whether this is
     part of the residual venting of our original
     problem. Do you have any more words or comments?
     And one thing he was doing was taking some
     photographs and we authorized photographs,
     targets of opportunity, using the lunar-surface
     camera number 1, and use the setting of 1/250 of
     a second, and not knowing precisely what f-stop to
     use, we suggested taking three of each, using
     settings of f:4, f:5.6, and f:8. Over.

[03:14:14:57]
CDR: Roger, Jack. The venting really seems to ... I
     reported earlier, I also spotted the large piece
     go by and prior to our ... burn ... The venting
     you see now is much greater ... went into the
     dark mode, you could easily distinguish stars
     and didn't have the bright articles and bright
     objects, and I also have the camera here to take
     photographs. ...

[03:14:16:09]
_page : 401
_tape : Tape 57/6
CC:  Okay, Jim. Once again I hear you talking back
     there but I can only pick out a few words; maybe
     we'll have a better time.

[03:14:16:54]
CC:  Aquarius, we're trying to improve our communications.
     Could you turn the BIOMED off and give us
     a voice check, please?

[03:14:17:09]
CDR: Voice check follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1;
     voice check out.

[03:14:17:18]
CC:  Okay, Jim. That seemed to be better.

[03:14:31:02]
CC:  How are you doing there, Aquarius?

[03:14:31:08]
CDR: We're doing good, Jack.

[03:14:31:10]
CC:  Okay. Sometime when you get two guys available
     there and you could construct one of these
     lithium hydroxide rigs, I'd like to have you get
     the materials together, and we'll go through the
     steps together.

[03:14:31:28]
CDR: Okay. Sounds good. And how do you read me now?

[03:14:31:33]
CC:  Well, there is a lot of background noise, and
     sometimes it is worse than others and right now
     I hear you better than I have in the past.

[03:14:31:45]
CDR: Okay, Jack. I'm kind of curious the amount of
     perturbations our [glossary:PTC] attitude is taking. I
     notice that we are getting off attitude, and I'm
     just kind of curious how far we can let this go.

[03:14:32:03]
CC:  We were tracking the attitudes with Fred earlier
     and it looked like what we were doing was oscillating
     about some point, but coming back. Are
     you detecting some kind of divergence now?

[03:14:32:21]
CDR: Not too much. I notice that it's different than
     when I went to sleep. We are more at an angle
     now with the terminator of the Earth, so when we
     started out, we were just about parallel with
     the terminator, and now we are canted off somewhat.
     I haven't seen any trends, though, of going back
     and forth.

[03:14:33:08]
_page : 402
_tape : Tape 57/7
CC:  And, Jim, our current plan is to not correct the
     [glossary:PTC]. We're going to take whatever we get and
     live with it. And we can kind of keep track of
     what's going on a little better if when you
     swing past the Earth and swing past the center
     of the Moon, if you could read off the [glossary:LPD]
     angles for the center of the Earth and the center
     of the Moon. Over.

[03:14:33:34]
CDR: Roger. Will do, Jack. And I'm looking into the
     [glossary:AOT] now to the right - No, the number 4 detent,
     and we are venting something back there; I can
     see particles moving on past the command module.
     What it is, I don't know.

[03:14:33:59]
CC:  Okay. Can you identify the quadrant?

[03:14:34:18]
CDR: Well, I'm looking through the right rear reticle
     now of the [glossary:AOT], and when I was back in the command
     mmodule, I could see it out of the [glossary:CM] 1 window.
     The particles are rather small, but they are
     coming out with some force. That's probably what
     is disturbing our [glossary:PTC] attitude.

[03:14:34:50]
CC:  Yes, that sounds quite probable, Jim. That's
     about the same report we got from Fred, but we
     haven't been able to identify what they might be
     and probably won't be able to until we crank up
     the [glossary:CSM]. If there's any change in that status,
     why, we just want to keep advised of it.

[03:14:35:11]
CDR: Roger. Understand.

[03:14:36:09]
CC:  And, Aquarius, we are setting a pretty good vector
     on you now. And it looks like you're a little
     bit outside of the corridor. We're looking at a
     7-foot-per-second midcourse at 104 hours. We
     are going to come up with an entry interface minus
     8 pad to use in the event of a loss of COMM situation

[03:14:36:39]
CDR: Roger. Understand, and I hope you have that procedure for attitude.

[03:14:36:48]
CC:  We are ginning up a procedure for attitude for
     you, Jim. For the no-COMM case, it may be a
     little different than what the guys working on
     the procedures come up with for the burn at
     104 hours.

[03:14:37:09]
CDR: Roger.

[03:14:37:36]
_page : 403
_tape : Tape 57/8
CC:  What I'm saying, Jim, is the guys who are
     working on this attitude situation for the burns
     haven't made their final conclusions yet, but in
     the interim period, we want to come up with
     something you can use, in the event that you
     lose COMM.

[03:14:37:53]
CDR: I concur.

[03:14:40:54]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius. The Earth is going through
     the 10-degree line or angle of the [glossary:LPD].

[03:14:41:02]
CC:  Okay, We copied 10 degrees. Is that Earth or
     Moon, Jim?

[03:14:41:08]
CDR: That is Earth.

[03:14:41:10]
_extra : END OF TAPE
CC:  Okay. Earth 10 degrees. Thank you.

[03:14:45:53]
_page : 404
_tape : Tape 58/1
CDR: And, Houston ... As we ... No! ... has an angle
     of about 24 degrees on the [glossary:LPD].

[03:14:46:03]
CC:  Okay. We read 24, Jim.

[03:14:46:09]
CDR: That's affirm.

[03:14:53:46]
CDR: Jack, ... the [glossary:LPD] on the Moon now is 22 degrees.

[03:14:53:51]
CC:  Okay. I'm reading you better, Jim. Say again,
     please.

[03:14:53:57]
CDR: Roger. The [glossary:LPD] now on the Moon is 22 degrees.
     I missed the Earth last time. I'll get it this
     time.

[03:14:54:04]
CC:  Okay. Twenty-two degrees, and looks like we've
     come up with a procedure for the attitude control
     on the upcoming burns. Probably the ones that
     we'll use from here on out.

[03:14:54:23]
CDR: Okay, Jack. Stand by 1.

[03:14:54:30]
CC:  It's going to be a few minutes before I'm ready
     to read it up to you.

[03:14:54:38]
CDR: Okay.

[03:14:59:23]
CDR: Jack, on the first of the [glossary:LPD] angles is about a
     minus 2 degrees and just slightly above the top
     line.

[03:14:59:36]
CC:  Okay. Just went by minus 2 degrees. Is that on
     the Earth?

[03:14:59:43]
CDR: That's the Earth. Now, I don't know whether
     we're oscillating back and forth or not, Jack,
     or whether it's a continual motion. We'll have
     to see here.

[03:14:59:52]
CC:  Roger.

[03:15:02:35]
CDR: Okay, Jack. The Moon now has an [glossary:LPD] angle of
     10 degrees

[03:15:03:01]
CC:  Roger. The Moon at 10 degrees.

[03:15:04:24]
_extra : burn, I'd like to say that we're going
_page : 405
_tape : Tape 58/2
CC:  Okay, Jim. Just as kind of a lead-in to this
     procedure that we're going to use for the mid-course
     to use [glossary:AGS] and it's going to be a manual burn.
     The attitude will be controlled manually; the
     start/stop on the engine will be controlled manually.
     So we have a pretty good vector on you
     now, and it turns out you're coming in a little
     bit too shallow. So what that means is we're
     going to make our burn to come in a little more
     steeply, and we're going to be coming in around
     the dark side of the Earth. Therefore, to come
     in more steep, our thrust should be in the direction
     of the Sun. Does that all make sense
     to you?

[03:15:05:29]
CDR: I think so. We're going to use [glossary:AGS] for a burn
     monitor. The burns are going to be manual, and
     they're going to be started manually and stopped
     manually.

[03:15:05:40]
CC:  Okay. And your reentry is around the dark side
     of the Earth, and since we're coming in shallow,
     we're going to have to burn toward the Sun to
     make it steeper. Do you follow that?

[03:15:06:05]
CDR: That's affirm. Especially these burns will be
     perpendicular to our flight path and to the Sun
     giving a steeper entry angle.

[03:15:06:28]
CC:  Okay, Jim. I heard you say perpendicular to
     your flight path, which is affirmative, and I
     didn't get the rest of your statement.

[03:15:06:46]
CDR: I understand the technique, Jack. We're burning
     to give us time to steepen our entry angle, and
     it will be perpendicular to our flight path for
     corridor control.

[03:15:07:01]
CC:  Okay. That's affirmative. So, in general terms,
     what we're going to have to do is to power up
     the [glossary:AGS] and bring up the [glossary:AGS] eight-ball, and
     then to set up your attitude, put the [glossary:COAS] in
     the front window, and guidance control will be
     in [glossary:AGS], of course. But manually orient the
     spacecraft to place the center of the Earth
     directly out the Z-axis. Then rotate about the
     Z-axis to place the point of the crescent on the
     Y-axis of the [glossary:COAS]. And this will have your
     plus X-axis in the direction of the Sun as we
     discussed before. So the crescent will be up
     with the point down. Copy that?

[03:15:08:19]
_extra : to get our X-axis pointing toward the Sun.
_page : 406
_tape : Tape 58/3
CDR: Okay, Jack. We'll have to go over what again.
     The [glossary:COAS] will be out front window; we'll place
     the Earth in the center of the [glossary:COAS], and, let's
     see, the center of the Earth right now is parallel
     to the [glossary:LPD] which is about parallel to our
     X-axis. And we'll have to rotate about 90 degrees

[03:15:09:14]
CC:  Okay, Jim. So we want to get the Y-axis of the
     spacecraft parallel to the terminator by putting
     the points of the crescent on the Y-axis.

[03:15:09:35]
CDR: Roger. Understand.

[03:15:09:57]
CDR: Seriously, Jack, when I stop the spacecraft
     looking at - at the Earth, I'm going to have to
     roll - in [glossary:LM] terms, roll the spacecraft 90 degrees
     to get the tip of the Earth all on the
     Y-axis.

[03:15:10:45]
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim. You're going to have
     to roll 90 degrees to point your plus X-axis at
     the Sun and put the crescent - the points of
     the crescent on the Y-axis. The points of the
     crescent on the Y-axis with the [glossary:COAS] pointed at
     the center of the Earth will take care of your
     yaw and your pitch.

[03:15:11:16]
CDR: Roger.

[03:15:11:38]
CC:  Okay, Jim. After you get that orientation to
     come in a little more steeply, we perform an
     [glossary:AGS] body-axis aline which is at 400 plus 5 on
     the [glossary:DEDA]. If the [glossary:AGS] ball is up at this time,
     the [glossary:AGS] ball will go to 000. We can talk more
     about control modes later, but we'd recommend
     doing this, of course, in [glossary:AGS] ATTITUDE HOLD -
     ATTITUDE HOLD. Put your YAW to MODE CONTROL and
     leave PITCH and ROLL in PULSE, therefore, controlling
     your attitude with the [glossary:TTCA]. We don't
     want to use the gimbal, so have ENGINE GIMBAL
     OFF. We'll make these burns at 10-percent
     thrust. We'll use a manual start and stop. For
     ullage, we'll use the PLUS-X TRANSLATIONAL
     button, and ullage will be for 10 seconds. Over.

[03:15:13:06]
CDR: Okay. I understand what you're saying, but
     you'll have to repeat it here.

[03:15:13:15]
_page : 407
_tape : Tape 58/4
CC: Okay. We'll perform the burn in GUIDANCE CONTROL
     to [glossary:AGS]. And MODE CONTROL to ATTITUDE HOLD.
     Your ATTITUDE CONTROL switches will be ROLL to
     PULSE, PITCH to PULSE, and YAW to MODE CONTROL.
     So the [glossary:AGS] will control your yaw and you will
     use the [glossary:TTCA] to control pitch and roll. ENGINE
     GIMBAL OFF; 10-percent thrust. Start and stop
     manual. For ullage, use the plus-X translational
     button; 10 seconds ullage. Over.

[03:15:14:45]
CDR: Okay. For the burn there will be go to GUIDANCE
     CONTROL [glossary:AGS], MODE CONTROL ATT HOLD, ATTITUDE
     CONTROL switches will be ROLL PULSE, PITCH PULSE,
     YAW MODE CONTROL. We'll use [glossary:TTCA] control for
     pitch and roll. ENGINE GIMBAL will be OFF; we'll
     be using 10-percent thrust; we'll start and stop
     manually, the ... control ullage will be a PLUS-X
     TRANSLATIONAL button. And also our thrust will
     still be, but before that we are going to do an
     [glossary:AGS] aline ... ball ...

[03:15:15:26]
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim. After you get oriented
     in the attitude you want to burn in, do an [glossary:AGS]
     aline which is - an [glossary:AGS] body-axis aline which is
     400 plus 5. When you get ENTER, this will bring
     ball up to 000, and I want to confirm that you -
     that you said ENGINE GIMBAL OFF. O-F-F. Over.

[03:15:15:52]
CDR: Roger. Confirm that ENGINE GIMBAL will be off.

[03:15:16:11]
CDR: And, Jack, how long do you estimate the length
     of the burns will be?

[03:15:16:17]
CC:  Okay. The length of the burns are going to be
     probably less than a minute. And we want you
     to have cut-off based on time. So we will give
     you a burn time. And I have a [glossary:P30] maneuver pad
     for midcourse-7 in the event that we lose COMM
     if you are ready to copy.

[03:15:16:56]
CDR: Okay, Jack. Ready to copy.

[03:15:17:06]
CC:  Okay, Jim. [glossary:P30] [glossary:LM] maneuver pad: the purpose is
     midcourse-7. [glossary:NOUN 33] is [time:05:14:59:42|134:59:42.98]. [glossary:NOUN 81]
     is N/A. H<sub>A</sub> is N/A. H<sub>P</sub> is plus 0020.5. DELTA-V R
     is 0019.3. Burn time, 0:39; 008, 000; the rest
     is N/A; thrust will be at 10 percent. Read back.

[03:15:18:19]
_page : 408
_tape : Tape 58/5
CDR: All right. This is midcourse-7 corridor control,
     and it's in case we lose COMM: [time:05:14:59:42|134:59:42.98];
     [glossary:NOUN 81] is N/A; 42, N/A; plus 0020.5; 0019.3.
     Burn time, 0:39; 008, 000. All the rest is N/A:
     thrust 10 percent.

[03:15:19:04]
CC:  Okay, Jim. That's a good readback, and in the
     event of lost COMM, use the procedures that I
     gave you. It may be that between now and tomorrow
     these procedures will change a little bit,
     so we'll go with what we've got now, and stand
     by for something better if it comes. Over.

[03:15:19:28]
CDR: Okay, Jack. I'm looking at your burn pad and I
     see that the ... total gimbal ... 19.3 feet per
     second.

[03:15:19:44]
CC:  Okay, Jim. We verify 19.3 feet per second for
     39 seconds.

[03:15:20:51]
CDR: The old midcourse technique sounds like something
     that we came up with on Apollo 8.

[03:15:21:00]
CC:  Yes, everybody wondered if you would remember
     that; by golly, you did.

[03:15:21:17]
CC:  Hey, Jim, I got a little bit more information -
     maneuver pad, I got LAT/LONG range to go, VERB
     10 and [glossary:GET]; if you got a place to copy that down,

     minus 165.67; range to go, 11629; velocity
     36291; [time:05:22:41:30|142:41:30].

[03:15:23:24]
CC:  Okay, Jim. The latitude is minus 021.62; I have
     a correction on the longitude - minus 165.37.
     Go ahead.

[03:15:23:46]
CDR: Roger, Jack. The latitude is minus 21.62;
     longitude is minus 165.37, and this goes in
     conjunction with that midcourse 7 pad you gave
     us.

[03:15:24:02]
CC:  That's affirmative. That means no maneuvers
     between now and midcourse 7. And this is a
     horizontal in-plane burn, plus X, toward the
     Sun, 19.3 feet per second.

[03:15:24:52]
CDR: Roger. ...

[03:15:26:31]
CC:  And, Jim, on the - Setting up the [glossary:AGS], right
     after you do the 400 plus 5, you should do a
     400 plus all balls. And one other point we
     want to clarify is that we know that you're sure
     that this burn will be made with the plus X-axis
     pointing at the Sun to make the entry angle
     steeper. You got it?

[03:15:27:10]
CDR: That's right, Jack. What I'm going to do is -
     We'll stop with the Earth in the commander's
     window, the [glossary:COAS] down, and then I'm going to
     maneuver the spacecraft so that I have the
     lighted portion of the Earth at the top of the
     window; that is, the [glossary:COAS] will be along the
     plus-Y of the spacecraft and the top of the
     window - of the rendezvous window, I should be
     looking into the Sun. That means I'll be burning
     towards the Sun and steepening the angle.

[03:15:28:03]
CC:  That's affirm, Jim. I - You got the attitude
     right, and did you copy about doing a 400 plus
     all balls after - you do the 400 plus 5? That
     is, a 400 plus 5 and a 400 plus all zeros back
     to back.

[03:15:28:22]
_page : 410
_tape : Tape 59/2
CDR: Roger. I have copied that.

[03:15:30:15]
CDR: Jack - this is Aquarius. I'm not too sure how
     long or with what force the venting is going to
     do to our trajectory. However, you might keep
     a check on that. It may have been going on for
     some time.

[03:15:30:47]
CC:  Roger, Jim. We've been taking a look at it. We
     haven't been able to detect it on the Doppler,
     however.

[03:15:30:56]
CDR: Roger.

[03:15:31:08]
CC:  But we think it's pretty small.

[03:15:34:05]
CDR: And, Houston, Aquarius.

[03:15:34:09]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[03:15:34:14]
CDR: Jack, would you give me a time hack on an even
     [glossary:GET] so I can start my watch.

[03:15:34:24]
CC:  Okay. Coming up on 87 hours and 35 minutes, we
     will be there in 30 seconds. Set it for 87.35.

[03:15:34:37]
CDR: Just give me a hack at 88 hours.

[03:15:34:43]
CC:  Okay. I'll give you a hack at 88 hours. That'll
     be another 25 minutes.

[03:15:34:51]
_extra : END OF TAPE
CDR: All right. Thanks.

[03:15:41:53]
_page : 411
_tape : Tape 60/1
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[03:15:41:56]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[03:15:42:00]
CDR: Okay, Jack. Let's just talk over how I'm going
     to get to the attitude and then do the burn.
     What I'm talking about is the control techniques.
     The way it looks now I'll try to stop the spacecraft
     in yaw with the Earth out my window, then
     we'll be in GUIDANCE or we'll be [glossary:AGS] CONTROL;
     we'll be in - yaw will be in MODE CONTROL. Then
     we'll be using the [glossary:TTCA|TTCAs] to control the pitch and
     then control the roll. I don't see another way
     we can control the combination that we have here
     without using the [glossary:TTCA|TTCAs]. Then we will also use
     the [glossary:TTCA] during engine burn. Do you people concur with that technique?

[03:15:43:05]
CC:  Jim, that sounds like the one that is best to
     use to me. Let me talk it over with the rest of
     the guys here, and we'll advise you.

[03:15:43:16]
CDR: Okay.

[03:15:46:43]
CC:  Jim, in that control mode, that sounds like the
     best way to go. The only thing you'll have to
     do is to get ATTITUDE HOLD in the [glossary:AGS], and so
     before you start to maneuver, you'll have to
     bring the [glossary:AGS] up, and get a 400 plus all zeros
     in there, and then [glossary:AGS] will respond in yaw when
     you go to MODE CONTROL. That is, [glossary:AGS] will control
     your yaw in MODE CONTROL and your pitch and
     roll can be taken care of in PULSE with a [glossary:TTCA].
     After you get in attitude, then, you'll have to
     re-do an [glossary:AGS] body axis aline which is 400 plus
     5, then go back to 400 plus all zeros again.

[03:15:47:36]
CDR: Right, Jack. That was my next question. I don't
     want to aline the [glossary:AGS] ball 000 until I am in position,
     so we use that as a primary attitude burn
     monitor device.

[03:15:48:05]
CC:  And, Jim, you can do a 400 plus all zeros any
     time you want to; that just tells the [glossary:AGS] that
     you want it to control your attitude should you
     go to ATTITUDE HOLD in MODE CONTROL.

[03:15:48:19]
_page : 412
_tape : Tape 60/2
CDR: Roger. I understand, but after we get to the
     attitude, we'll do a 400 plus 5 to get the [glossary:AGS]
     aline ball, and then we'll do a 400 plus zero.

[03:15:48:31]
CC:  Affirmative.

[03:15:49:14]
CC:  Another thing, Jim, is while you're maneuvering
     to that attitude using [glossary:AGS] to control your yaw,
     if you find out enroute to that attitude that
     you didn't quite have the yaw where you wanted
     it to be, you can use your ACA and tweak up the
     yaw, and your [glossary:AGS] needles go right back to zero
     because you zero the attitude errors.

[03:15:49:46]
CDR: Roger. Sounds good.

[03:15:50:48]
CC:  Jim, you'll be splashing down about 560 miles
     southeast of Samoa at about 0800 local time.
     The weather forecast for the area is good; 1500,
     scattered, high broken, 10-mile visibility. The
     seas will be 5-foot waves, 15 knots, and you'll
     be going to Samoa by boat and/or aircraft. You'll
     spend either the night on the boat or in Samoa
     and return to Ellington by 141 on Saturday, the
     following day.

[03:15:51:37]
CDR: Roger. Would you tell the people of the LRL to
     turn it off.

[03:15:51:46]
CC:  Oh, no. We're going to do the whole bit.

[03:15:53:21]
CDR: And don't forget my hack at 88 hours, Jack.

[03:15:53:24]
CC:  Say again, please, Aquarius.

[03:15:53:30]
CDR: I want to get my time hack at 88 hours.

[03:15:53:53]
CC:  Roger. That will be in about 6-1/2 more minutes.

[03:15:54:42]
CDR: Roger.

[03:15:56:20]
CC:  Jim, we got a couple of news-type items. President
     Nixon has chosen a judge from Minnesota for
     the position of Associate Justice in the Supreme
     Court. A bill giving federal employees a
     6-percent pay raise passed the House and went to
     the President; includes the military. And the
     air traffic controllers returned to work.

[03:15:56:57]
_page : 413
_tape : Tape 60/3
CDR: Well, that's great. You think they'll consider this for flight pay?

[03:15:57:33]
CC: Well, we might be able to work out some arrangement.

[03:15:58:35]
CDR: Standing by for the 88-hour time hack.

[03:15:58:43]
CC:  Say again, Jim.

[03:15:58:47]
CDR: Standing by for the 88-hour time hack.

[03:15:58:52]
CC:  Okay. We got a minute to go.

[03:15:59:54]
CC:  Okay. Coming up on the 88-hour mark. I'll give
     you a 2-second delay. Stand by to mark.

[03:15:59:59]
CC:  MARK.

[03:16:00:05]
CDR: I got it.

[03:16:10:10]
CC:  How are you doing, Jim?

[03:16:10:16]
CDR: Pretty good, Jack. Say, you might have the people
     look at our [glossary:DPS] burn card to see what changes
     have to be made on it for the burn.

[03:16:10:30]
CC:  Heard you say look at the [glossary:DPS] burn; you'll have
     to say what about it again, please.

[03:16:10:39]
CDR: Roger, Jack. You might take a look at our [glossary:DPS]
     burn card, our checklist card that we have in the
     [glossary:LM], and see what changes might have to be put in
     that checklist.

[03:16:10:50]
CC:  Okay, [glossary:DPS] burn card.

[03:16:25:18]
CC:  How're you doing there, Jim?

[03:16:25:23]
CDR: Okay, Jack. It appears that we're going - funny
     diversion here, the [glossary:PTC] attitude in - in pitch.
     I'm going to do a [glossary:LPD] check now, but the last
     time the Moon went around, it was above - way
     away above the [glossary:LPD] angle and I see the Earth
     coming around now which is going to be pretty
     low. They oscillate back and forth, but each
     time they seem to get a little farther away from
     the center line. You might think of some procedure
     to reestablish [glossary:PTC], if it's necessary.

[03:16:26:02]
CC:  Okay.

[03:16:27:09]
_page : 414
_tape : Tape 60/1
CC:  Jim, the only way we know of getting the as good
     or a better [glossary:PTC] than you've got right now is to
     crank up the G & N and we - We don't want to do
     that. So our plan is to just take whatever we
     get out of this, and later on, it may turn out
     by the time you get to burn attitude, you'll be
     right where you want to be.

[03:16:27:37]
CDR: Okay. We'll just leave her go.

[03:16:30:36]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[03:16:30:38]
CC:  Go ahead.

[03:16:30:42]
CDR: What's our course of action to set up [glossary:PTC] after
     this midcourse at 107?

[03:16:30:51]
CC:  We thought you'd ask that.

[03:16:31:06]
CC:  The only thing we can try to do, Jim, is to get
     the thing up manually and see what happens.
     There must be a better answer than that - -

[03:16:31:17]
CDR: Okay.

[03:16:31:18]
CC:  - - and one course of action is to omit the midcourse
     and make a total midcourse, say, about
     8 hours before entry. We haven't decided yet.

[03:16:31:37]
CC:  Right now we're talking about a 7-foot-per-second
     midcourse at 104 hours. And extrapolate that
     down to about 8 hours before entry. We gave you
     a pad for that - that's about, only 19 feet per
     second, so if it doesn't change too much - and
     we can get all kinds of [glossary:DPS].

[03:16:32:01]
CDR: Understand. Sure like to keep this vehicle in
     the corridor though.

[03:16:55:07]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[03:16:55:10]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[03:16:55:16]
CDR: Can you think of any normal venting phenomena
     that might occur like maybe - a hydrogen tank
     that's over-pressurized relieving in the window?

[03:16:55:31]
CC:  Yes, we thought of that, Jim.

[03:16:55:52]
_page : 415
_tape : Tape 60/5
CC: That is one possibility that we've though of, Jim, because -
     We heated up that tank, and we haven't been using any hydrogen
     and, therefore, it could be venting in the overboard release.

[03:16:56:10]
CDR: Right. The only other thing I can think of when
     I look at it through the [glossary:AOT] is - it did appear
     to be coming from one spot; but that's the only
     difference although I can't see where it is coming
     from because it's beyond the curvature of
     the command module. But, it appears like it might
     be coming from more than this one spot.

[03:16:56:34]
CC:  Okay. Thank you. We hope that when we crank up
     the command module tomorrow that we'll be able
     to - or later on today - that we will be able to
     identify more closely what it's been coming from.
     But, the guidance guys say that they haven't been
     able to see the results of any venting in their
     data and it would take a very, very small amount
     to perturb their data.

[03:16:57:02]
CDR: Well, that's a note of encouragement.

[03:16:58:28]
SC:  (Music)

[03:16:58:57]
CC:  You got a Chinese band going up there?

[03:16:59:04]
CDR: Oh, sorry. I forgot all about hot mike.

[03:16:59:10]
CC:  Sounds pretty good.

[03:17:05:51]
CC:  Jim, we've had you scheduled for an eat period
     about an hour ago. I suppose you've taken care
     of that. The other thing is we're kind of interested
     in knowing how long you're going to be
     at stick there, or if you're going to go back to
     bed or what?

[03:17:06:12]
CDR: Okay, Jack. We're - We're going to set up a
     regular watch and sleep period here. Fred was
     up for a long time, so I got up a little bit
     early to relieve him. Jack and Fred are now
     asleep, so I'm going to let them sleep as long
     as they can, and then we'll have an eat period
     and then I'll go back to bed for a bit. And
     we'll separate the schedule.

[03:17:06:40]
_page : 416
_tape : Tape 60/6
CC:  Okay. We're right at the point now where,
     according to the flight plan that we had made
     up for you, that you would have all finished
     eating and you and Jack would have the duty
     while Fred went to sleep. So, essentially,
     according to the plan we've got, you got up about
     3 or 4 hours early. And - The next time that we
     have that as a rest period for you is at 96 hours,
     which is 7 hours from now, and an hour before
     that, say at 95 hours, all three of you would eat,
     and then you and Jack would hit the sack again
     and Fred would have the duty until 102 hours.
     We'd be glad to take care of this work-rest cycle
     for you.

[03:17:07:40]
CDR: Okay. That's good. Let me - Let me wait until
     they get up, or at least Jack gets up. He should
     be getting up before Fred. And we'll try to get
     back on the schedule. I hate to wake everybody
     up right now though, if they're sleeping.

[03:17:07:54]
CC:  Okay. Your choice on that. As soon as Jack gets
     up, I'd suggest we go ahead and break up these
     lithium hydroxide canisters and make a couple of
     them. Jack could work on that. It's going to
     take four sets of hands, I think.

[03:17:08:15]

     lithium hydroxide canister squared away.

     procedure for making these lithium hydroxide

CDR: I'll give Jack the headset and let him copy the instructions.

[03:18:08:43]
CC:  Okay, Jim. The way I thought it might be best
     to do it would be to have you gather the equipment
     and let us talk you through your procedure
     while you do it. Now, maybe you could give Jack
     the headset and - and - get the equipment together,
     and we'll talk you through the procedure.
     I think it'll be a little easier to do that way
     than if you tried to copy it all down - and then
     go do it.

[03:18:09:11]
CDR: Okay. Do you have any equipment listed? I'll
     just get it and give it to him and I can just sit
     here where I am.

[03:18:09:17]
CC:  Okay. I think the equipment you'll need will be
     two command module lithium hydroxide canisters,
     a roll of the gray tape, the two [glossary:LCG]s, because
     we're going to use the bags from the [glossary:LCG]s, and
     one - one [glossary:LM] cue card - one of those cardboard
     cue cards which you will cut off about an inch
     and a half out from the ring. Now, I think that's
     all we'll need. Over.

[03:18:10:03]
CDR: Okay. ... Okay, Houston.

[03:18:10:23]
CDR: Hello, Houston.

[03:18:10:25]
CC:  Go ahead, Jim.

[03:18:10:28]
CDR: Okay. That's two lithium hydroxide canisters,
     one roll of that special gray tape, two [glossary:LCG]s
     which we're going to use the bags from, one [glossary:LM]
     cue card and ...

[03:18:10:53]
CC:  Okay. That's affirmative, Jim. If you'll just
     cut the cue card, which is a handy piece of
     stiff paper the right size, about an inch and a
     half from the rings. Just cut off the ring
     holes, in other words, and you'll have a card
     about 11 inches long and probably 6 inches wide,
     something like that.

[03:18:11:19]
CDR: Okay, ... I'll have Jack gather up the stuff.

     you are out of your country, you get a 60-day
     extension.

[03:18:22:50]
CC:  Okay; right. Okay. I'm ready to start into
     the procedure. When you answer me back, speak
     up - speak up into the microphone, because our
     downlink is pretty noisy. The first thing we
     want you to do, and we'll do this on one canister,
     and then let you go ahead and repeat it on
     the second. So take one of the [glossary:LCG]s and cut off
     the outer bag. By cutting along one the heat
     seals; do it carefully and close to the heat
     seal, because we may have to use the outer bag
     if we damage the inner bag. So go ahead and
     do that, and then we'll do the next step.

[03:18:23:37]
CMP: Okay. Take an [glossary:LCG], cut the outer bag by the
     heat seal. Be careful not to damage the inner
     bag. Right?

[03:18:23:46]
_page : 420
_tape : Tape 61/4
CC: Right. Just cut along one side.

[03:18:24:50]
CMP: Hey, Houston, Odyssey - or Aquarius. We've done that.

[03:18:24:55]
CC:  Okay, Jack. Now - now remove the inner bag from
     the outer bag, and cut the inner bag, also,
     along one of the heat seals down one side.

[03:18:25:15]
CMP: Okay. Remove the inner bag from the outer bag,
     cut the inner bag along the heat seal along
     one side.

[03:18:25:22]
CC:  Okay. That's correct. Do that, and report.

[03:18:26:20]
CMP: Okay, Joe. We've got that done.

[03:18:26:22]
CC:  Okay, Jack. Now you can put the [glossary:LCG] itself;
     that is, take it out of the inner bag, put it
     in the outer bag, and stow it some place; we
     recommend U-1, but you can stow it wherever
     it's convenient.

[03:18:26:40]
CMP: ... outer bag ... I'd stow it back in ...

[03:18:26:48]
CMP: Okay, Joe. We've got that.

[03:18:26:50]
CC:  Okay. Now pick up one of the lithium hydroxide
     canisters, and let me describe which end is
     which. It's approximately square on one - one
     of the vented flat ends, has the strap, and
     that end we call the top, the end opposite we
     call the bottom. Is that clear? Over.

[03:18:27:21]
CMP: Right.

[03:18:27:34]
CMP: Okay. I've got it, Joe.

[03:18:27:37]
CC:  Okay. Now then, we're - we want you to take the
     tape and cut out two pieces about 3 feet long, or
     a good arm's length, and what you're - what we want
     you to do with them is to make two belts around
     the sides of the canister, one belt near the top
     and one belt near the bottom, with the sticky
     side out; wrap it around, sticky side out, as
     tight as possible. It'll probably take both of
     you to get it nice and snug. Over.

[03:18:30:01]
CMP: Okay, now -

[03:18:30:15]
CMP: Okay. Now we've got to make the belt real taut
     here.

[03:18:30:23]
_page : 421
_tape : Tape 61/5
CDR: How's that?

[03:18:30:35]
CMP: Real tight. And then ...

[03:18:33:13]
CMP: Okay, Joe.

[03:18:33:18]
CC:  Okay, Jack. Did you have - -

[03:18:33:19]
SC:  - - Hey, Houston, are you reading?

[03:18:33:24]
CC:  Jack - -

[03:18:33:25]
CMP: - - We've got the two belts around the top and
     the one around the bottom all done.

[03:18:33:30]
CC:  Okay, fine. The next step now is to anchor that
     tape, and the way we want you to do that is to
     cut about a 2-foot length off the roll and then
     tear it lengthwise so that you have two strips
     about 2 feet long and about a half an inch wide.
     And you'll wrap those around the canister at right
     angles, more or less, to the tape that you've got
     so that it goes across the top and across the
     bottom; and when it goes across the top and the
     bottom, put it so that it's outboard of the
     center hole and try to get it over one of the
     ridges between the screens, so that it won't
     block the flow. Is that clear? Over.

[03:18:34:15]
CMP: Yes, Joe. Very good.

[03:18:34:17]
CC:  Okay. Press on.

[03:18:34:22]
CMP: Okay. I've got a cut length right here and we'll
     tear it lengthwise ... and I'm going to go around
     right here at this ridge all the way around at
     right angles and anchor it ...

[03:18:34:43]
CMP: Yes.

[03:18:34:46]
CMP: Joe, just to clarify that, sticky end down.
     Right? On the tape that I am putting on now?

[03:18:34:54]
CC:  I didn't quite copy that, Jack. Say again.

[03:18:34:58]
CMP: Okay. That will be the sticky end down on
     the container, right?

[03:18:35:05]
CC:  Oh, that's correct. I forgot to say that.
     That's right.

[03:18:35:33]
_page : 422
_tape : Tape 61/6
CMP: ... hold that one right here, if I can set it.

[03:18:37:28]
CMP: Okay, Joe; Aquarius. We've got that done.

[03:18:37:32]
CC:  Okay, Jack. The next step is to get the [glossary:EVA] cue
     card and use it to form an arch over the top of
     the canister; just tuck one short end under one
     ridge on the top the other one against the ridge
     on the other side so that it forms a rounded
     arch over the top of the canister. You see,
     Jack, what we're going to do is slip the bag
     over this whole assembly and the cue card will
     serve to keep the bag from being sucked down
     against the screen. Over.

[03:18:38:10]
CMP: Okay. I got the idea.

[03:18:38:13]
CC:  Okay. And when you've done that, to hold the
     arch in place, just run a strip of tape across
     the side of the - that is, across the top of the
     arch, and anchor it down to the sticky strips
     along each side.

[03:18:38:31]
CMP: Okay. I got the idea. Okay. Let me just repeat
     it here. Take a cue card, form an arch over the
     top, bringing it under the side here. When we're
     through, run a piece of tape from the sides across
     the top of that to anchor to the other side.

[03:18:38:51]
CC:  That's correct.

[03:18:38:56]
CMP: Okay. It worked.

[03:18:39:00]
CMP: The top. ... Across the top.

[03:18:39:18]
CMP: Looks like you're going to have to cut the cue
     card slightly.

[03:18:39:32]
CMP: Doesn't have to be really ... over that the only
     thing we're ... we can just take the scissors and
     cut off the edge here. The only thing this does,
     Jim, is prevent this from being sucked down into
     the container.

[03:18:40:28]
CMP: Still going to need some more tape. Cut off the
     end. Okay. Whack off the bottom. ...

[03:18:43:34]
CMP: Okay, Joe. We've got that arch built, and it's
     all taped in securely.

[03:18:43:41]
_page : 423
_tape : Tape 61/7
CC: Okay, Jack. The next step is to stop up the
     bypass hole, which is the hole in the center of
     the bottom of the canister; we want to stop that
     up because we don't want to bypass the flow; and
     I forgot to tell you to get something to stick
     in that hole. We recommend that you either use
     a wetwipe, or cut off a piece of sock and stuff
     it in there, or you could probably even crumble
     up some tape and use that. Over.

[03:18:44:13]
CMP: Okay. We'll start plugging up the bypass hole.

[03:18:44:17]
CC: Okay.

[03:18:44:18]
CMP: Plug that hole. We can either - we can put some
     either - Let's cut a piece of your towel there.

[03:18:44:27]
_extra : END OF TAPE
CC: Sounds good.

[03:18:47:14]
_page : 424
_tape : Tape 62/1
CMP: Okay, Houston; Aquarius. We have the bypass hole
     all plugged up.

[03:18:47:21]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. The next step is take the inner
     [glossary:LCG] bag that you cut open, and slip it over the
     top of the canister, when you do that, orient it
     so that the ears of the bag, that is, the corners
     should stick out on the closed end - are oriented
     along the open ends of the arch, because we're
     going to snip one of those corners to stick the
     hose in. Pull it down until it fits snugly over
     the arch. Over.

[03:18:47:56]
CMP: Okay, Joe. Slip the bag over the canister so that
     the arch is at the bottom of the bag and that the
     ears are along oriented along, let's see - I guess
     it would be - would be at the sides of the arch.

[03:18:48:19]
CC:  Depends on what you mean by sides - over the - the
     open ends of the arch.

[03:18:48:26]
CMP: Right, the open ends of the arch.

[03:18:48:28]
CC:  Okay.

[03:18:49:17]
CMP: Okay, Joe. We've got that done.

[03:18:49:20]
CC:  Okay. Now press the bag against the sticky belts
     that we put on the sides of the canister. If
     there is any excess material, just kind of pleat
     it, so that it makes a fairly tight seal, and then
     take another 3-foot strip of sticky tape and wrap
     it around the outside of the bag opposite the
     bottom - the bottom sticky belt - to make a nice
     tight seal.

[03:18:49:50]
CMP: Okay. I'll do it. Okay. Now they want two
     strips around here to make a tight seal.

[03:18:52:38]
CMP: Okay, Joe. We've got the canister inside the bag,
     two strips around the sides of the bag, real
     tight, and both sealed.

[03:18:52:47]
CC:  Okay; real fine. Now there's probably a couple
     of inches of excess bag sticking our around the
     bottom of the canister. To prevent this from
     sucking in against the bottom screen, we'd like
     you to trim it off with the scissors, and when
     you've done that, we'd like you to cut two more
     strips of tape about 12 inches long or so, cut
     the - tear them lengthwise to get four pieces
     12 inches long and 1/2-inch wide, and then use
     those four strips to secure the bag by passing
     the strips from the sides of the canister outside
     the bag around the bottom of the canister and
     back up the other side, and when you do this,
     just as you did on the top, make them go outboard
     of the hole and in between the screens. Over.

[03:18:53:42]
_page : 425
_tape : Tape 62/2
CMP: Okay. You want me to trim the excess material
     that's sticking off here; trim it at the edge of
     that canister? Or do you want any excess left
     over?

[03:18:53:52]
CC:  No, you don't need to have any excess. Just trim
     it approximately level.

[03:18:53:59]
CMP: Okay. Let's do that first.

[03:18:54:01]
CC:  Okay.

[03:18:54:58]
CMP: Okay. Now, Joe, you want to cut four strips,
     12 inches long each, 1/2-inch in diameter. Tape
     that along the outsides of the bag across the
     ribs.

[03:18:55:15]
CC:  That's correct, Jack. That's just for additional
     security on the bag. When you get those done,
     you'll have - You'll have two strips going one
     way, and the other two will be perpendicular to
     them.

[03:18:57:58]
CMP: Okay, Houston; Aquarius. We've got the four
     strips in place.

[03:18:58:08]
CC:  Okay. We're in business now with the bag, and
     the next step to perform is to get ready to put
     the red suit hose, either the commander's or the
     LMP's because we're - we're going to want you to
     have both of these made up eventually, into the
     top of the - of the bag, and to do that you,
     first of all, have to assure that the - that the
     red hose is separated from the blue hose. I
     don't know whether this has been done already,
     but if it hasn't, what you have to do is cut the
     outer Beta-cloth sheath down the full length of
     the - of the hoses and then also cut the rubber
     ties that secure the two hoses together, and the
     hoses should come apart and the COMM cable
     should - should come off. Over.

[03:18:59:04]
_page : 426
_tape : Tape 62/3
CMP: Okay. Take the  - I'm going to want to separate
     the red hose from the blue hose by cutting this Beta-cloth sheath.
     Okay. That's in work.

[03:18:59:15]
CC:  Okay.

[03:19:00:52]
CMP: Okay, Houston; Aquarius. I have the LMP's red
     hose separated from the others.

[03:19:01:00]
CC:  Okay. Real fine. Now the next step is to cut
     a diagonal hole in one ear of the - of the plastic
     bag near the arch. You can pick either one and
     cut about, a 1-1/2 or 2 inch diagonal hole, big
     enough to slip the red hose through. And when
     you've done that, you'll just slip the red hose
     through so that it goes about to the center of
     the canister. It's - it's - It's not critical
     except that the opening should be down, and then
     tape the bag to the hose where it goes in so that
     it's nice and snug. Over.

[03:19:01:40]
CMP: Okay. Copy that. We want a 1-1/2 inch hole
     right here at this ear, and put the hose in here,
     end down and toward the canister and then we
     tape the seal around here.

[03:19:02:10]
CMP: Let's try it. We can always make it bigger if
     we have to. Fred, get those. ... the center of
     the arch.

[03:19:02:52]
CMP: Got to - Got to come in towards the center, all
     the way to the center. No, no.

[03:19:06:17]
CMP: Yes. I can't get those big knobs.

[03:19:08:39]
CMP: ... All we have to do is ... tape around here
     ... tight fit. ...

[03:19:10:16]
CDR: There it is right there.

[03:19:10:18]
CMP: Okay, Houston; Aquarius.

[03:19:10:20]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.

[03:19:10:26]
CMP: Okay. Our do-it-yourself lithium hydroxide
     canister change is complete. Joe, the only thing
     different is that our arch on this piece of cardboard
     is not big enough to position the red hose
     with the inlet down, and the inlet - the inlet
     to - to the red hose is lying on its side, but
     I think it'll still work.

[03:19:10:53]
_page : 427
_tape : Tape 62/4
CC:  Okay, Jack. I concur. I think it'll work, too.
     There's one step that I omitted, which you can
     do now quite conveniently, and it's this. Where
     you stuff the towel in the bypass hole on the
     bottom, we recommend that you cut a few short
     pieces of tape and just tape that over so it
     doesn't fall out. Over.

[03:19:11:17]
CMP: Okay. Will do. Jim, I've got one more little
     thing to do, and that's ... seal that top.

[03:19:12:28]
CMP: Okay, Joe. That's done.

[03:19:12:30]
CC:  Okay, Jack. Now the remaining steps are simply
     suit-loop configuration steps to get this thing
     into full operation, and our [glossary:ECS] people want to
     hold off on that until the canister you're working 
     on gets to 7.6 millimeters of mercury, which
     will probably be another 45 minutes or an hour -
     it - We're reading 4.7 now. So what we'd like
     you to do in the interim is to set up the second
     command module canister the same way you just did
     the first one, using the commander's hose, and
     get that all set and probably about that time
     it'll be time to - to switch over. For your information, 
     when you've got that done and if you've
     had your breakfast and so on, the next thing
     I've got for you is a switch-configuration list
     for the command module, which will represent the -
     the powerdown, square-1 starting configuration
     for all our - our preentry checks. Over.

[03:19:13:39]
CMP: Okay. We'll start setting up the commander's
     hose configuration the same as the LMP's hose.
     And I'll get - instead of - I guess you want me
     to use my launch ... - launch checklist which
     I'd ...

[03:19:14:00]
CC:  That's affirmative, Jack. What we have done is
     marked up the lift-off configuration checklist,
     and we'll run through it whenever you get around
     to it.

[03:19:14:11]
CMP: And, I assume that ...

[03:19:14:38]
CMP: What I'd better do is before I put this thing back
     in operation, they're going to complete that
     other canister. I don't know. It should be in
     operation now. ...

[03:19:15:05]
_page : 428
_tape : Tape 62/5
CMP: Okay, Houston; Aquarius.

[03:19:15:07]
CC: Aquarius, Houston. Go.

[03:19:15:12]
CMP: Okay, Joe. Should this canister be in operation
     now because it's already mounted on the hose?

[03:19:15:17]
CC: Well, yes. We haven't completely configured the
     suit loop to get full flow through there, and
     it's okay the way it is. What I recommend you
     do with the commander's hose is get the bag all
     ready, but not stick the hose in until we call
     you on it. Okay.

[03:19:15:39]
CMP: Okay. Will do.

[03:19:16:45]
CMP: It won't go around?

[03:19:17:04]
CMP: Yes. Or else a strip of tape.

[03:19:17:55]
CMP: Okay, Jim. We've got to start setting up the
     commander's. ...

     cutting the ... bag.

[03:19:20:33]
CMP: Yes. ... show. How about that ... because I've
     got two in my ...

[03:19:20:52]
CMP: Yes. Here, we'll store them back where I got it.

[03:19:21:06]
CC:  Hello, Aquarius; Houston.

[03:19:21:10]
CMP: Go ahead.

[03:19:21:11]
CC:  Roger, Jack; Tom here. Just thought I would pass
     on to you and Jim that got a little data priority
     going today, and going to convene to [glossary:CPCB] and
     we'll have you all kinds of good procedures for
     later on. Over.

[03:19:21:24]
CMP: Okay. Thank you, Tom. You guys are really working overtime.

[03:19:21:29]
CC: We're getting a little coordination down here.

[03:19:21:41]
CC: Aquarius, Houston. You might pass on to Jim, he
     had such a long day yesterday, we thought we were
     going to have to play him some guitar music to
     get him to sleep last night. Over.

     such a long day yesterday, he thought he was
     going to have to play some guitar music to get
     you to sleep.

[03:19:22:13]

[03:19:25:47]
CMP: Kind of looks like the Earth has gotten kind of
     angled a little bit, but it's, for as many hours
     as ..., I think it's been great. You know how
     to do this? How? ... the terminator.

[03:19:33:55]

[03:19:36:52]
CMP: Tom said the [glossary:CPCB] is getting ...

[03:19:37:01]

     activation.

[03:19:39:30]
CMP: ... Well, I don't really - Part of that is -
     See, Jim, I have the same problem that you
     have. I can't control pitch very well with my
     RHC - I have to use the THC and that was the
     control problem. No, I don't think that there's
     any control problem. I don't know why, because -
     Well, you have to ... ... you still have barber
     pole on the - on the ...

[03:19:43:16]

     it. ...

     cable there. And that will keep, then,
     until we're ready for them.

[03:19:45:53]
LMP: ... there's an orange in yours.

[03:19:46:06]

     we're going to go over initial switch configuration. 
     And get all those ...

     module switch configuration. That's on page L 1-1.

[03:19:53:24]

     switch configuration checklist. And I have in
     front of me the lift-off configuration,
     page L 1-1. Are you with me? Over.

[03:19:53:39]

     at a time, some of them are the same, some of
     them are changed, and you can read them back
     every few steps. [glossary:EMS] FUNCTION to OFF; [glossary:EMS] MODE
     to STANDBY, no change; GTA, off, down, no change;
     and GTA cover, secure, no change. Over.

CC:  - - COMM sounds better now, Jack - -

[03:20:23:30]
CMP: Okay, we're back. We - -

[03:20:23:32]
CC:  Good. SUIT POWER was OFF, and then go to
     panel 10, POWER, OFF, and SUIT POWER, OFF. Over.

[03:20:23:42]
CMP: Okay. I got it.

[03:20:23:44]
CC:  Okay. And that's the only changes on pages 1-8.
     Over.

[03:20:23:51]
CMP: Okay. SUIT POWER, OFF; panel 10, POWER and
     SUIT POWER, OFF.

[03:20:23:57]
CC:  That's correct. Go to page 1-9 and on panel 100,
     skip the first four. We want [glossary:IMU] POWER, OFF.
     Over.

[03:20:24:11]
CMP: Okay.

[03:20:24:12]
CC:  Okay. Skip the next one, and we want NUMERICS
     LIGHTING, OFF; FLOOD LIGHTS, OFF; and INTEGRAL
     LIGHTS, OFF. Over.

[03:20:24:25]
CMP: All right.

[03:20:24:26]
CC:  Okay. On panel 101, skip the first three. We
     want URINE DUMP to OFF, and WASTE WATER DUMP to
     OFF. Over.

[03:20:24:39]

_page : 441
_tape : Tape 63/3
CMP: Okay. Got it.

[03:20:25:14]
CC: Okay. On panel 225. It will read the same
     except I have three additional circuit breakers
     that we want open, and I'll read them up one at
     a time. The first one is S-BAND FM TRANSMITTER
     [glossary:DSE], GROUP 1, open. Over.

[03:20:25:46]
CMP: S-BAND TRANSMITTER [glossary:DSE], GROUP 1, open.

[03:20:25:51]
CC:  Roger that. The next one is FLIGHT BUS, MAIN A
     and MAIN B, and that's two breakers, both open.

[03:20:26:06]
CMP: FLIGHT BUS, MAIN A, and FLIGHT BUS, MAIN B,
     two of them, open.

[03:20:26:13]
CC:  Okay. That's correct. The last change is CTE,

     OFF, WASTE H<sub>2</sub>O to OFF. Panel 122, CONDITION
     LAMPS, OFF. Panel 201, FOOD WARMER, OFF.
     Panel 225, add additions that I read: S-BAND
     TRANSMITTER [glossary:DSE], GROUP 1; FLIGHT BUS, MAIN A
     and MAIN B, CET, two to open.

[03:20:27:27]
CC:  Okay. That's correct, Jack. Let's go to
     page 1-10. And on panel 226 - -

[03:20:27:33]
CMP: All right. We are going to switch on these.
     Got a switch on the ...

[03:20:27:39]
CC:  Okay.

[03:20:27:51]
CMP: Okay. How you reading?

[03:20:27:53]
CC:  Okay. Satisfactory, Jack. You ready for
     panel 226?

[03:20:27:58]
_page : 442
_tape : Tape 63/4
CMP: Let's go.

[03:20:28:00]
CC:  Okay. On panel 226, we want all open except;
     so change word "Closed" to "Open" and then
     scratch out the next three lines because we want
     them open, too. Over.

[03:20:28:18]
CMP: Okay. All open except and you're going to give
     the ones you want open.

[03:20:28:24]
CC:  Right. I'll give you the opens now. We want
     LIGHTING: FLOOD, MAIN A, MAIN B, and FLIGHT/POSTLANDING,
     closed.

[03:20:28:51]
CMP: Okay. LIGHTING: FLOOD, MAIN A; LIGHTING:
     FLOOD, MAIN B, closed; and FLIGHT/POSTLANDING,
     closed.

[03:20:28:59]
CC:  Roger, Jack. [glossary:EECOM] tells me that's all one
     circuit breaker, and the next one is LIGHTING:
     NUMERICS/INTEGRAL, [glossary:LEB] AC2, LMDC-AC1, and
     RMDC-AC1 to closed, and that's one circuit
     breaker also.

[03:20:29:26]
CMP: Okay. I don't know whether I can read that all
     back. Okay, LIGHTING: NUMERIC/INTEGRAL and
     I didn't get the rest of it, Joe -

[03:20:29:40]
CC:  Okay. Stand by 1 second while I make damn sure
     about this.

[03:20:30:59]
CC:  Jack, Houston. Over.

[03:20:31:02]
CMP: Go ahead.

[03:20:31:04]
CC:  Okay. On the 226 circuit breakers that I read
     up, they are - there are six circuit breakers
     involved and they're all - they're the first
     six from the left on the bottom row of the panel.
     They're under LIGHTING. We want the three FLOOD
     circuit breakers out and the three NUMERIC/INTEGRAL
     circuit breakers - I don't mean out, I
     mean closed. Those six closed and the rest open.
     Over.

[03:20:31:39]
CMP: Okay. There are three FLOOD circuit breakers
     and three NUMERIC circuit breakers and you want
     all six of those closed.

[03:20:31:49]
_page : 443
_tape : Tape 63/5
CC:  That's affirmative, Jack, and all the rest open.
     Okay. Panel 227, no change, and panel 229, one
     addition to the circuit breakers we want open,
     and those are the TIMERS, MAIN A and MAIN B,
     two, to open. Over.

[03:20:32:17]
CMP: Okay. Okay, you want the TIMING circuit breakers,
     two of them, open.

[03:20:32:24]
CC:  That's affirmative. Okay. On panel 250 - -

[03:20:32:27]
CMP: - - panel 229.

[03:20:32:29]
CC:  - - we want all closed except, and then scratch
     out all the ones that are there.

[03:20:32:40]
CMP: Okay. All closed except. Okay. I'm ready to
     copy.

[03:20:32:50]
CC:  Wait 1 minute. Yes, [glossary:EECOM] caught me; I said
     that wrong. We want you to change the word
     "Closed" to "Open," and then scratch out the
     ones that are there.

[03:20:33:03]
CMP: Okay. All open ...

[03:20:33:10]
CC:  Okay. The two that we want closed are SEQUENCER
     A and SEQUENCER B. Over.

[03:20:33:37]
CMP: Okay, Panel 250.

[03:20:33:42]
CC:  Say again, Jack. COMM is just improving.

[03:20:33:48]
CMP: Okay. I had to switch OMNIs here. And the two
     you want all open on panel 250 except SEQUENCE
     A and SEQUENCE B.

[03:20:33:59]
CC:  That's correct. Panel 251, no change; panel 252,
     WASTE STOWAGE VENT valve, closed. Over.

[03:20:34:12]
CMP: WASTE STOWAGE VENT valve, closed.

[03:20:34:15]
CC:  Roger. And, on panel 275, we want all the
     circuit breakers open; no exceptions. Over.

[03:20:34:26]
CMP: Panel 275, all open; no exceptions.

[03:20:34:30]
CC:  Okay, and that's all for page 1-10. You want
     to read any of that back? I think you've got
     it all.

[03:20:34:39]
_page : 444
_tape : Tape 63/6
CMP: No, I think I've got it all.

[03:20:34:41]
CC:  Okay. Let's go to page 1-11. On panel 276, no
     change; on panel 278, we want all circuit
     breakers open; no exceptions. Over.

[03:20:34:57]
CMP: Panel 278, all open.

[03:20:35:00]
CC:  Roger. Now we'll skip all the way down to
     panel 306 where we want the MISSION TIMER to
     STOP and the EVENT TIMER to STOP. Over.

[03:20:35:23]
CMP: Okay. Panel 306, MISSION TIMER, STOP; and EVENT
     TIMER, STOP.

[03:20:35:28]
CC:  Okay. And those are all the changes on 1-11,
     Jack.

[03:20:35:35]
CMP: Okay. Ready for 1-12.

[03:20:35:37]
CC:  Okay. On page 1-12, panel 325, we want both
     CABIN PRESSURE RELIEF valves to NORMAL. Over.

[03:20:35:49]
CMP: Okay. Both to NORMAL.

[03:20:35:52]
CC:  Okay. On panel 326, we want the REPRESS PACKAGE
     valves to OFF; the [glossary:SM] O<sub>2</sub> SUPPLY valves to OFF;
     the SURGE TANK O<sub>2</sub> valve to OFF. Over.

[03:20:36:10]
CMP: Okay. REPRESS, SERVICE MODULE O<sub>2</sub> SUPPLY, SURGE
     TANK O<sub>2</sub>, three of them, to OFF.

[03:20:36:19]
CC:  Roger. You did include the REPRESS PACKAGE
     there. Okay, GLYCOL RESERVOIR IN valve to
     CLOSED. BYPASS to OPEN, and OUT valve to CLOSED.
     Over.

[03:20:36:37]
CMP: Okay. GLYCOL RESERVOIR IN valve CLOSED; BYPASS
     valve OPEN; and RESERVOIR OUT valve CLOSED.

[03:20:36:51]
CC:  That's affirmative. Panel 350, no change.
     Panel 351, MAIN REGULATOR valves, two, to CLOSED,
     and the H<sub>2</sub>O/GLYCOL TANK PRESSURE REGULATOR valve,
     OFF, and RELIEF valve, OFF. Over.

[03:20:37:17]
CMP: Okay. MAIN REG valve, two, to CLOSED. WATER/GLYCOL
     TANK PRESSURE REG and RELIEF valves, both
     OFF.

[03:20:37:27]
_page : 445
_tape : Tape 63/7
CC:  Okay. That's affirm. Those to the left,
     changes on 1-12. Let's go to 1-13.

[03:20:37:35]
CMP: Okay. Ready to copy.

[03:20:37:37]
CC:  Okay. Go down to panel 380, O<sub>2</sub> DEMAND REG valve,
     OFF, and SUIT CIRCUIT RETURN VALVE, pulled to
     OPEN. Over.

[03:20:37:56]
CMP: Okay, both O<sub>2</sub> DEMAND REG valves are OFF and SUIT
     CIRCUIT RETURN VALVE pulled OPEN.

[03:20:38:05]
CC:  That's correct. Go to panel 382. The first one,
     two, three, four are unchanged. We want SEC
     EVAP H<sub>2</sub>O CONTROL valve OFF, and PRIM EVAP H<sub>2</sub>O
     CONTROL valve to OFF. Those both are both
     counterclockwise. Over.

[03:20:38:35]
CMP: Okay, Houston. Reading back 382, SECONDARY
     EVAPORATOR H<sub>2</sub>O CONTROL valve's OFF, and PRIMARY
     EVAPORATOR H<sub>2</sub>O CONTROL valve, OFF.

[03:20:38:49]
CC:  That's correct. Those are the only changes on
     1-13, and there are no changes on 1-14, and
     you've got it all, Jack. Over.

[03:20:39:01]
CMP: Okay. Real good, Joe. ... configures for that
     panel.

[03:20:39:08]
CC:  Okay. You can get those configures when you
     can. And the next order of business I've got
     for you is a procedure to verify that MAIN BUS
     B is good. And a little after that, we'll want
     to read up to you, for your future information,
     a procedure for transferring [glossary:LM] power to the
     command module. Over.

[03:20:39:33]
CMP: Okay. That sounds good. You want to get this
     [glossary:PLSS] configuration done first before you give
     those other procedures, huh?

[03:20:39:44]
CC:  Yes, I think so. Stand by 1 second and I'll
     see if FLIGHT has any words for us before you
     start that.

[03:20:40:22]
CC: Jack, Houston. Over.

[03:20:40:26]
CMP: Go ahead.

[03:20:40:27]
_page : 446
_tape : Tape 63/8
CC: Okay, we don't have anything for you. Our only
     concern is that you'll wake up somebody; is
     there anybody sleeping right now?

[03:20:40:37]
CMP: No. We're all sitting here eating. I'm just
     going to get a bite to eat. Then I'll write
     down that switch configuration, or I'll copy
     the procedure now, if you want.

[03:20:40:48]
CC:  Yes, okay. Understand they are all up. Did
     you say you wanted to copy the other procedure
     now? Over.

[03:20:40:57]
CMP: I can if you want. It's your choice.

[03:20:41:00]
CC: I'd rather you went ahead with the switch configuration, Jack.

[03:20:41:06]
CMP: Okay, let's do that and then I'll be back with
     you.

[03:20:41:10]
CC:  Okay. See you later. And tell Jim that Deke
     wants him to go to bed.

[03:20:41:21]
CMP: Okay. I'll tell him that right now.

[03:20:41:24]
CC:  Okay.

[03:20:41:25]
CMP: I'll tell you, I'll get my switch set done first
     before I eat so I won't disturb Jim any.

[03:20:41:31]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[03:20:41:36]
CMP: Go ahead.

[03:20:41:37]
CC:  Stand by 1 minute, Jack, before you go in there.
     FLIGHT has got one other item for you.

[03:20:41:48]
CMP: Deke wants you to go to bed.

[03:20:42:17]
CMP: Right now.

[03:20:42:30]
CMP: ... like that ... I got up about 1 hour ...

[03:20:43:31]
CMP: You know what I thought - I think what we saw
     venting was the result of our DELTA-Vs stirring
     up things, popping the relief valve. Yes. We
     don't see anything venting now. ...

[03:20:44:03]
CMP: Okay, Houston. We are standing by.

[03:20:44:12]
_page : 447
_tape : Tape 63/9
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[03:20:44:16]
CMP: Okay, Joe.

[03:20:44:18]
CC: Okay, Jack. You can go ahead and set up that
     switch configuration. What we are discussing
     is having you activate the MAIN BUS TIE motor
     switches a little later on simply to verify that
     they will be okay, because the batteries are
     probably getting a little bit cool. But we'll
     be back to you with a procedure and discussion
     about that after you get the switch configuration 
     set up. Over.

[03:20:44:47]
CMP: Okay, I'm going to go get the switch configuration 
     done now before Jim goes to bed so I don't
     disturb him.

[03:20:44:55]
CC:  Okay. Real fine.

[03:20:45:00]
CMP: Jim thinks Deke sounds like Frank Borman on
     Apollo 8.

[03:20:45:04]
CC:  (Laughter) Okay. Sorry about that.

[03:20:45:11]
CMP: I'm going to give the COMM to Fred-o, now.

[03:20:45:59]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[03:20:46:02]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.

[03:20:46:07]
CDR: Okay, before I hit the sack, Joe, I just want
     to make sure - How are you still planning an
     [glossary:MCC] at 107 and what's the latest find?

[03:20:46:16]
CC:  Okay, Jim. We are still gathering our thoughts
     on the [glossary:MCC], but some of the considerations go
     like this: [glossary:FIDO] tells us that we can do that
     correction probably as late as 118 hours, with
     no significant DELTA-V penalty, and with plenty
     of tracking thereafter to make sure that we've
     done the right thing, and to set you up for a
     late [glossary:MCC] if we need it, which we probably
     wouldn't. We are happy with the [glossary:PTC] mode that
     you are in now, and, although we are working
     up a - an [glossary:AGS] [glossary:PTC] mode to use after the midcourse correction, we'd kind of like you to
     stay in this [glossary:PTC] for a while because it is
     doing good. We are looking at the weather in
     the landing area. We don't think we'll have
     a problem but we are checking it real close,
     and if there is any changing that we want to do,
     we want to get it into this midcourse correction.
     And for reasons like that, we are considering
     possibly delaying the midcourse correction from
     104 hours to some time between there and 118.
     We'd like to know what you think about it. Over.

[03:20:47:33]
_page : 448
_tape : Tape 63/10
CDR: We have no druthers. As long as we do the midcourse and there is plenty of tracking thereafter
     to correct for another midcourse; that's my only
     concern.

[03:20:47:44]
CC:  Okay, Jim. Roger that. And based on [glossary:FIDO]'s
     input that he'd like to do it not later than
     24 hours before [glossary:EI], we will be doing it prior
     to 118 hours.

[03:20:47:57]
CDR: Okay.

[03:20:48:38]
LMP: Hello, Houston; Aquarius.

[03:20:48:43]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Go.

[03:20:48:48]
LMP: Question, Joe. Jim has been talking to me about
     how we are going to do this midcourse, and awhile
     back when we went through this power up, we had
     pulled the STAB/CONTROL ASA breaker. I was
     wondering - we lost the heaters in the ASA - I
     was wondering how it looked? What kind of shape
     it's going to be in?

[03:20:49:18]
CC: Okay. Stand by on that one, Fred.

[03:20:49:24]
LMP: Okay.

[03:20:49:48]
CC:  Fred, Houston.

[03:20:49:52]
LMP: Go ahead.

[03:20:49:53]
CC:  Roger. I am told that we'd see 38 degrees for
     that package, and it'll be okay for the burn.
     We're massaging the detail procedures for this
     burn at this time and we expect to have a real
     clean setup to you in plenty of time.

[03:20:50:12]
LMP: Okay, very good.

[03:20:50:30]
LMP: And I don't know if Jack passed it on to you,
     but Jack and I just finished logging about
     6 hours sleep, each.

[03:20:50:51]
_page : 449
_tape : Tape 63/11
CC: Roger, Fred. Copy that. Is it a little chilly
     up there?

[03:20:50:58]
LMP: Yes. We made the mistake of putting up the
     window shades, which we won't do again; and with
     this powered-down mode, we're not generating
     much internally, and it really did get chilly.

[03:20:51:13]
CC:  Yes. I guess you'll have to generate your own
     heat in there for a while.

[03:20:51:19]
CC:  Deke says unstow the Exer-Genie.

[03:20:51:26]
LMP: Okay.

[03:20:57:47]
CC: Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[03:20:57:52]
LMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[03:20:57:54]
CC: Fred, just wanted to let you know in advance
     that we're coming up on the redline CO<sub>2</sub> value
     for the secondary canister, and we expect to
     get there in something like a half hour, at
     which time we'll be asking you to switch over to
     the command module canisters. I have the rest
     of that procedure ready and I just wanted to
     warn you a little bit in advance. Over.

[03:20:58:20]
LMP: Okay. And I've got a question for you, Joe.

[03:20:58:25]
CC:  Go ahead.

[03:20:58:31]
LMP: Okay. The - I need to find out if the condensate
     container that we were going to use to strain
     some water in on the lunar surface - is that container 
     also completely airtight? Okay to use it
     to put fluid in through here in zero g?

[03:20:59:01]
CC:  Fred, I didn't copy what you wanted to use it
     for. Over.

[03:20:59:09]
LMP: ...

[03:20:59:21]
CC:  Fred, Houston. We'll have to stand by for
     1 minute. We are in a noisy state of COMM.

[03:20:59:29]
LMP: Okay. How do you read now, Joe?

[03:20:59:31]
CC:  Oh, that's much better. Go ahead.

[03:20:59:36]
_page : 450
_tape : Tape 63/12
LMP: Okay. I was just going to say we haven't had
     an overboard waste water dump since clear back
     around the other side of the Moon. About this
     time, we're running out of the bags we've got
     on board here.

[03:21:00:03]
CC: Okay. I'm - I'm stupid this morning, Fred. I'm
     not quite sure what you are getting at.

[03:21:00:14]
LMP: Okay, Joe. We need some place to put the urine.

[03:21:00:18]
CC:  Okay. It sounds to me as if the suggested receptacle 
     is perfectly satisfactory. Do you
     think you can use it in its present configuration?

[03:21:00:34]
LMP: Oh, yes. We got all the innerconnects - hookups
     we need, but I wasn't sure if that gadget was
     devised solely with the 1/6g environment in mind,
     and whether it might leak somehow in zero g.

[03:21:00:50]
CC:  I'll have them verify that, but off the top of
     my head, I'm sure it's going to be all right.
     We'll check it, Fred.

[03:21:00:59]
LMP: Okay.

[03:21:05:22]
LMP: Okay. How do you read, Joe?

[03:21:11:53]
LMP: Houston, Aquarius.

[03:21:12:01]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.

[03:21:12:06]
LMP: Okay, Joe. One thing I've noticed, that a
     couple of circuits there now - the pulse ... -
     at least the number of them, is markedly decreased, and ... rather bad and, apparently, that
     added venting we had out of the service module
     was some overboard relief valve, maybe letting
     go, because it appears to have stopped now.

[03:21:12:38]
CC:  Okay, Fred. Copy that. Thank you.

[03:21:23:14]
LMP: Houston, Aquarius.

[03:21:23:17]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.

[03:21:23:24]
LMP: What do you read down there for partial pressure
     CO<sub>2</sub>?

[03:21:23:29]
CC:  Oh, let's see. We're reading 6.6 right now,
     Fred. What do you read?

[03:21:23:38]
_page : 451
_tape : Tape 63/13
LMP: I'm reading about 12.5. I guess we've got a
     gage problem ... I did just get a MASTER ALARM 
     and no caution light; we kind of figured that's
     what it was, with CO<sub>2</sub> approaching its limit.
     Maybe it didn't quite come out here.

[03:21:23:59]
CC:  Okay. Let me get a go, and I think it's time
     for us to go ahead and put these other canisters
     on. Stand by 1.

[03:21:24:08]
LMP:  Okay. We went to 15 on the primary last night
     before I changed it and - -

[03:21:24:16]
CC: Roger that, Fred. We wanted to - -

[03:21:24:18]
LMP: - - I don't have a steady - I don't have a
     steady [glossary:ECS] light on at this time, Joe, so it
     must have just been a momentary.

[03:21:24:28]
CC:  Okay. We know when you went to 15 last night
     on primary. We want to switch out today at 7.6.
     Let me check and see if we're ready.

[03:21:24:41]
LMP: Okay.

[03:21:25:13]
LMP: Yes. That's what it is, Joe. I've got something
     going on this alarm ... [glossary:ECS] light.

[03:21:25:24]
CC: Fred, Houston. The COMM isn't too sharp and I
     didn't copy.

[03:21:26:34]
CC: Okay, Aquarius; Houston - -

[03:21:26:37]
LMP: Houston, Aquarius. How do you read?

[03:21:26:38]
CC:  - - Why don't you try it now? You're loud and
     clear now, Fred.

[03:21:26:42]
LMP: Okay. I was just - I'm getting MASTER ALARMS
     every few seconds and I am catching a glimmer
     now of the [glossary:ECS] light. For the time being, I
     have ... - ... open. Okay, now we got the [glossary:ECS]
     light on steady.

[03:21:27:07]
CC:  Okay. Copy that. You have the MASTER ALARM,
     with the [glossary:ECS] light. We are ready to go ahead
     and get you on the command module canisters.
     And as the first step, I'd like to know whether
     you've inserted the commander's red hose to the
     second canister bag. Over.

[03:21:27:29]
_page : 452
_tape : Tape 63/14
LMP: Okay. Yes. Sure enough; the commander's red
     hose is inserted into the canister bag.

[03:21:27:39]
CC:  Okay, Fred. The next thing I'd like you to do
     is to take some more gray tape and tape over
     half the outlet area of each of the blue nozzles;
     the commander's and the LMP's. The reason we're
     doing this is we're going to be running this loop
     through the secondary LiOH canister hole with
     the canister removed, and we don't have the flow
     restriction we need to keep the separator from
     overspeeding. Over.

[03:21:28:11]
LMP: Okay. Yes, that's right. So we want to tape
     over half of the - both the blue and the red
     commander hoses. Is that right?

[03:21:28:22]
CC:  Negative, Fred. That's half of the commander's
     blue hose and half of the LMP's blue hose - the
     outlet hoses.

[03:21:28:31]
LMP: Oh, okay. I'll tape over half of each of the
     outlets. Stand by.

[03:21:28:37]
CC:  Okay.

[03:21:31:40]
LMP: Okay. I'm going to turn off one suit flow valve
     at a time while I am doing the taping, Joe.

[03:21:31:51]
CC:  Say again, please, Fred.

[03:21:31:56]
LMP: Okay, while I'm doing the taping, I'll have that
     particular suit flow valve in the suit DISCONNECT 
     position momentarily.

[03:21:32:03]
CC:  Okay. Fine.

[03:21:43:46]
LMP: Okay. How do you read now, Joe?

[03:21:43:49]
CC:  Okay, Fred. Reasonable COMM. Are you ready for
     the next step? Over.

[03:21:43:57]
LMP: Okay. One correction - the red hose that's connected 
     up right now to the lithium cartridge in
     the LMP's - Wait a minute.

[03:21:44:17]
CC:  Okay, Fred. Understand only the LMP's red hose
     is actually plugged into the canister bag. In
     that case, we would like you to follow the procedure 
     for inserting the other red hose in the     other canister bag as follows: you cut a diagonal 
     hole in one corner of the bag. Look at the
     other bag and see how it was done. Stick the
     hose in about 6 inches. Try to get the outlet
     nozzle down if you can, or else sideways, and
     then just tape up the hose to the bag to make a
     nice tight seal. Over.

[03:21:45:02]
_page : 453
_tape : Tape 63/15
LMP: Okay. Jack's back in here. I guess he can do
     that. Stand by.

[03:21:45:08]
CC:  Okay.

[03:21:45:58]
LMP: How do you read, Joe?

[03:21:46:00]
CC:  Okay, Fred. Is that done? Over.

[03:21:46:06]
LMP: No. That's still in works. I just wanted to
     comment you might pass on to Steve Grega, we
     thank you a lot for those rendezvous procedures.
     They went to making up these little boxes.

[03:21:46:29]
CC:  Okay. We appreciate your appreciating it. We're
     just having a ball down here working on all kinds
     of new procedures, Fred. The [glossary:CPCB] is in session,
     and we expect to have your entry procedures out
     here by Saturday or Sunday at the very latest.

[03:21:46:50]
LMP: Saturday or Sunday?

[03:21:46:52]
CC:  At the very latest!

[03:21:47:14]
LMP: Take your time, Jack.

[03:21:47:36]
LMP: Why don't you run that other hose back up in the
     tunnel so Jim can get some air.

[03:21:47:54]
LMP: Yes. I got it.

[03:21:51:52]
LMP: And Joe, how you read now?

[03:21:51:55]
CC:  Satisfactory, Fred. Go ahead.

[03:21:52:01]
LMP: Okay. Back to the condensate container. I
     guess the only question I really need answered
     is will it leak?

[03:21:52:11]
CC:  Is will it leak? Oh, yes. Stand by 1.

[03:21:52:22]
LMP: And we've checked all the fittings and I know I
     can hook everything up to our UCDs. So, if it
     doesn't leak, we can transfer.

[03:21:52:31]
_page : 454
_tape : Tape 63/16
CC:  Okay, Fred. We still don't have a final answer
     on whether or not it'll leak. If you need it,
     I'd go ahead and use it; and standing by for
     your completion of the hose-insertion procedure.

[03:21:52:52]
LMP: Okay. The hose-insertion procedure ... the
     second cartridge is complete.

[03:21:52:59]
CC:  Okay. That's complete. The next step is to
     switch to the primary CO<sub>2</sub> canister and remove
     the secondary canister and stow it. Over.

[03:21:53:14]
LMP: Okay. I'm going to have to get off COMM here;
     I'll let Jack get the headset.

[03:21:53:19]
CC:  Okay.

[03:21:53:28]
CMP: Hey, Joe. I'm on the headset now.

[03:21:54:06]
LMP: Is that secondary? ... secondary?

[03:21:54:24]
LMP: Both cartridges are out.

[03:21:54:33]
CMP: Okay, Joe. Fred has the secondary cartridge out.
     We're back on primary now.

[03:21:54:39]
_extra : END OF TAPE
CC:  Okay, Jack. The next step is to place the command 
     module canisters with the hoses attached in
     a suitable location to permit the bottom of the
     canister to be exposed to free airflow and tape
     them in place. Ideally, well, it doesn't matter.
     Just - just pick out your own spot.

[03:21:55:05]
_page : 455
_tape : Tape 64/1
CMP: Okay. I'm going to tell you where they are.
     They're both situated, as you say, with the
     bottom of the canister exposed to free air, and
     one is sitting right by the - the LMP's is sitting 
     right by the [glossary:EPS] panel, and the CDR's is
     up in the tunnel.

[03:21:55:26]
CC:  Jack, Houston. The COMM got real noisy there,
     and I didn't copy that. Stand by a moment.

[03:21:56:02]
CMP: Okay, Joe. How do you read now?

[03:21:56:04]
CC:  Okay. That's real good, Jack; go ahead.

[03:21:56:09]
CMP: Okay. The canisters are situated as you - as
     you would like with the bottom of the canister
     exposed to free air.

[03:21:56:17]
CC:  Okay.

[03:21:56:18]
CMP: The position of the LMP's canister - The LMP's
     canister is sitting on the [glossary:EPS] panel now, and
     the CDR's canister is positioned up in the tunnel.

[03:21:56:31]
CC:  Okay. Real fine, Jack. The next step is to
     physically separate both blue hoses a good distance 
     away from the canister so that we don't
     short circuit the flow, and tape them in place;
     and the ideal location for them would be up in
     the tunnel so as to get some flow into the command 
     module. Over.

[03:21:56:57]
CMP: Both hoses in the - up into the command module?

[03:21:57:03]
CC:  Oh, you can use your judgment on that, Jack.
     We'd like at least one, and the recommendation
     that I got was to put them both up in the tunnel.

[03:21:57:15]
CMP: Okay. We have the LMP's blue hose up by the
     LMP's window and the - Of course, the red hose
     is separated by some 4 feet. And the - Okay.
     We're going to - and the other hose - the - has
     the extension on it - The CDR's blue hose, of
     course, has the extension on it, and it's blowing way up in the command module. And the red
     hose is about - Oh, it's right at the docking
     ring where the blue latches are, so there's about
     4 or 5 feet difference from there, too. Is this
     satisfactory?

[03:21:58:03]
_page : 456
_tape : Tape 64/2
CC:  Okay, Jack. That sounds satisfactory. The next
     steps are - are suit-loop configuration steps,
     and the first one is to - - 

[03:21:58:14]
CMP: Okay. SUIT DIV - -

[03:21:58:17]
CC:  - - is to place the SUIT DIVERTER valve to the
     PULL EGRESS position.

[03:21:58:26]
CMP: Okay. SUIT DIVERTER valve to PULL EGRESS.

[03:21:58:31]
CC:  That's affirmative - -

[03:21:58:32]
CMP: That's done - -

[03:21:58:33]
CC:  Okay. The next step is CABIN GAS RETURN to
     EGRESS. Over.

[03:21:58:43]
SC:  ...

[03:21:59:24]
CC:  Okay, Jack. Did you copy CABIN GAS RETURN to
     EGRESS? Over.

[03:21:59:32]
CMP: No, I didn't get that, Joe. CABIN GAS RETURN
     to EGRESS.

[03:21:59:37]
CC:  That's correct.

[03:21:59:43]
CMP: Okay. That's done.

[03:21:59:45]
CC:  Okay. Next, SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF to CLOSE. Over.

[03:21:59:52]
CMP: SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF to CLOSE.

[03:21:59:55]
CC:  Roger.

[03:22:00:01]
CMP: Okay. I got that done.

[03:22:00:03]
CC:  Okay. And the last step is select secondary
     CO<sub>2</sub> canister. We'll let it flow through the
     empty hole, and let's see how we do.

[03:22:00:13]
CMP: Select secondary CO<sub>2</sub> canister.

[03:22:00:16]
CC:  Roger, Jack. That completes that procedure, and
     the next thing I've got for you is a procedure
     for going back into the command module and powering 
     up the main buses temporarily using the BUS
     TIE switches. We want to do this for two reasons:
     first of all, we want it absolutely verified that
     there are no loads on the main buses, that we've
     got everything off and that the buses look good;
     and the second thing we want to do is to power
     the bus - the main buses, with the BUS TIE motor
     switches, and then depower them by pulling the
     circuit breakers, leaving the MAIN BUS TIE switches
     in the on position, just to assure that they'll
     be there when we need them, whether the batteries
     get cold or not. Over.

[03:22:01:33]
_page : 457
_tape : Tape 64/3
CMP: Okay, Joe. How you read?

[03:22:01:36]
CC:  Better now, Jack. Satisfactory. Did you copy
     my rationale for the main bus powerup?

[03:22:01:45]
CMP: Yes, I did. You want to remove - You want to
     power up both buses, with the BUS TIE motor
     switches; first of all, to see that there are
     no loads on the buses, and second, and then
     depower the buses by pulling the circuit breakers
     to insure that the motor switches don't - that
     the BUS TIES stay on so that they're there when
     we need them.

[03:22:02:09]
CC:  That's correct, Jack. Are you ready to copy the
     procedure?

[03:22:02:15]
CMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[03:22:02:16]
CC:  Okay. As the first step, I have one change to
     the basic configuration that we gave you, and
     it's two more circuit breakers that we want open.
     On panel 225 - Are you ready to write that down?
     Over.

[03:22:02:35]
CMP: Yes. I'm all ready, Joe. Go ahead.

[03:22:02:48]
CMP: Joe, I'm all ready. Go ahead.

[03:22:02:50]
CC:  Okay. On panel 225, we want the RENDEZVOUS
     TRANSPONDER FLIGHT BUS circuit breaker open, and
     the S-BAND FM TRANSMITTER/[glossary:DSE] FLIGHT BUS circuit
     breaker open. Over.

[03:22:03:24]
CMP: Okay. TV RENDEZVOUS TRANSPONDER FLIGHT BUS,
     open; TV S-BAND TRANSMITTER/[glossary:DSE] FLIGHT BUS open
     on panel 225.

[03:22:03:35]
_page : 458
_tape : Tape 64/4
CC:  Okay. That's correct, Jack. And now we'll go
     into the main bus powerup procedure. And the
     first step there, is on panel 5. We want the
     BAT CHARGER BAT A CHARGE circuit breaker closed,
     and the BAT CHARGER BAT B CHARGE circuit breaker
     closed. Over.

[03:22:04:15]
CMP: Okay. That's BAT CHARGER BAT A CHARGE, BAT
     CHARGER BAT B CHARGE, both closed on panel 5.

[03:22:04:25]
CC:  That's affirmative. We need them closed to power
     the switches. Next on panel 5, we want the [glossary:EPS]
     SENSOR SIGNAL MAIN A and MAIN B circuit breakers
     closed. Over.

[03:22:04:52]
CMP: Okay. Panel 5, CB [glossary:EPS] sensor's signals MAIN A
     and MAIN B closed.

[03:22:05:00]
CC:  Okay. That's affirmative. We need them closed
     so that you can read out your volts and amps.
     Next step, on panel 250, we want circuit breaker
     BAT A POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING and BAT B POWER
     ENTRY and POSTLANDING, closed. Over.

[03:22:05:35]
CMP: Okay on panel 250, CB BAT A POWER, ENTRY and
     POSTLANDING, closed; BAT B POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, closed.

[03:22:05:50]
CC:  That's affirmative. And at that point, we'd like
     you to check the BAT bus voltages on both BAT
     buses to make sure we don't have any shorts.
     Over.

[03:22:06:09]
CMP: Okay. Read the BAT bus voltages on BAT BUS A
     and BAT BUS B.

[03:22:06:13]
CC:  That's affirmative. The next step on panel 275:
     circuit breaker MAIN A, BAT BUS A, closed, and
     circuit breaker MAIN B, BAT BUS B, closed. Over.

[03:22:06:44]
CMP: Okay. On 275, circuit breakers MAIN A, BAT BUS A,
     closed; MAIN B, BAT BUS B, closed.

[03:22:06:56]
CC:  That's affirmative. The next step on panel 5:
     we want the MAIN BUS TIE A/C switch to the BAT
     A/C position, and verify proper voltage on MAIN
     BUS A, and read the amps on BAT A to make sure
     we don't have a short. Over.

[03:22:07:29]
CMP: Okay. ...

[03:22:07:46]
_page : 459
_tape : Tape 64/5
CC:  Okay, Jack; Houston. We're in bad COMM again;
     let's wait a minute.

[03:22:08:03]
CMP: Okay. How do you read ...?

[03:22:08:04]
CC:  That's better, Jack. Go ahead with your readback.

[03:22:08:10]
CMP: Okay. Place MAIN BUS TIE A/C, on, read MAIN
     BUS A current and voltage.

[03:22:08:19]
CC:  Okay. That's affirmative. The next step will
     be the MAIN BUS TIE B/C switch to the on position
     and read MAIN B voltage and battery B amperage
     as above. Over.

[03:22:08:49]
CMP: Okay, MAIN BUS TIE B/C on; read MAIN B voltage
     and current.

[03:22:08:55]
CC:  Okay. That is correct. Then to reconfigure
     from this configuration, Jack, we want you to
     leave the MAIN BUS TIE switches in the on position 
     and pull the circuit breakers out in reverse
     order that we had you close them. Over; and do
     you want me to read them up individually?

[03:22:09:17]
CMP: No, let me see if I've got it here. I go down
     to panel 275, open CB MAIN A, BAT BUS A and CB
     MAIN B, BAT BUS B. Then I go down to 250, and
     pull CB BAT A POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING and BAT B
     POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING and then up on panel 5,
     pull [glossary:EPS] SENSOR SIGNAL MAIN A, SENSOR SIGNAL
     MAIN B, BATTERY CHARGER BAT B CHARGE, BATTERY
     CHARGER BAT A CHARGE. And then close - I don't
     know whether you want me to close the RENDEZVOUS
     RADAR TRANSPONDER FLIGHT BUS and S-BAND
     TRANSMITTER/[glossary:DSE] FLIGHT BUS.

[03:22:10:03]
CC:  Okay, Jack. We don't want you to close those
     last two. Those are changes to your basic configuration, 
     and we want to leave them open for 
     now. Over.

[03:22:10:15]
CMP: Okay. I'll do that. Was the rest of the readback okay?

[03:22:10:17]
CC:  That's correct. Readback was 100 percent, and
     we'll wait to hear from you.

[03:22:10:32]
_page : 460
_tape : Tape 64/6
CMP: Okay, Joe. And just for confirmation, I went
     through the switch list you gave me. We are in
     exactly that configuration with one exception,
     and that is over on panel 382. I have not, the
     a - H<sub>2</sub>O ACCUMULATOR is in the OFF position so
     that if we need any more water, we can get it.

[03:22:11:05]
CC:  Okay. Roger, Jack. Copy that. On panel 382,
     you've left the H<sub>2</sub>O ACCUMULATOR valves in the
     OFF position, and we concur.

[03:22:11:16]
CMP: Okay. And there's one other thing that I don't
     know whether you're aware of. We have no lithium
     hydroxide canisters in panel two fif- in - canisters 
     now. So when we get ready to power up,
     you'll have to remind us when you want us to add
     some.

[03:22:11:38]
CC:  Okay, Jack. We copy that. That's correct, and
     I'll add that to our basic checklist so that we
     won't forget it.

[03:22:11:47]
CMP: Okay. Real fine, Joe, and I'm on my way back
     into the command module.

[03:22:11:51]
CC:  Good deal.

[03:22:11:53]
CMP: Thank you.

[03:22:12:04]
LMP: How do you read, Joe?

[03:22:12:19]
LMP: And, Joe, how do you read Aquarius?

[03:22:12:23]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Pretty good. Go ahead.

[03:22:12:29]
LMP: Okay. I'm back on the line now, but Jack really
     ... headed back to the upstairs bedroom.

[03:22:12:39]
CC:  Okay. Roger that, Fred.

[03:22:13:01]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[03:22:13:06]
LMP: Go ahead.

[03:22:13:07]
CC:  Okay, Fred. We recommend that you push your
     MASTER ALARM circuit breaker in so you'll have
     audio and visual on that, and, also, we medical
     types are getting to feel left out down here, and
     we'd like you to give us BIOMED ... position, if
     you're plugged in for it, and we'll see whether
     it affects the voice or not. Over.

[03:22:13:36]

LMP: Okay.

[03:22:14:22]
LMP: Hey, Houston; Aquarius. On DOWN VOICE BACKUP
     S-band, how do you read me?

[03:22:14:28]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Read you now satisfactory.

[03:22:14:36]
LMP: Okay. And that's my ...

[03:22:14:39]
CC:  Okay. Thank you very much, Fred.

[03:22:14:46]
LMP: Actually, a good deal of that little power pack
     heats up and ...

[03:22:14:53]
CC:  Roger that.

[03:22:19:11]
LMP: Houston, Aquarius.

[03:22:19:12]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.

[03:22:19:18]
LMP: Okay, Jack just ... himself back down. And after
     he put on the 250 BAT A, BAT B breakers, he read
     BAT bus volts as 32.3 on A, 37.0 on B; he then
     punched in the 275 breakers, which tied the
     batteries to the buses, and at that time he read
     the A bus volts 32.0 on A, zero amps; 37.0 on B,
     zero amps.

[03:22:19:59]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. The COMM got noisy there,
     and I want to make sure we get these numbers
     right, so I'd like to ask you to repeat them ...

[03:22:21:00]
LMP: Okay. How do you read now, Joe?

[03:22:21:01]
CC:  Okay; probably okay, Fred. Read it nice and
     slow so we'll be sure to get it. Over.

[03:22:21:10]
LMP: Okay. Jack pushed in the 250 BAT A, BAT B entry
     breakers. He read battery bus volts as 32.3 on
     A, 37.0 on B. Then he pushed in the 275 breakers
     tying the BATs to the main buses. In this configuration, 
     MAIN A is at 32.0 volts, zero amps;
     MAIN B is at 37.0 volts, zero amps. So it looks
     like the buses are okay.

[03:22:21:47]
CC:  Okay, Fred. Copy those numbers and thank you
     very much. I assume you got them off all right.

[03:22:22:00]
LMP: That's affirm. We got all the breakers pulled
     again.

[03:22:22:03]
CC:  Okay. Real fine.

[03:22:32:33]
_page : 462
_tape : Tape 64/8
LMP: Hey, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read?

[03:22:32:38]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.

[03:22:32:43]
LMP: Okay. How did our ... configurations appear to
     be working down there?

[03:22:32:54]
CC:  I'm sorry, Fred, but we got noisy again there.

[03:22:33:02]
LMP: Okay. Let me know when you want me to try it.

[03:22:33:05]
CC:  Okay. That sounds better already. Go ahead.

[03:22:33:11]
LMP: Okay. I'd just like to ... how's - how's our
     lith-o cartridge setup ... appear to be
     working down there.

[03:22:33:21]
CC:  We are reading 0.2 on our CO<sub>2</sub> sets here, and
     we're all delighted. It seems to be working
     fine.

[03:22:33:31]
LMP: Boy, that is great.

[03:22:33:40]
CC:  And Fred, Houston. In a little while here, I'm
     going to have a procedure that I want to read up
     to you and have you copy down for future use.
     It's a procedure for powering the command module
     main bus off the [glossary:LM], and it's something that we
     feel that's going to come in real handy later on
     for such things as popping off the command module
     entry batteries, and also possibly for doing some
     preheating and preliminary powering up of the
     command module before we get rid of the [glossary:LM]. We'll
     have that for you in probably 10 or 15 minutes.
     Over.

[03:22:34:25]
LMP: Okay, okay, Joe. That's good. Sounds good.

[03:22:34:31]
CC:  Roger.

[03:22:36:11]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[03:22:36:16]
LMP: Go ahead.

[03:22:36:18]
CC:  Okay, Fred. Our procedure-generating mill has
     generated another very short one for you here.
     It's a procedure for getting an onboard read-out - -

[03:22:36:27]
LMP: Stand by 1, Joe.

[03:22:36:38]
CC:  Okay.

[03:22:37:02]
_page : 463
_tape : Tape 64/9
LMP: Okay, Joe. Go ahead.

[03:22:37:05]
CC: Okay, Fred. This is a procedure for getting a
     read-out of the descent propellant tank temps.
     It's no big problem, but our [glossary:LM] people say that
     the bottom of the descent stage is probably cooling 
     off, and we just want to verify that the
     descent water tank will be okay. Right now, it
     looks as though it won't freeze until several
     hours after it's empty, but we want to have you
     read these temperatures out to us so we can see
     how good our predictions are. The procedure is,
     on panel 16, close the PROPELLANT DISPLAY/ENGINE
     OVERRIDE LOGIC circuit breaker. Over.

[03:22:38:12]
LMP: Okay. The PROPELLANT DISPLAY OVERRIDE circuit
     breakers are closed. ... the propellant.

[03:22:38:21]
CC:  Right, Fred. The next step is simply to turn
     the PROPELLANT TEMP PRESS MONITOR switch to
     DESCENT 1, read the fuel and OX temps, turn it
     to DESCENT 2, read the fuel and OX temps; tell
     us what they are.

[03:22:38:44]
LMP: Okay. On DESCENT 1, I get a fuel temp of
     66.5 degrees, OX ... on DESCENT 2, I get ...

[03:22:39:05]
CC:  Okay, Fred. We're in noisy COMM here; I got
     DESCENT 1 fuel 66.5; stand by a second.

[03:22:39:35]
LMP: Okay. How do you read, now ...?

[03:22:39:37]
CC:  That's better. Go ahead.

[03:22:39:47]
LMP: Okay. You got 66.5 on DESCENT 1 fuel temp,
     oxidizer temp is 66 degrees.

[03:22:39:53]
CC:  Okay. Copy - -

[03:22:39:54]
LMP: On DESCENT TANK 2, fuel is reading 60 - Okay.
     DESCENT 2 fuel is reading 68 degrees; oxidizer,
     65 degrees.

[03:22:40:03]
CC:  Okay. Copy that, Fred. Thank you. We'd like
     you to pull the circuit breaker, and we'll probably 
     come to you again in 5 or 6 hours for another
     check.

[03:22:40:14]
LMP: Okay. The panel 16 ... ... ENGINE ... OVERRIDE
     is open.

[03:22:40:19]

[03:22:46:28]
CC: Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[03:22:46:59]
CC: Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[03:22:47:05]
LMP: Go ahead.

[03:22:47:10]
CC:  Okay. We're chasing a small glitch that we saw
     a while ago in the O<sub>2</sub> flow rate which is now
     normal again, but what we'd like you to do is,
     first of all, to tell us whether, during that
     canister procedure, you moved O<sub>2</sub> DEMAND REG A
     to any position other than CABIN, and then we'd
     like you to move it to OFF momentarily and back
     to CABIN for us.

[03:22:47:39]
LMP: Okay. To answer your question, Joe, it's no.
     I checked the CABIN all the time. Qualitatively,
     when we switched to this configuration, it didn't
     seem like the frequency or the suit fan noise ...
     decreased ... logged down a little bit, but I'll
     follow your procedure. You want me to take REG A,
     go to close and back to CABIN; is that correct?

[03:22:48:10]
CC:  That's correct, Fred.

[03:22:48:15]
LMP: Okay. We're in close.

[03:22:48:18]
CC:  Okay.

[03:22:48:22]
LMP: Now, I'm back to CABIN.

[03:22:48:24]
CC:  Okay. Thank you very much, Fred. I'll get back
     to you if we see anything.

[03:22:50:17]
SC:  (Music - The Age of Aquarius)

[03:22:50:42]

[03:22:50:47]
CC:  Hey, have you guys got a woman on board?

[03:22:50:57]
LMP: No way I could handle that.

[03:22:51:30]
LMP: And, Joe, do you have the ... out for the ...?

[03:22:51:39]
CC:  I'm not sure I copied that, Fred. If you asked
     me whether I had that powerup procedure, I don't
     have it for you, yet. Over.

[03:22:51:54]
_page : 465
_tape : Tape 64/11
LMP: No. The question was, do you have a ... from
     the Moon burn.

[03:22:52:04]
CC:  Still didn't understand, Fred. I'm sorry.

[03:22:52:08]
LMP: Okay. We'll be able to get better COMM.

[03:22:52:09]
CC:  Roger.

[03:22:53:00]
LMP: Okay.

[03:22:53:55]
CC:  Fred, Houston. You want to try it, now?

[03:22:54:12]
LMP: How do you read, Houston?

[03:22:54:14]
CC:  That's pretty good, Fred.

[03:22:54:19]
LMP: Okay. Two things: first of all, we noticed a
     ...

[03:22:54:30]
CC: Gol darn it. Just as you started talking, it
     got noisy again, Fred; try it again.

[03:22:54:37]
LMP: Okay.

[03:22:54:45]
CC:  Try it now, loud and slow.

[03:22:54:51]
LMP: Okay. Jack had a question on how far out from
     the Moon are we now?

[03:22:55:04]
CC:  On how far out what?

[03:22:55:08]
LMP: From the Moon we are now?

[03:22:55:10]
CC:  Oh. Our little plot shows you just touching the
     180-thousand-mile line. So you're about 40 K
     out from the Moon.

[03:22:55:20]
LMP: Okay. Okay. And the other thing is, we've
     noticed some fresh new particles floating around
     outside, so possibly the service module is starting 
     to vent a little bit again.

[03:22:55:39]
CC:  Okay. Copy that, Fred. On the O<sub>2</sub> flow thing,
     we clearly saw the DEMAND REGULATOR go to OFF
     and back to CABIN. [glossary:TELMU] thinks that it's
     no big thing that you've seen a little change
     in flow due to the different resistance we've
     got in the circuit.

[03:22:56:33]
LMP: Go ahead.

[03:22:56:35]
CC: Okay, Fred. Recommend you go to OFF on the
     BIOMED switch. We never did get any BIOMED and
     it might clear up the COMM a little bit.

[03:22:56:49]
LMP: Okay. How you read now?

[03:22:56:52]
CC:  Okay, Fred. That might be a little better.

[03:22:59:43]
LMP: Go to the - Go to the technique for a lash and
     ... it's the burn technique.

[03:23:00:02]
LMP: I'm sure they got something written out, maybe ...

[03:23:00:09]
CMP: A what?

[03:23:00:13]
LMP: Well, hell, Jack. All you - you don't use a very
     good one ... Just if you'll go ... at your attitude 
     reference for ... and the g-meter backup.
     Because, really, you can almost ... The command
     module and your odds are 60 to 40 that you're
     going to hit Earth blunt-end first, without any
     reference.

[03:23:00:38]
CMP: ... I didn't realize that. That proves you've
     got a little bit above 50-percent odds that you're
     going to enter blunt end, and -

[03:23:00:49]
LMP: We made an entry like that in Apollo 8 in a ...
     with Houston, ol' Buzz went and turned on the
     command module heaters and left them on. The
     activators, they went, "Shooo!" both tanks; we
     had no gas. Just had a real slow rate ... We
     actually went out in the console and started
     debriefing, but left it running and watched it;
     and the son of a bitch did a hop-skipout, a
     hopout, underneath ..., but not much, and then
     we did a long hop ... but - The second reentry,
     also, it did one ... both times. It lucked out
     twice and made a real peculiar ... They went to

[03:23:06:11]
LMP: Okay, Joe. It - Our wobble in this [glossary:PTC] has
     picked up where the Moon is running by pretty
     high in the window and the Earth pretty low; so
     I expect - On the side where the Moon's present,
     we're having a little bit of trouble with the 
     COMM ... breakout there in a couple of places.

     thing from the AFT. ...

[03:23:09:10]
CMP: Houston, Aquarius.

[03:23:09:13]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Go.

[03:23:09:20]
CMP: Okay, Joe. I'm all set to copy that procedure
     for powering up the command module from the [glossary:LM],
     whenever you want to give it to me. When did
     you, I guess you want to put battery A out of the
     CHARGE, huh?

[03:23:09:32]
CC:  Jack, we're not certain when the best time is to
     implement this procedure, and what we want to do
     at this time is read it up to you, so you'll
     have it and understand it and we'll - We'll be
     able to do it quickly when the time comes. And
     I don't have it for you quite yet. Over.

[03:23:09:56]
CMP: (Laughter) Okay. All right. I'll be standing
     by to copy it whenever you get it.

[03:23:10:03]
CC:  Okay, Jack.

[03:23:11:34]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[03:23:11:42]
CMP: Joe, I got to switch antennas here. Okay, Joe,
     I read you on the FORWARD antenna.

[03:23:11:52]
CC:  Okay, Jack, I have the procedure now to read up
     to you. Before I do, I want to mention something
     that will be of interest to Fred. We are looking
     at the SHe tank pressure rise and we expect it to
     blow. We don't know exactly what time it will go,
     somewhere around 105 hours or perhaps later than
     that. We've got plenty of blowdown capability.
     We just thought you ought to be informed.

[03:23:12:23]
CMP: Okay. Stand by. I'll tell him, now.

[03:23:12:27]
CC:  Okay.

[03:23:12:28]
CMP: Fred, they said they're looking at the SHe tank
     pressure rise, and they expect it to blow somewhere 
     around 105 hours ... Okay. Fred thought
     they did. ...

[03:23:12:48]
_page : 469
_tape : Tape 64/15
CC:  Okay. Real fine. Are you ready for the procedure,
     now, Jack?

[03:23:12:55]
CMP: Yes. Joe, how long is it? Is it a big long one,
     or a short one, or a medium sized ... about how
     many pages?

[03:23:13:01]
CC:  It's about - I'd say 15 to 20 steps, Jack. Some
     of it is [glossary:LM] stuff, and the rest of it is in [glossary:CSM].

[03:23:13:15]
CMP: Okay. I got a fresh page here, and I'm ready to
     copy.

[03:23:13:18]
CC:  Okay. I'll give you the [glossary:LM] steps first. They
     have to be done first, and the first step is on
     panels 11 and 16, circuit breakers ASCENT CA,
     ASC ECA, two to close.

[03:23:13:42]
CMP: Okay. Panels 11 and 16 CBs ASCENT ECA to closed.

[03:23:13:50]
CC:  Okay. Next step: panels 11 and 16 CB ASCENT
     ECA CONTROL, two, to close. Over.

[03:23:14:11]
CMP: Okay. On 11 and 16 CBs ASCENT ECA CONTROLs to
     close.

[03:23:14:19]
CC:  Okay. That's correct. The next step is BAT 5
     and 6 NORMAL FEED to high; those are switches.

[03:23:14:41]
CMP: Okay. BATs 5 and 6 NORMAL FEED, ON.

[03:23:14:46]
CC:  That's correct. Next step: BATs 1 and 3 to OFF
     slash RESET. Over.

[03:23:15:05]
CMP: BATs 1 and 3 to OFF slash RESET.

[03:23:15:09]
CC:  That's correct. Next step: wait 30 minutes for
     preconditioning.

[03:23:15:23]
CMP: Okay. That's wait 30 minutes for preconditioning.

[03:23:15:29]
CC:  That's correct, and the last [glossary:LM] step for now is
     BATs 2 and 4 to OFF/RESET.

[03:23:15:50]
CMP: Okay. BATs 2 and 4 to OFF/RESET.

[03:23:15:55]
CC:  That's correct. Now we'll go to the [glossary:CSM], and
     the first step there is connect [glossary:LM]/[glossary:CSM] umbilical.
     Over.

[03:23:16:13]
_page : 470
_tape : Tape 64/16
CMP: Okay. Connect [glossary:LM]/[glossary:CSM] umbilical.

[03:23:16:17]
CC: Okay. The next step, on panel 5, CB [glossary:LM] POWER-1 
     MAIN B and [glossary:LM] POWER-2 MAIN B, both, closed. Over.

[03:23:16:43]
CMP: Okay. On panel 5, CB [glossary:LM] POWER-1 MAIN B and 2
     MAIN B, both, closed.

[03:23:16:52]
CC:  That's correct. On panel 5, CB [glossary:EPS] SENSOR SIGNAL
     MAIN B to close. Over.

[03:23:17:11]
CMP: [glossary:EPS] SENSOR SIGNAL MAIN B closed on panel 5.

[03:23:17:16]
CC:  That's correct. Next step, panel 250: CB BAT C
     POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING; closed. Over.

[03:23:17:40]
CMP: Okay. On panel 250: CB BAT B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING,
     closed.

[03:23:17:50]
CC: That's Charlie. Verify MAIN BUS voltage; then,
     [glossary:LM] POWER switch on panel 2 to [glossary:CSM]. Over.

[03:23:18:14]
CMP: Okay. That's verify the MAIN BUS voltage, and
     switch [glossary:LM] POWER to [glossary:CSM].

[03:23:18:23]
CC:  Okay. That's correct. Then go back to 275, CB
     MAIN B BAT BUS B to open. Hey, Jack, that's the
     step I skipped for you, I'm afraid. Before
     verifying MAIN BUS voltage, you have to, on panel
     275, close CB MAIN B BAT BUS B. Over.

[03:23:19:07]
CMP: Okay, Joe. How are you reading on the AFT OMNI.

[03:23:19:11]
CC:  You're okay now. Go ahead.

[03:23:19:15]
CMP: Okay. After putting the BATTERY B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING
     on, then I want to push the - on
     panel 275 MAIN B to BAT BUS B in, huh?

[03:23:19:38]
CC:  That's right. Then you go to verify MAIN BUS
     voltage, [glossary:LM] POWER to [glossary:CSM], and then, on panel 275,
     circuit breaker MAIN B BAT BUS B to open. Over.

[03:23:19:53]
CMP: Okay. After verifying the MAIN BUS voltage connecting 
     the [glossary:LM] POWER to [glossary:CSM] I want to pull MAIN
     B BAT BUS B, or MAIN B to BAT BUS B, open.

[03:23:20:06]
CC: That's correct. And then on panel 250, circuit
     breaker BAT B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING to open,
     and verify MAIN BUS B voltage.

[03:23:20:37]
_page : 471
_tape : Tape 64/17
CMP: Okay. Panel 250 BAT B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, 
     open, and then verify the MAIN BUS voltage.

[03:23:20:44]
CC: Okay. That's correct. The last steps are to
     get the [glossary:LM] back on descent batteries. The first 
     step is BATs 1, 2, 3, and 4, HI VOLTAGE, ON.
     Over.

[03:23:21:12]
CMP: Okay. Then the next step is a [glossary:LM] step, BATs 1, 
     2, 3, and 4, HI VOLTAGE, ON.

[03:23:21:19]
CC: That's correct; and the last step in the [glossary:LM],
     BATs 5 and 6 to OFF. Over.

[03:23:21:33]
CMP: Say again; you cut out there, Joe.

[03:23:21:36]
CC: Okay, Jack. The last step in the [glossary:LM], BATTERIES
     5 and 6 to OFF. Over.

[03:23:21:47]
CMP: Okay. BATs 5 and 6 go OFF.

[03:23:21:51]
CC:  That's correct. That should configure you. Note
     that circuit-breaker protection on that circuit
     limits the available current to 15 amps. We think
     we can do quite a bit with it though. And the
     [glossary:LM]/[glossary:CSM] umbilical will be hot and MAIN BUS voltage
     may be monitored by selecting MAIN B on the gage.
     Over.

[03:23:22:16]
CMP: Okay. Real fine.

[03:23:22:18]
CC:  Good deal, Jack.

[03:23:22:22]
CMP: Okay. And I'll be ready to implement this
     whenever you call it up.

[03:23:22:26]
CC:  Roger that.

[03:23:22:54]
LMP: And how do you read, Joe?

[03:23:22:56]
CC: Pretty good, Fred.

[03:23:23:00]
LMP: Okay. While Jack was on COMM, I was looking out
     the docking window here, and I could see another
     good shower of particles coming out of the service
     module. And the position this time appears to be
     on the other side. Before, we'd always seen them
     out of window 1, and where I'm looking at it from
     here, it looks like it'd be down below window 6
     somewhere in the service module. Jack's going
     upstairs to see what it looks like up there.

[03:23:23:33]
_page : 472
_tape : Tape 64/18
CC:  Okay. Good deal. We copy that, Fred. And to
     show you how relaxed we are about the entry, Ken
     is looking at - giving you guys a chance to -
     prior to going into entry, PREP to snap a few
     pictures of the service module.

[03:23:23:56]
LMP: Ken is, huh? (Laughter)

[03:23:24:02]
CC:  Yes, he's got all that film up there, and he
     doesn't want to waste it.

[03:23:24:06]
LMP: Oh, I thought maybe you'd want me to do a [glossary:PLSS]
     [glossary:EVA] to go shoot pictures or something.

[03:23:24:11]
CC:  Okay, okay.

[03:23:24:22]
LMP: You're right; we got a lot of pictures.

[03:23:24:34]
LMP: I guess I agree it surely would be nice to document 
     it someway if we can, but it doesn't look
     like ...

[03:23:24:45]
CC:  Yes, we think it'd be a lot of help.

[03:23:25:41]
LMP: Joe, how do you read me?

[03:23:25:45]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.

[03:23:25:50]
LMP: Okay. The condensate transfer worked great.

[03:23:25:57]
CC:  Stand by a minute, Fred. We're in a bad COMM
     mode.

[03:23:26:16]
LMP: Okay. How's that?

[03:23:26:17]
CC:  That's better.

[03:23:26:21]
LMP: Okay. The waste transfer into the condensate
     can works real well, Joe.

[03:23:26:29]
CC:  Okay. Good deal.

[03:23:26:33]
LMP: So, I guess we can keep [glossary:FIDO] happy with no overboard 
     dumps.

[03:23:26:39]
CC: Roger that.

[03:23:27:14]
LMP: Yes, that brings up one more possibility, Joe.

[03:23:27:19]
CC:  Say again, Fred.

[03:23:27:23]
_extra : END OF TAPE
_page : 473
_tape : Tape 64/19
LMP: Brings up another possibility. Now that we've
     got all of that stowed into the bags and the
     condensate can, we could probably blow all of
     that through the [glossary:PLSS] ..., I wonder how the
     sublimator would work on waste water.

[03:23:27:38]
_page : 474
_tape : Tape 65/1
CC: It might work if we had to do it, Fred. Right
     now we're looking at a comfortable excess of
     water through the sublimator. We were talking
     among ourselves this morning about having you
     try out the [glossary:PLSS] to ascent tank water-transfer
     situation and we decided not to do it, not to
     recommend it, because we figure it'd take us
     30 hours to empty one of the ascent tanks, which
     you have to do in order to get [glossary:PLSS] water to it,
     and we'd rather use the descent water and we don't
     think we've gotten any sweat. Over.

[03:23:28:21]
LMP: Okay, Joe. I don't think there's any question
     about it from the plumbing standpoint that we
     could do that if we had to.

[03:23:28:36]
CC:  Okay. Copy that.

[03:23:40:35]
LMP: And, how do you read, Joe?

[03:23:40:40]
CC:  Read you pretty good, Fred. Go ahead.

[03:23:40:45]
LMP: I think our [glossary:PTC] wobble is growing worse. The
     Earth now is really up to the top of the window.
     I have to get way down almost to the floorboards
     to view it. Conversely, the Moon is way down at
     the bottom of the window.

[03:23:41:06]
CC:  Okay.

[03:23:41:09]
LMP: A lot more wobble.

[03:23:41:10]
CC:  Roger - -

[03:23:41:11]
LMP: Far more wobble than I noticed on my previous
     watch.

[03:23:41:19]
_page : 475
_tape : Tape 65/2
CC:  Okay. Copied that, Fred. And our thermal people
     will be looking at it. One of the things we're
     talking about relative to the midcourse correction 
     is we'd like not to do it before the SHe tank
     goes, if it's going to go, just so it won't give
     us a problem reestablishing [glossary:PTC]. And right now
     our people think that the burst disk will pop
     around 106 hours.

[03:23:41:52]
LMP: Okay.

[03:23:44:27]
LMP: The L-shaped bag is ...

[03:23:46:33]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[03:23:46:39]
LMP: Go ahead.

[03:23:46:40]
CC:  Okay, Fred. Since you went ahead and used the
     [glossary:PLSS] condensate container, we got the procedure
     in for using it. I'm not going to read it up to
     you except that it cautions a little bit about
     shaking it too much or about filling it too full,
     because they feel that if you do that the vent
     valve might unseat and the bag might leak a little
     bit. Over.

[03:23:47:10]
LMP: Okay. We haven't removed it from its stowage
     spot. We just left it right in place, and just -
     he mated the tank at the end of the cable and
     hooked right into that.

[03:23:47:25]
CC:  Understand. That's satisfactory and recommended
     that you leave it in the stowage spot. That
     should help the situation.

[03:23:47:37]
LMP: Roger.

[03:23:48:27]
LMP: We got a - we got another flow shower going on
     outside. Particles, seeing them vented against
     the service module. Jack thinks it may be an
     H<sub>2</sub> vent. ...

[03:23:48:41]
CC:  Okay. Copy that. What window are you looking
     at it out of, Fred?

[03:23:48:48]
LMP: Out the [glossary:LM] docking window.

[03:23:48:50]
CC:  The docking window. Roger that. Somebody just
     handed me your latest consumables status report,
     and you're using between 11 to 12 amps an hour
     real steady, and it looks real good.

[04:00:20:45]
CMP: Joe, what are you showing for [glossary:GET] now?

[04:00:20:50]
CC:  I think you wanted the [glossary:GET], Jack, and the present
     [glossary:GET] is 96 hours 21 minutes. Over.

[04:00:21:01]
CMP: Okay, thank you.

[04:00:21:03]
CC:  Okay.

[04:00:21:16]
CC:  And Jack, Houston. For your information, [glossary:FIDO]
     tells me that we are in the Earth's sphere of
     influence and we're starting to accelerate.

[04:00:21:29]
CMP: I thought it was about time we crossed. Thank
     you.

[04:00:21:33]
CC: Roger.

[04:00:21:39]
CMP: We're on our way back home.

[04:00:21:49]
CMP: There's something that puzzles me, Joe. Vance
     mentioned yesterday that the planned entry is a
     [glossary:CMC]-guided entry, so I'm kind of curious as how
     are we going to get the alinement.

[04:00:22:09]
CC:  Did you say how we're going to get guidance?
     Over.

[04:00:22:14]
CMP: No. How are we going to get a platform alinement?

[04:00:22:18]
CC:  Okay. We got a number of interesting ideas on
     that and the latest one I've heard is to power
     up the [glossary:LM] platform and aline it, and aline the CM
     platform to it.

[04:00:22:32]
CMP: Okay. That sounds good.

[04:00:22:34]
CC:  Okay. And we're working out detailed procedures
     on that, Jack.

[04:00:22:39]
CMP: Okay.

[04:00:37:01]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[04:00:37:06]
CMP: Go ahead, Joe.

[04:00:37:07]
CC:  Okay. We are taking our final look at the 
     mid-course procedures and we have a question as to the
     present position of one of the switches. The
     switch is the [glossary:AGS] STATUS switch on panel 6. We'd
     just like to know where it's at.

[04:00:37:27]
_page : 477
_tape : Tape 65/4
CMP: Okay. Stand by.

[04:00:37:44]

CC: Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.

[04:01:14:42]
SC: Okay, Vance. I just heard a little thump,
     sounded like down in the descent stage, and I
     saw a new shower of snow flakes come up that
     looked like they were emitted from down that way.
     We've already decided though - I wonder what the
     SUPERCRIT pressure looked like now.

[04:01:15:02]
CC: Okay. Understand you saw a thump in the descent
     stage and a few snow flakes. We'll take a look
     down here, see if we see anything.

[04:01:15:46]
CC: Aquarius, Houston.

[04:01:16:06]
CC: Aquarius, Houston.

[04:01:16:10]
LMP: Go ahead.

[04:01:16:12]
CC:  Fred, we don't see anything wrong. For example,
     your SHe appears to be okay as far as we can see.
     The thing we don't have data on, is the ...
     tank down there.

[04:01:16:30]
LMP: Okay. And I doubt if it would have been that
     anyway.

[04:01:16:35]
CC:  Okay. While we have you on the horn - -

[04:01:16:37]
LMP: We're still getting -

[04:01:16:42]
CC:  Roger. Still getting it.

[04:01:16:43]
LMP: Go ahead.

[04:01:16:45]
CC:  While you're on the horn, be advised our calculations 
     show you might be running out of potable
     water in the [glossary:CSM] pretty soon. Also, that you
     might start to have hydrogen tank venting in
     the [glossary:CSM] and a question. Next time Jack looks
     through the sextant and telescope, we'd like him
     to see how it looks. Do you have anything on
     the optics, any specks or anything?

[04:01:17:20]
LMP: Okay, ...

[04:01:20:05]
_page : 479
_tape : Tape 66/2
LMP: Houston, Aquarius. How do you read?

[04:01:20:09]
CC: Aquarius, we read you 4 by 4. Go ahead.

[04:01:20:15]
LMP: Okay. It looks like the [glossary:PTC] is deteriorated
     enough that ... the docking window of the [glossary:LM],
     and ...

[04:01:20:55]
CC: Aquarius, Houston. We got part of your transmission. 
     Understand the [glossary:PTC] has deteriorated
     quite a bit and you'd like to know what to do
     about it. Is that affirm?

[04:01:21:10]
LMP: Negative. How do you read now, Vance?

[04:01:21:12]
CC:  Okay. A little better.

[04:01:21:16]
LMP: Okay. The only comment was that it has 
     deteriorated to where the Moon is now coming through
     the overhead docking window now, in a portion
     of each pass, and about that time I just lose
     COMM on either antenna, so there's going to be
     a short period of time on each revolution where
     we're not going to have COMM.

[04:01:21:38]
CC:  Okay, Fred. We understand that and one more
     item for clarification on the water. We don't
     really know what your usage of potable is. That
     was purely an estimate assuming a fairly healthy
     usage.

[04:01:21:57]
LMP: Okay.

[04:01:24:14]
LMP: Hey, Houston; Aquarius.

[04:01:24:20]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.

[04:01:24:25]
LMP: Okay. Jack just took a look through the optics
     - through one REV, and he said they look good,
     loud and clear. He doesn't have any current
     condensate on either the sextant or telescope.

[04:01:24:40]
CC:  Okay, Fred. Thanks for the info.

[04:01:36:07]
LMP: How do you read, Vance?

[04:01:36:11]
CC:  Okay. I'm reading you weakly, Fred. Go ahead.

LMP: With all this other procedures you've been
     working on there, I thought I was going to
     have a new one for you. How to get four gingerbread 
     cubes apart; I think they were stuck
     together with epoxy.

[04:01:36:53]
CC:  This is in the food bag?

[04:01:36:59]
LMP: Yes.

[04:01:37:01]
CC:  That's to stand loads of launch and boost.

[04:01:37:07]
LMP: Roger. Tool B did the trick.

[04:01:37:28]
LMP: Yes.

[04:01:37:34]
CC: Hey, Fred. John says you can use the dikes on
     it to get them apart.

[04:01:37:42]
LMP: Yes, that probably wouldn't have crumbled them
     as badly.

[04:01:37:49]
LMP: I generally don't use the subtle approach. You
     can tell we're feeling pretty good, Vance, when
     we start complaining about the food.

[04:01:37:58]
CC:  Yes. That's good to hear.

[04:01:38:11]

CC: Go ahead, Fred.

[04:02:26:23]
LMP: Okay. Jim's coming back on the line, and I'll
     be unhooking on the BIOMEDs, and you want us
     to go back to the SPA DOWN VOICE BACKUP?

[04:02:26:44]
CC:  Stand by.

[04:02:26:48]
LMP: Okay. Jim doesn't have his BIOMED rigged on
     right now, so ... DOWN VOICE ...

[04:02:27:07]
CC:  Okay, Fred. You're too weak on that last. I
     understand you're disconnecting, and your BIOMED
     will be off. Say again about Jim, please.

[04:02:27:24]
LMP: Okay. How do you read now?

[04:02:27:26]
CC:  Okay.

[04:02:27:30]
LMP: Okay. All I said was Jim doesn't have his
     BIOMED rigged right now so I'll go back to
     DOWN VOICE BACKUP SPA and Jim's coming on the
     line.

[04:02:27:49]
CC:  Okay. We copy you're in DOWN VOICE BACKUP.

     We've lost our suit compressors.

[04:02:29:02]
CDR: Because we don't want to use the power.

[04:02:29:18]

[04:02:30:06]
CC:  Right. We thought maybe it was morning to you.

[04:02:30:12]
CDR: Well, I've sort of lost track. But I had a
     good sleep.

[04:02:30:17]
CC:  Glad to hear it. Doctor just said he wondered
     how many hours?

[04:02:30:29]
CDR: Oh, let's say whenever I left Jack, and Fred
     came up and we ate for about an hour, and then
     I went to bed, so whatever that time was. It
     must be about 5 hours, something like that;
     4 or 5 hours.

[04:02:30:42]

     module venting has ceased, at least momentarily.

[04:02:34:19]

     Was it venting? Anything else going on? Any
     more venting?

[04:02:34:51]
LMP: No.

[04:02:34:52]
CDR: No. Fred hasn't seen anything else from the
     descent stage. And I understand that we can
     expect the - the SHe - tank pressure to build up
     to relief here about 105 hours.

[04:02:35:06]
CC:  Roger. A little later than that - like 106 -
     107.

[04:02:35:13]
CDR: Okay.

[04:02:35:43]
CDR: Did you get some interior photos?

[04:02:35:48]
LMP: Yes.

[04:02:35:52]
CDR: Okay. I'd like to show them the arrangement of
     these hydroxide canisters. Do you have?

[04:02:36:10]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[04:02:37:11]
_page : 484
_tape : Tape 67/2
CDR: Did they give Jack any more procedures on command
     module powerup?

[04:02:37:16]
LMP: ...

[04:02:37:18]
CDR: Did they give Jack any more procedures on command module powerup?

[04:02:39:04]
CDR: Well, they think it might be up here.

[04:02:39:06]
LMP: Okay.

[04:02:39:08]
CDR: The main thing we got to think about, and when
     we have to get to them, is the procedures for [glossary:LM] 
     jettison, the transfer of the [glossary:LM] to [glossary:CSM] mode
     (cough), [glossary:LM] jettison.

[04:02:39:23]
LMP: ...

[04:02:39:24]
CDR: Yes.

[04:02:40:33]
CDR: ... the [glossary:LM] mode?

[04:02:41:17]
LMP: All we have to do is turn the BIOMED ... on, and
     we'll be in there.

[04:02:41:34]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[04:02:41:39]
CC:  Roger. Go ahead, Aquarius.

[04:02:41:44]
CDR: We would like permission to turn the BIOMED on to
     get off the hot mike mode. I don't think that we
     have to be on it now if you have the big dish on,
     do you?

[04:02:42:05]
LMP: Yes. Yaw's coming - or roll's coming up for it,
     and we were going to burn.

[04:02:42:13]
CC:  Roger, Jim. We concur. Go ahead and turn it on.

[04:02:42:18]
CDR: Okay. Fine; thank you.

[04:02:42:22]
CC:  One other point. The philosophy of timing this
     midcourse is based a little bit on doing it just
     before the SHe tank is supposed to vent. That
     way, we hope that we would have - - be powered
     up and you would have control when the venting
     occurs, in case you were tossed around a little
     bit. Over.

[04:02:42:45]
_page : 485
_tape : Tape 67/3
CDR: Okay. Understand. Philosophy on the midcourse
     is doing it prior to venting of the SHe tank,
     which means we'll be doing this around 105 hours,
     I suppose, or [time:04:09:30:00|105:30] and so I'll have control of
     the spacecraft if it should give us some perturbation.

[04:02:43:06]
CC: Roger. Then, after that, we would establish
     [glossary:PTC] again.

[04:02:43:16]
CDR: Roger.

[04:02:48:01]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[04:02:48:05]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[04:02:48:09]
CDR: Our REPRESS package pressure is 820.

[04:02:48:14]
CC:  Okay. REPRESS pressure 820. Thank you.

[04:02:54:17]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[04:02:54:23]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[04:02:54:26]
CC:  Jim, could you switch your BIOMED switch to the
     position opposite to where it is now? We are
     getting a subcarrier, but no data. Over.

[04:02:54:45]
CDR: Now you know, Houston, I don't have BIOMED on.

[04:02:54:53]
CC:  Okay. And we have a small addition to the procedure 
     that was read up to you earlier, which
     involves power transfer from the [glossary:LM] to the [glossary:CSM].

[04:02:55:17]
CDR: Stand by 1.

[04:02:55:19]
CC:  Okay.

[04:02:55:59]
CDR: Okay, Houston. Go ahead.

[04:02:56:02]
CC:  Okay. At the end of the procedure, after the
     step BAT 5 and 6, OFF, add the following: circuit 
     breakers, panels - panels 11 and 16, ASCENT
     ECA CONTROL, both open. Over.

[04:02:56:37]
CDR: Okay. After the step BAT 5 and 6, OFF, step 3
     will be circuit breakers panels 11 and 16 ASCENT
     ECA CONTROL, both open.

[04:02:56:50]
CC:  That's correct, Jim. And this is to guard against
     a single-point failure that - a remote possibility
     that would preclude you from getting the batteries
     back on.

[04:02:57:04]
_page : 486
_tape : Tape 67/4
CDR: Roger.

[04:02:58:20]
CC:  Go ahead.

[04:03:49:43]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[04:03:49:47]
CC:  Go ahead, Jim.

[04:03:49:52]
CDR: Okay. We just had a battery warning ... Battery 2.

[04:03:50:07]
CC:  Stand by, Jim. The COMM's no good here right
     now.

[04:03:50:20]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius. How do you read now?

[04:03:50:23]
CC:  Go ahead. Loud and clear.

[04:03:50:26]
CDR: Okay. We just had a battery warning MASTER ALARM,
     and it looks like it's battery 2.

[04:03:50:38]
CC:  Roger.

[04:03:50:48]
CC:  Roger, Houston - This is Houston. Could you
     close the POWER AMP circuit breaker, and we'll
     get some high bit rate?

[04:03:50:56]
CDR: Roger.

[04:03:51:08]
CDR: It's closed.

[04:03:51:09]
CC:  Okay. And we need high bit rate.

[04:03:51:49]
CDR: Are you picking it up, Houston?

[04:03:51:53]
CC:  Roger. And we want to open the BAL LOAD CROSS
     TIE on panel 16. Over.

[04:03:52:00]
CDR: Say again.

[04:03:52:01]
CC:  Open the BAL LOAD CROSS TIE breaker on panel 16.
     Over.

[04:03:52:08]
CDR: Open BALANCE LOAD CROSS TIE breaker on 16.
     Roger.

[04:03:52:11]
CC:  That's affirm.

[04:03:52:13]
CDR: It's open.

[04:03:53:12]
CDR: If you're getting high bit data, we could do an
     OFF/RESET and go back on on battery 2. We're
     standing by for that.

[04:03:53:29]
_page : 487
_tape : Tape 67/5
CC:  Okay. Could you turn off battery 2, and leave
     it off and let us look at it?

[04:03:53:36]
CDR: Say again. You want us to turn off battery 2,
     and leave it off until you look at it?

[04:03:53:39]
CC:  That's affirmative.

[04:03:53:42]
CDR: Okay. Battery 2 coming off the line.

[04:03:54:27]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. So you want to stay in this
     configuration for awhile, and let's look at the
     battery.

[04:03:54:34]
CDR: Roger. We'll stay in this configuration.

[04:03:54:41]
CC:  Want to close the BAL LOADS circuit breaker
     back now.

[04:03:55:00]
CC:  13, Houston. We want to close the BAL LOADS
     circuit breaker on panel 16 now, again.

[04:03:55:08]
CDR: We have it closed; the closed - BALANCE LOADS
     circuit breaker is closed.

[04:03:55:13]
CC:  Roger.

[04:03:55:41]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Request RANGE FUNCTIONS
     switch to RANGE ...

[04:03:55:49]
CDR: All right. RANGE FUNCTIONS switch going to
     RANGE.

[04:03:55:53]
CC:  Right-o.

[04:03:57:33]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[04:03:57:49]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[04:03:57:54]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[04:03:57:56]
CC:  Jim, on the battery problem, we have determined
     that it is not overcurrent or reverse current.
     We suspect it's over-temp, but don't know for
     sure, so we're going to watch it for awhile.

[04:03:58:12]
CDR: Okay.

[04:04:00:20]
CC: Aquarius, Houston.

[04:04:00:25]
_page : 488
_tape : Tape 67/6
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[04:04:00:27]
CC:  Jim, Charlie has some procedures to read up for
     you here; I think you'll need your activation
     checklist, if it's handy.

[04:04:00:38]
CC: Aquarius, that's the contingency checklist.

[04:04:00:40]
CDR: Okay. I'll just - Okay. Stand by, Charlie.

[04:04:01:12]
CDR: Okay, Charlie. I've got the contingency checklist, 
     and standing by.

[04:04:01:16]
CC: Okay, Jim. We'd like you to turn to page -
     page 24, which is the "30-Minute Activation,"
     and this is going to be a procedure for the mid-course 
     burn that we got coming up at 105 with
     the [glossary:AGS] up. Over.

[04:04:01:36]
CDR: Roger. On the midcourse at 105, and I'm on
     page 24.

[04:04:01:41]
CC:  Okay; "30-Minute Activation," omit steps 1, 2,
     and 3; perform step 4, "[glossary:RCS] system A/B-2." Over.

[04:04:01:58]
CDR: Roger. Omit steps 1, 2, and 3; perform step 4.

[04:04:02:03]
CC:  Roger. And on the "[glossary:EPS] Activation," same page,
     perform step 1; and in step 2, perform line number 
     - line number 6, "[glossary:EPS] DISPLAY-CLOSE." Over.

[04:04:02:28]
CDR: Okay. On "[glossary:EPS] Activation," perform step 1, and
     perform step 2, line 6 only; is that correct?

[04:04:02:37]
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim. The rest of the stuff
     is already closed at this time, so that's all
     we'll have to do is close the [glossary:EPS] DISPLAY breaker.

[04:04:02:57]
CDR: Okay.

[04:04:02:58]
CC:  All right. Turn to page 25. On page 25, omit
     step 3; perform step 4. On step 4, last line,
     scratch "CB(16) [glossary:EPS]: INVERTER 2, closed." Over.

[04:04:03:25]
CDR: Roger. Omit step 3; perform step 4, except for
     the last line. Circuit breaker 16, [glossary:EPS] INVERTER
     2, closed.

[04:04:03:34]
_extra : END OF TAPE
_page : 489
_tape : Tape 67/7
CC: Roger. That's correct. On step 5, perform
     step 5. Under "Primary Glycol Loop Activation,"
     step 1, line 1, "CB(16) [glossary:ECS]: DISPLAY - CLOSE."
     That's a crew option; you can have it if you
     want to. Omit the rest of step 1 and step 2.
     Perform step 3. Over.

[04:04:04:11]
_page : 490
_tape : Tape 68/1
CDR: Okay. On primary glycol loop activation, crew
     option on step 1, first line; the rest of it
     we'll omit. Step 2, we'll omit, and we'll do
     step 3.

[04:04:04:27]
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim, with the following
     DELTAs on step 3, and if you'll turn to page 26,
     I'll give you the DELTAs on the activation circuit 
     breaker list. Over.

[04:04:04:43]
CDR: Okay. I'm there.

[04:04:04:45]
CC:  Roger. On line 1, correction, row 1, under AC
     BUS A: TAPE RECORDER should be open; DECA
     GIMBAL, open. All the other ones as shown on
     the page. Over.

[04:04:05:12]
CDR: Okay. On row 1, AC BUS A: TAPE RECORDER and
     DECA GIMBAL will be open. All the rest as shown.

[04:04:05:20]
CC: Roger. And we don't know the status of your
     windows. If you - During this burn, we're going
     to have to look out the forward window to get
     the alinement with the [glossary:COAS], so you might need
     the commander window heater and you can, of
     course, use that breaker if needed, since we do
     have the AC power. On row 2 - Go ahead. Over.

[04:04:05:46]
CDR: I don't think we'll need it, Charlie.

[04:04:05:47]
CC:  Okay; fine, Jim. On row 2, under [glossary:RCS] SYSTEM A:
     ASCENT FEED 2 and ASCENT FEED 1 should be open.
     Under FLIGHT DISPLAYS: MISSION TIMER should be
     open; GASTA, open; [glossary:ORDEAL], open. Under AC BUS A:
     GASTA, open. The rest are as shown on the page.
     Over.

[04:04:06:28]
CDR: Okay. On row 2, we're going to open up ASCENT
     FEED 2 and ASCENT FEED 1 under [glossary:RCS] SYSTEM A.
     We're going to open up the MISSION TIMER, and
     FLIGHT DISPLAYS: the GASTA and the [glossary:ORDEAL]; and
     the AC BUS A: the GASTA.

[04:04:06:46]
CC:  That's affirmative. Okay. Row 3, under PROPELLANT: 
     DESCENT HELIUM REG/VENT should be open.
     Under HEATERS: RENDEZVOUS RADAR STANDBY, open;
     LANDING RADAR, open. Under STAB/CONTROL: ATCA
     (PGNS), open. Under ED and LIGHTING: all four
     open. Over.

[04:04:07:35]
_page : 491
_tape : Tape 68/2
CDR: Okay. Row 3, under PROPELLANT - propulsion:
     the DESCENT HELIUM REG/VENT will be open: the
     STANDBY RENDEZVOUS HEATER will be open and the
     LANDING RADAR HEATER circuit breaker will be
     open. I just changed antennas; and, keeping on
     down the line, ATCA [glossary:PGNS] will be open and the
     last four circuit breakers, two under ED and
     two under LIGHTING, will be open.

[04:04:08:07]
CC:  That's affirmative. Okay. Under row 4, under
     [glossary:ECS]: GLYCOL PUMP AUTO TRANSFER, close. Under
     COMM: UP DATA LINK, open; VHF B and VHF A should
     be open. Under [glossary:PGNS]: [glossary:LGC]/[glossary:DSKY], open; [glossary:IMU]
     OPERATE, open. Over.

[04:04:08:50]
CDR: Okay. Under row 4, the AUTO TRANSFER will be
     close. UPDATA LINK, open; VHF A and B, open;
     [glossary:DSKY], open; and [glossary:IMU] OPERATE, open.

[04:04:09:09]
CC:  That's affirm. On the last row, the only DELTA
     is under the CROSS TIE BUS and it should be open.
     Over.

[04:04:09:20]
CDR: Say that again, Charlie.

[04:04:09:22]
CC:  Okay. Under the last row, under [glossary:EPS] is the only
     DELTA and that is under the CROSS TIE BUS. It
     should go open. Over.

[04:04:09:34]
CDR: Roger. The CROSS TIE BUS should go open.

[04:04:09:38]
CC:  That's affirm. Going on to page 27, Activation,
     panel 16. Under [glossary:RCS] SYSTEM Bravo: ASCENT FEED 1,
     ASCENT FEED 2 should be open. Under PROPULSION:
     PQGS should be open; ASCENT HELIUM REG, open.
     Over.

[04:04:10:12]
CDR: Okay. Line 1, on panel 16, ASCENT FEEDs 1 and 2
     will be open. And the PQGS will be open, and
     the ASCENT HELIUM REG will be open.

[04:04:10:24]
CC:  That's affirmative. On the next three rows, we
     only get the nine DELTAs, so I'll go through the
     next three rows completely and then you can read
     those back. Under LIGHTING - -

[04:04:10:36]
CDR: Okay.

[04:04:10:37]
CC:  Under LIGHTING; FLOOD, open; TRACK, open. Under
     ED LOGIC - Correction, under ED: LOGIC, open.
     Under STAB/CONTROL: DESCENT ENGINE OVERRIDE,
     open. Under [glossary:ECS]: SUIT FLOW CONTROL, open. Under
     row 3, COMM: DISPLAY, open; VHF A TRANSMITTER,
     open; VHF B RECEIVER, open. Under [glossary:ECS]: DISPLAY,
     that's crew option. Last row, under [glossary:EPS]: INVERTER
     2, open. Over.

[04:04:11:45]
_page : 492
_tape : Tape 68/3
CDR: Okay. On the last three rows, we have FLOOD and
     TRACK circuit breakers, row 2, open; LOGIC POWER B,
     open; DESCENT ENGINE OVERRIDE, open; SUIT FLOW
     CONTROL, open. On the third row - row, DISPLAY,
     open; VHF A and - VHF - VHF A TRANSMITTER, open;
     VHF B RECEIVER, open. And under [glossary:ECS]: we have
     DISPLAY, open, at crew option. And the last one,
     INVERTER 2 under [glossary:EPS], will be open.

[04:04:12:23]
CC:  Roger. That's a good readback. Under that [glossary:ECS]
     DISPLAY, it shows it closed. If, with it closed,
     you can have some readout of - onboard readout of
     your [glossary:ECS] system - draws a lot less than a half amp
     so it's up to you whether you want it or not.
     Okay, on page 28.

[04:04:12:42]
CDR: Roger.

[04:04:12:44]
CC:  On page 28, step - perform step 4 with the following 
     changes in the warning light status.
     Under the warning lights, you will probably -
     you will have ASCENT PRESSURE and an [glossary:LGC] light.
     Scratch "[glossary:RCS] A and [glossary:RCS] B REG." Under caution
     lights, you'll have a PRE AMPS light. Over.

[04:04:13:20]
CDR: Roger. Under warning, we'll have ASCENT PRESSURE
     and [glossary:LGC]; and under caution, we'll have a PRE AMP.

[04:04:13:27]
CC:  Affirmative. Under "VHF/S-band Activation and
     Checkout," scratch step 1. Under step 2, change
     "DOWN VOICE BACKUP" to VOICE. Scratch step 3.
     Under "[glossary:PGNS] turn on," scratch entire procedure.
     Under "[glossary:DAP] Set/Gimbal Drive," scratch entire procedure. 
     Over.

[04:04:14:13]
CDR: Okay. Under "VHF/S-band Activation and Checkout,"
     scratch step 1. Do step 2 with the following
     change, "DOWN VOICE BACKUP" to "VOICE." Scratch
     step 3. Scratch the entire remaining events that
     page. Over.

[04:04:14:32]
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim, Going on to page 29.
     We've got - At this point, there's a write-in
     required. It's about a six or seven liner, and
     I'll try to go fairly slowly and let you write
     it down, if you're ready to copy. Over.

[04:04:15:03]
_page : 493
_tape : Tape 68/4
CDR: Ready to copy.

[04:04:15:05]
CC:  Okay. At this point, we'd like you to "Verify [glossary:RCS]
     heaters in AUTO for 15 minutes."

[04:04:15:19]
CDR: Is that the first step, Charlie?

[04:04:15:20]
CC:  That's affirmative. What we're trying to do here
     is we're getting you set up in an attitude so you
     can damp your rates and come out of [glossary:PTC]. And
     this is the configuration I'm reading you now,
     the next - in the next six lines, the procedure
     for getting you into a configuration to damp the
     rates and stop [glossary:PTC]. Over.

[04:04:15:43]
CDR: Okay. So the first thing will be to - "Go to
     AUTO on the [glossary:RCS] SYSTEM A and B"?

[04:04:15:50]
CC:  It's the "Verify that the heaters have been in
     AUTO for 15 minutes." Back on the first page of
     this procedure, you put the heaters in AUTO and
     you pushed the breakers in, and we'd like for
     them to warm up the quads for 15 minutes before
     we start to - stop at - stopping [glossary:PTC]. Over.

[04:04:16:12]
CDR: Roger, "Verify heaters [glossary:RCS] on for 15 minutes."

[04:04:16:16]
CC:  Okay. Step 2: "BALANCE COUPLE, OFF; DEAD BAND,
     MINIMUM; ATTITUDE CONTROL: PITCH and ROLL to
     PULSE; YAW to DIRECT; MODE CONTROL: [glossary:AGS], ATT
     HOLD; GUIDANCE CONTROL to ACS; damp rates; pitch
     and roll with the [glossary:TTCA], yaw with the ACA with the
     Earth in the front window." Over.

[04:04:17:45]
CDR: Okay, let's see if I got it. Step 2 is "BALANCE
     COUPLE's OFF; DEAD BAND, MIN; ATTITUDE CONTROL:
     PITCH and YAW at PULSE; YAW, DIRECT. MODE CONTROL 
     will be in [glossary:AGS], ATT HOLD; GUIDANCE CONTROL
     will be in [glossary:AGS]; we'll damp the rates; pitch and
     roll with the [glossary:TTCA], and yaw with the ACA; and
     we'll probably have to have some reference point,
     so I have to try and stop on the Earth." Over.

[04:04:18:14]
CC:  Roger, Jim. We were hoping that in your [glossary:PTC] that
     you occasionally see the Earth coming through the
     window; and, if that's true, then we'd like you
     to have to - just damp the rates with the Earth
     in the forward window. And then we'll give you
     the burn attitude via the forward window on the
     Earth momentarily. Over.

[04:04:18:44]
_page : 494
_tape : Tape 68/5
CDR: Roger.

[04:04:18:46]
CC: Okay. That was the entire procedure for damping
     the rates, only - though I only gave you - said
     it was step 2, that was the entire procedure.
     Now, continuing on to what's printed on page 29 -
     Correction, you had one error in the readback
     under ATTITUDE CONTROL. It was PITCH and ROLL to
     PULSE; YAW to DIRECT. Continuing on, on page 29
     with the printed procedure, the first four lines,
     scratch. Step 3, scratch. Under "[glossary:AGS] Activation,"
     one change: add a step. First step will be
     "Verify ASA CB(16) in for 10 minutes." The rest
     of the [glossary:AGS] activation is as printed. Over.

[04:04:20:02]
CDR: Okay. "Verify ASA circuit breaker 16 in for
     10 minutes"; and, I take it, 10 minutes back in
     our procedures we'll have a note saying to put
     that in.

[04:04:20:14]
CC: It's - the circuit breaker goes in on the 
     circuit breaker activation page, Jim. So, by the
     time we get here and have the rates all damped,
     we feel that - that the [glossary:PIPA]S will be up to
     temperature by this time, and we can go ahead
     and turn it - turn the [glossary:AGS] on at this time. Over.
     But we just want you to verify that.

[04:04:20:36]
CDR: Okay. And one other question, Charlie. I'd like
     to know if the note you gave me about damping the
     rates is before the other information on page 29.

[04:04:20:49]
CC:  That's affirmative. Add that in to the top of
     the page. The - What we're really doing - Let's
     - let's put it in to right before the "[glossary:AGS] Activation." 
     The other - the other procedure on the
     top of the page belongs with the "[glossary:DAP] Set Gimbal
     Trim," and we're just omitting all of that procedure. 
     So the addition that - on the damping,
     the rates should really go in right before the
     "[glossary:AGS] Activation." Over.

[04:04:21:20]
CDR: Understand.

[04:04:21:22]
CC:  What we're really trying to do is get you in a
     posture so that when you see the Earth come
     through the window, you can damp her out and hold -
     hold the Earth in the window. Proceeding on to
     the rest of page 29, under "[glossary:RCS] PRESS," scratch
     the entire three steps as printed. On page 30,
     scratch step 4 under the "[glossary:RCS] PRESS." Over.

[04:04:21:55]
_page : 495
_tape : Tape 68/6
CDR: Roger. Under "[glossary:AGS] Activation," well, I included
     that step on the ASA circuit breaker and we'll
     do step 1 and 2 under "[glossary:AGS] Activation." But
     then we'll scratch steps 1, 2, and 3 under "RCS
     PRESS" and, on page 30, we'll scratch step 4.

[04:04:22:12]
CC:  Affirm. Under "[glossary:DPS] PRESS," step 1, line 1,
     scratch. Line 4, "DESCENT HELIUM REG 1, talkback
     barber pole." Under step 2, scratch; step 3,
     scratch; "LANDING GEAR DEPLOY," scratch. Over.

[04:04:22:47]
CDR: Okay. Under "[glossary:DPS] PRESS," we'll scratch the first
     line and we'll have the "DESCENT HELIUM REG,
     talkback to barber pole." We'll scratch steps 2
     and 3, and we'll scratch the "LANDING GEAR DEPLOY."

[04:04:23:03]
CC:  Roger. Now we got, on the back of page 30, Jim,
     you've got a blank page in your checklist, or
     should have, and we'd like to add a procedure to
     get you to burn attitude. Over.

[04:04:23:20]
CDR: Okay. A procedure to get the burn attitude.

[04:04:23:24]
CC:  Okay. First statement is a statement: "Verify
     [glossary:AGS] in OPERATE for 5 minutes." Then we go to
     "[glossary:AGS] address 400 plus 5, then 400 plus zero.
     ATTITUDE CONTROL: PITCH and ROLL to PULSE; YAW,
     MODE CONTROL. Maneuver using [glossary:TTCA] pitch and roll."
     The computer is controlling yaw, but you can override 
     with ACA. You with me? Over.

[04:04:25:08]
CDR: Okay, Charlie. I'm with you so far.

[04:04:25:11]
CC:  Okay, Jim. "When in attitude, ACA out of detent
     to zero error needle. Then set EVENT TIMER," and
     we'll give you a countdown on that when you get
     to that step. Over.

[04:04:25:52]
CDR: Okay. "When in attitude, ACA out of detent to
     null needles, and set [glossary:DET]."

[04:04:25:58]
CC:  Roger. Now, that - the burn attitude will be
     coming up on a pad, but, basically, we're looking
     for a local horizontal retrograde burn, which
     means, using a [glossary:COAS], if you put the horizontal
     line on the [glossary:COAS] on the horns of the Earth and
     then roll to place the X-axis in the direction
     of the Sun, we'll - that will put us in both burn
     attitude; and you can check that via the Sun which
     will be in the [glossary:AOT] detent 2. Should lie right
     along the cursor at the top. We'll have some
     more words on that for you momentarily. Now,
     I'd like to go on to page 31 if you're ready.
     Over.

[04:04:27:01]
_page : 496
_tape : Tape 68/7
CDR: Okay. I figure I have a handle on the attitude,
     the way the Earth should look in the [glossary:COAS], and
     you're going to give me some words on what the
     Sun would look like in the [glossary:AOT]. Is that right?

[04:04:27:14]
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim. We haven't got a 
     picture of it yet. It's going to be in the top
     part of the [glossary:COAS] - Correction, top part of the
     [glossary:AOT] at the top of the - the top of detent 2 and
     the top part of the [glossary:AOT], and it should, in attitude, 
     if you're right on the Sun, should split
     the cursor, though that roll angle is not too
     critical; if we're in about 10 degrees, we'll be
     okay. We - but I think - we think you should be
     able to get it better than that. On page 31,
     under the "[glossary:DPS] Burn Technique," you can scratch
     the bottom part below the little diagram there
     since the gimbal is locked. Over.

[04:04:28:07]
CDR: Understand scratch the bottom part underneath
     the diagram because the gimbal is locked.

[04:04:28:12]
CC:  That's affirmative; and, since the gimbal was
     trimmed out at the big burn yesterday, we should
     be still through the c.g., and we'd like to make
     sure that Jack sits in the same place for this
     burn that he did yesterday. That way, we'll -
     you should have no trouble controlling attitude.
     Now I'm ready to go over to page 32. Over.

[04:04:28:42]
CDR: Okay. Let me see if I have that right, now. You
     want Jack to sit in the same attitude so that the
     gimbals are the same place so you don't have
     trouble controlling attitude. I got it.

[04:04:28:50]
CC:  Okay. Now on page 32, top of the page, first line,
     scratch "[glossary:VERB 76]." Third line, "MODE CONTROL:
     [glossary:AGS], ATT HOLD." At "Minus 6 minutes," scratch
     lines 1, 2, and at "Burn Attitude," scratch
     "[glossary:VERB 40] [glossary:NOUN 20]." Scratch lines 2, 3, and 4.
     Now at "Burn Attitude," we want you to do a
     "400 plus 5" and then a "VERB - a 400 plus zero."
     And we have a caution note at this point. Over.

[04:04:29:57]
CDR: Go ahead.

[04:04:29:59]
_page : 497
_tape : Tape 68/8
CC: Okay. The caution is after "400 plus zero":
     Do not go out of detent on ACA again." Over.

[04:04:30:33]
CDR: Okay. After the last "400 plus zero," "Do not
     go out of detent with ACA." Is that correct?

[04:04:30:38]
CC:  That's a Roger, Jim. What happens is, of course,
     we set - when you go out of detent, you reset the
     [glossary:AGS] error needles and you - and you lose your
     attitude reference. You establish a new attitude
     reference, and it might not be the burn attitude
     since, at this point, we're controlling attitude
     with the [glossary:TTCA]. Now, picking up with the "[glossary:VERB 37],
     ENTER," scratch. Scratch everything down to the
     "404 plus zero," and we want you to perform those
     [glossary:AGS] steps with 404 down through 470. Over.

[04:04:31:23]
CDR: Okay. We'll scratch everything down to "404 plus
     zero," and we'll perform those four steps.

[04:04:31:29]
CC:  Roger. Turning over to page 33. Minus 4 minutes.
     Okay. Moving down the page, it's about line 7, to
     "ENGINE GIMBAL": "ENGINE GIMBAL, OFF." Down to
     "MODE CONTROL," make that read "MODE CONTROL: [glossary:AGS],
     ATT HOLD," and then scratch "PROPELLANT QUANTITY
     MONITOR, DESCENT 1." Over.

[04:04:32:16]
CDR: Okay. At 4 minutes, "ENGINE GIMBAL" will be "OFF";
     "MODE CONTROL" will be to "[glossary:AGS], ATT HOLD"; 
     "PROPELLANT QUANTITY MONITOR, DESCENT 1," scratched.

[04:04:32:27]
CC:  Roger. Picking up at minus 1 minute, scratch
     "MASTER ARM, ON." Minus 35 seconds, scratch
     first two lines. At minus 10 seconds, change that
     to "Minus 9 seconds"; so, at "Minus 9 seconds,"
     it will be "Manual Ullage." At 2 seconds, scratch
     "[glossary:CMC] MODE, FREE," and scratch "ACA out of detent."
     At - after "IGNITION," at plus 1 second, 
     "Terminate Ullage." Are you with me? Over.

[04:04:33:36]
CDR: Okay. At 1 minute, "MASTER ARM," we scratch. At
     35 seconds, scratch the first two lines. "Manual
     Ullage" will start at 9 seconds; we're scratching
     the blocks at 02 seconds; and the line beneath
     that, at plus 1 second, we "Terminate Ullage."

[04:04:33:56]
CC:  That's affirm. Picking up at plus 5 seconds;
     scratch the rest of the page. "[glossary:TTCA], attitude
     control; and MASTER ARM, OFF." Over.

[04:04:34:14]
_page : 498
_tape : Tape 68/9
CDR: Scratch the remainder of the page.

[04:04:34:18]
CC:  Okay. Now, like to verify that under the 35 seconds, 
     minus 35 seconds, the only thing you have
     remaining is "ENGINE ARM to DESCENT." Over.

[04:04:34:30]
CDR: That's affirm. That's the only thing I have.

[04:04:34:32]
CC:  Okay. Turning to the next page and the last
     page, Jim, 34. Top of the page, "Monitor DELTA-V<sub>X</sub>
     via 470." Scratch next two lines, "When propellant
     quantity equals 37" and the "DESCENT HELIUM REG."
     Scratch "[glossary:TTCA] commander, reduce to 10 percent."
     Now we want you to add a line; "shut" - It's a
     shutdown criteria, "shutdown on burn time minus
     1 second." Over.

[04:04:35:35]
CDR: Okay, "The shutdown is on burn time minus 
     1 second." Let me give you an example. If we have a
     30-second burn, we're going to shut down at
     29 seconds. Is that correct?

[04:04:35:47]
CC:  That's affirmative. We'll give you the pad, be
     coming up here from [glossary:FIDO] in a couple of hours,
     I guess, when we stabilize out on our tracking.
     The reason for - If you're ready to copy out a
     couple of more steps, and then I'll explain the
     reason we want to shut down on this burn time
     minus 1 second. Picking up on "When DELTA-V<sub>X</sub> - -

[04:04:36:09]
CDR: Okay.

[04:04:36:10]
CC:  "- - When DELTA-V<sub>X</sub> equal to the final DELTA-V<sub>X</sub>,"
     scratch that line. Scratch "ATTITUDE CONTROL:
     YAW, to PULSE." Add - Correction, scratch "Damp
     excessive rates via [glossary:LM] Y, Z translation" and add
     at that point "Null" error needles. Trim address
     470 to 0.1 foot per second." Over.

[04:04:37:04]
CDR: Okay, going through. After the "Shutdown on burn
     time minus 1 second," we scratch the next line;
     and we scratch "ATTITUDE CONTROL: YAW, to PULSE";
     we scratch "Damp excessive rates via [glossary:LM] Y, Z
     translation"; we add the line "Null" error needles,
     trim - Null the error needles and trim address
     470 to - What was the value there, Charlie?

[04:04:37:30]
CC:  "0.1 foot per second." The reason we are shutting
     down on the burn time is, since the ASA breaker
     has been out for so long, we're not real 
     confident that our [glossary:AGS] [glossary:PIPA]s are going to be super-sharp.
     So we want to make sure that we just get a burn
     time - no overburn; so we're shutting down on
     burn time minus 1 second. And then that will
     allow us a plus-X translation to trim 470 if it
     looks okay. If we had an overburn, we'd be in - -

[04:04:38:09]
_page : 499
_tape : Tape 68/10
CDR: Okay.

[04:04:38:10]
CC:  - - if we had an overburn, we'd be impinging on
     our command module to try to trim it out, so
     that's our reasoning there. Over.

[04:04:38:20]
CDR: Okay. Understand.

[04:04:38:21]
CC:  Okay. Picking up in the middle of the page, that -
     a block "CMS resume attitude control," scratch.
     Scratch the next line; "PRO VERB 96." Scratch
     the third line; "PROPELLANT QUANTITY MONITOR,
     OFF." Over.

[04:04:38:43]
CDR: Okay. We'll scratch the blocks, and we'll scratch
     the "PRO VERB 96"; then we'll scratch "PROPELLANT
     QUANTITY MONITOR, OFF."

[04:04:38:51]
CC:  Roger. Now, at the bottom of that page, I have
     a procedure for you to reestablish [glossary:PTC]. Over.

[04:04:39:30]
CDR: To reestablish [glossary:PTC]. Go ahead.

[04:04:39:33]
CC:  Okay. First line, "ATTITUDE CONTROL, three to
     PULSE"; line 2, "Roll with the [glossary:TTCA] until attitude
     is roll, plus or minus 90; pitch, 0; yaw, 0."
     Over.

[04:04:40:39]
CDR: Okay. Step 1, "ATTITUDE CONTROL, three to PULSE";
     2, "Roll with the [glossary:TTCA] ... pitch is 0 and yaw is
     0," and I think that will be on the [glossary:AGS] ball.

[04:04:40:56]
CC:  That's affirmative. You broke up there for a
     minute, Jim. We'll do that on the [glossary:AGS] ball from
     the burn attitude. We just want you to roll either
     way 90 degrees, keep pitch 0 and yaw 0. Now,
     step 3; "When at - when at attitude, ACA out of
     detent." Step 4; "ATTITUDE CONTROL: YAW, to MODE
     CONTROL. When rates are less than 0.05, ATTITUDE
     CONTROL: YAW, to PULSE."

[04:04:41:52]
CDR: Okay, Charlie. Can you hold up here a second?
     I lost you.

[04:04:41:55]
CC:  Roger.

[04:04:42:00]
_page : 500
_tape : Tape 68/11
CDR: Start with step 3 again. "When attitude - When
     at attitude, ACA out of detent."

[04:04:42:09]
CC:  That's Roger. Next step, step 4: "ATTITUDE
     CONTROL to YAW" - Correction, "ATTITUDE CONTROL:
     YAW, to MODE CONTROL." Over.

[04:04:42:33]
CDR: Okay. Step 4 is "ATTITUDE CONTROL: YAW, to
     MODE CONTROL."

[04:04:42:37]
CC:  Roger. Step 5: "When rates are less than
     0.05 degrees per second, ATTITUDE CONTROL: YAW,
     to PULSE."

[04:04:43:08]
CDR: Okay. "When rates are less than 0.05 degrees
     per second, ATTITUDE CONTROL: YAW, to PULSE."

[04:04:43:16]
CC:  Roger. Step 6: "Spin up to 0.3 degree per 
     second in yaw," and that takes about 21 pulses.
     Step 7 - Yes.

[04:04:43:49]
CDR: Okay. Go ahead.

[04:04:43:51]
CC:  Okay. Step 7: "MODE CONTROL, [glossary:AGS], OFF."

[04:04:44:09]
CDR: Okay. Step 6 was "Spin up to 0.3 degrees per
     second in yaw"; that's about 21 pulses. Step 7
     was "MODE CONTROL, [glossary:AGS], to OFF."

[04:04:44:19]
CC: That's affirm. Step 8: "Power down per power" -
     Correction, "Power down per contingency checklist
     page Power 5." Over.

[04:04:44:46]
CDR: Okay. And step 8 is Power down per contingency
     checklist Power 5," and I take it that's been
     revamped considering our situation. Okay.

[04:04:44:56]
CC:  That's affirmative, Jim. That's the one we gave
     you last night after the big burn, and we'll use
     that one as modified by - by us. This - we tried
     this [glossary:PTC] under [glossary:AGS] in the simulator and, of course,
     no slosh or anything, but it seemed to work pretty
     good by nulling the rates using the [glossary:TTCA] in pitch
     and roll and letting the ACS do it in yaw. You
     null the rates by looking at the error needles and
     just watching those, and when they don't - when
     they stop moving, then you got it within the limits
     of what we want. Over.

[04:04:45:40]
_page : 501
_tape : Tape 68/12
CDR: Okay. And I guess, Charlie, you have no - Do
     you have a ATT hold mode in pitch and roll at
     all in this configuration we're in, or do we
     have to use the [glossary:TTCA]?

[04:04:45:52]
CC:  We feel like we have to use the [glossary:TTCA]. The [glossary:AGS]
     gains are not too good in pitch and roll in this
     configuration. It'll hold it in yaw but it won't
     in pitch and roll. Over.

[04:04:46:07]
CDR: Okay.

[04:04:46:09]
CC:  And you'll have - During the burn, of course,
     you'll be controlling pitch and roll via the
     error needles with the [glossary:TTCA] also, and it's the
     little scheme that we've practiced in some of
     the SIMs. Over.

[04:04:46:28]
CDR: Right. Understand.

[04:04:46:37]
CDR: And, Houston, want to make sure that we allow
     enough time to get to the proper attitude for
     the burn so that we can be sure we establish
     the proper attitude and don't have to rush the
     burn.

[04:04:46:51]
CC:  Roger, Jim. We -we're looking right now,
     tentatively, at starting this about 45 minutes
     before the burn and our sensitivity is - not
     too bad on this burn. We can go 30 minutes
     either way and not affect our DELTA-V. Over.

[04:04:47:11]
CDR: Okay. Fine. And do you have a handle on just
     how long the burn will be? In time?

[04:04:47:17]
CC: It's looking like at about 7.8 seconds and about
     15 - Correction, 7.8 feet per second and about
     15 seconds. Over.

[04:04:47:30]
CDR: In about 18 seconds?

[04:04:47:32]
CC:  Negative. 15. 1 5.

[04:04:47:37]
CDR: 1 5. Okay.

[04:04:47:39]
CC:  And one other point is that we'd like to remind
     you that this is going to be in blowdown and
     both REGs B closed but we've got plenty at the
     10 percent.

[04:04:47:54]
CDR: Understand.

[04:04:47:57]
_page : 502
_tape : Tape 68/13
CC: And, Jim, in the simulator with our configuration
     that we had here, the thing is real stable at
     10 percent, so we don't think you'll have to
     tweak very much at all using the [glossary:TTCA|TTCAs]. Over.

[04:04:48:11]
CDR: Okay. Understand.

[04:04:48:14]
CC:  And I'll give you back to Vance. Thank you.

[04:04:48:20]
CDR: And thank you.

[04:04:50:08]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[04:04:50:13]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[04:04:50:15]
CC:  Jim, regarding your number 2 battery, we think
     that it's probably a sensor failure, a temperature
     sensor failure that's caused this alarm, rather
     than an actual overtemp of the battery; the reason 
     being that we haven't seen any higher 
     temperatures in the glycol loop. We expect to put the
     battery back on about 101 hours. That'll be about
     10 minutes, and then we'll look at it some more
     there. Over.

[04:04:50:49]
CDR: Okay. Concerning number 2 battery, you think it
     might be a sensor failure because you haven't
     seen any changes, and you're going to put the
     battery back on the line in about 10 minutes.

[04:04:50:58]
CC:  That's affirm.

[04:04:51:02]
CDR: Okay.

[04:04:58:47]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[04:04:58:51]
CC:  Go ahead, Jim.

[04:04:58:55]
CDR: For information, Vance, about a half hour ago, I
     guess, Jack and I couldn't see constellations at
     certain spacecraft attitudes, stars. We could
     see the - Scorpio and Sagittarius and we could
     see Altair or Acrux and Alpha Centuri, Vega,
     stars of that magnitude, and our venting has
     stopped which allows us now to differentiate between the 
     particles and the stars.

[04:04:59:28]
CC:  Roger; copy. Understand you can see the stars
     pretty well. Were you, at that time, in an
     attitude facing away from the Sun? I presume
     this is very attitude critical.

[04:04:59:44]
_page : 503
_tape : Tape 68/14
CDR: Yes. It is somewhat, Vance. If we have the Sun
     shining off the quads, it sort of ruins our 
     vision; and also, if the Earth or the Moon are in
     the general field of view, we can't see anything.

[04:04:59:58]
CC:  Okay. Thank you.

[04:05:01:40]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[04:05:01:46]
CDR: Go ahead, Vance.

[04:05:01:48]
CC:  Jim, we're ready to put that battery back on the
     line. Request you open the CROSS TIE BAL LOAD
     circuit breaker, panel 16, and then put back -
     BAT 2 back on the line.

[04:05:02:05]
CDR: Okay. First of all, we'll open the BALANCE CROSS
     TIE breaker on panel 16.

[04:05:02:12]
CC:  That's affirm.

[04:05:02:27]
CDR: Okay. The CROSS TIE BALANCE LOAD circuit breakers
     is in now, Vance. Now you want us to put battery 2 back on. Is that affirm?

[04:05:02:34]
CC:  Did you say it was in, or did you pull it out?

[04:05:02:39]
CDR: No. It's in; do you want it out?

[04:05:02:42]
CC:  That's affirm. We'd like it out, and then BAT 2
     on the line.

[04:05:02:47]
CDR: Okay. Coming up. BAT 2 is on the line. We have
     a MASTER ALARM and a BATTERY light.

[04:05:03:02]
CC:  Copy. And - and we think that's probably an 
     indication of the sensor problem, but stand by.

[04:05:05:02]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[04:05:05:07]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[04:05:05:09]
CC:  Jim, it looks to us like your battery is good,
     that this is in fact a sensor problem; therefore,
     request you close the CROSS TIE BAL LOADs on -
     circuit breaker on panel 16. Advise - -

[04:05:05:26]
CDR: Okay.

[04:05:05:27]
CC:  - - advise that you will not have any malfunction
     indication on any of your batteries now, but we
     can watch it from the ground. Over.

[04:05:05:39]
_page : 504
_tape : Tape 68/15
CDR: Okay. We'll close the CROSS TIE BALANCE LOAD
     circuit breaker at this time.

[04:05:05:47]
CC:  Roger. Copy.

[04:05:05:49]
CDR: That's closed, and we don't have any warning on
     any of the batteries, but you can monitor from
     the ground.

[04:05:05:55]
CC:  That's affirm.

[04:05:06:03]
CC:  And, Jim, we have a lengthy procedure here for
     powering up the [glossary:CSM] and turning on instrumentation
     so we can check the TM, and this will take a
     large piece of scratch paper whenever you're
     ready to copy.

[04:05:06:22]
CDR: This is to power up the [glossary:CSM]?

[04:05:06:24]
CC: That's affirm.

[04:05:06:27]
CDR: Okay. I'll tell you what, I'll have Jack get
     configured. He can copy that down and I'll have
     him - we'll get the stuff. Stand by.

[04:05:06:33]
CC:  Okay.

[04:05:07:35]
CMP: Okay, Vance, how do you read the Aquarius?

[04:05:07:39]
CC:  Okay, read you loud and clear, Aquarius. Is it
     cool in there now?

[04:05:07:44]
CMP: Okay. Yes, it's pretty cool. This is the third
     officer on this [glossary:LM] crew here. Ready to copy.

[04:05:07:55]
CC:  Okay. Jack, this is a lengthy procedure, take
     probably two or three pages. It assumes that
     you are in your nominal configuration, which was
     sent up - or in your day-flying configuration,
     which was sent up to you earlier today.

[04:05:08:15]
CMP: Okay. I can verify that we are in that
     configuration with the exception of panel 382, the
     water accumulator, which I've left off in case
     we wanted to get some more drinking water out of
     the command module, and I'll put those in the
     proper configuration before we do anything.

[04:05:08:38]
CC:  Okay. Ready to copy?

[04:05:08:43]
CMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[04:05:08:45]
_page : 505
_tape : Tape 68/16
CC:  Okay. Panel 4: TELCOMM, GROUP 1, to AC1.
     Panel 5: close the following circuit breakers:
     [glossary:ECS], PRESS GROUP 1, MAIN B; [glossary:ECS], PRESS GROUP 2,
     MAIN B; [glossary:ECS], TEMP, MAIN B; [glossary:ECS], SECONDARY LOOP
     TRANSDUCER, MAIN B; [glossary:ECS] RAD, CONTROL/HEATERS,
     MAIN B; BAT RELAY BUS, BAT B; BAT CHARGER, BAT B,
     CHARGE - or to B, CHARGE; INVERTER CONTROL, 2;
     INVERTER CONTROL, 1; [glossary:EPS] SENSOR SIGNAL, AC1; [glossary:EPS]
     SENSOR SIGNAL MAIN B; [glossary:EPS] SENSOR UNIT, AC BUS 1;
     WASTE/POTABLE WATER, MAIN B; INSTRUMENTS, ESS,
     MAIN B; that's ESSENTIAL, MAIN B. Are you with
     me?

[04:05:11:32]
CMP: Okay, Vance. Are you with me?

[04:05:11:34]
CC:  Roger. Why don't you read that group back, and
     then we'll proceed on.

[04:05:11:39]
CMP: Okay, sounds good. Because I don't know where I -
     how far I lost you. Okay, panel 4; TELCOMM,
     GROUP 1, to AC1. On panel 5, close the following
     circuit breakers: [glossary:ECS], PRESSURE GROUP 1, MAIN B;
     [glossary:ECS], PRESSURE GROUP 2, MAIN B; [glossary:ECS], TEMP, MAIN B;
     [glossary:ECS], SECONDARY LOOP TRANSDUCER, MAIN B; [glossary:ECS] RAD,
     CONTROL/HEATERS, MAIN B; BAT RELAY BUS, BAT B;
     BAT CHARGER, BAT B; INVERTER CONTROL, 2; INVERTER
     CONTROL, 1; [glossary:EPS] SENSOR SIGNAL, AC1; [glossary:EPS] SENSOR
     SIGNAL, MAIN B; [glossary:EPS] SENSOR UNIT, AC1; WASTE/POTABLE
     H<sub>2</sub>O, MAIN B; INSTRUMENTATION, ESSENTIAL,
     MAIN B.

[04:05:12:41]
CC:  Okay; That's all correct. Is that reading rate
     okay for you?

[04:05:12:48]
CMP: Yes, that's fine.

[04:05:12:50]
CC:  Okay, and leave a little space if you can to the
     right of these because when we talk about the
     backup procedure, why then we can just use the
     same listing, and I'll - I'll tell you open 
     instead of close these circuit breakers, or at
     least most of them. Over.

[04:05:13:12]
CMP: Okay.

[04:05:13:14]
CC:  Okay. Next, panel 3: TRANSPONDER, PRIMARY;
     POWER AMPL, to PRIMARY, that's a verify; POWER
     AMPL, HIGH; MODE, VOICE, to OFF; POWER, [glossary:SCE], to
     NORMAL; PMP to NORMAL; S-BAND ANTENNA, OMNI D,
     that's Delta. Okay, why don't you read that
     one back?

[04:05:14:16]
_page : 506
_tape : Tape 68/17
CMP: Okay. On panel 3: TRANSPONDER to PRIMARY;
     POWER AMPLIFIER to PRIMARY; POWER AMPL, HIGH;
     MODE, VOICE, to OFF; POWER, [glossary:SCE], to NORMAL; PMP
     to NORMAL; S-BAND ANTENNA, OMNI D, D as in Doggy.

[04:05:14:37]
CC:  Hey, very good. Okay, panel 225: circuit
     breaker FLIGHT BUS, MAIN B, to close; circuit
     breaker CTE, MAIN B, to close. Panel 250: CB
     BAT C BAT CHARGER/EDS 2 to close.

[04:05:15:18]
CMP: Hey, Vance, just a minute. Slow down, would you?

[04:05:15:21]
CC:  Okay.

[04:05:15:24]
CMP: Okay. I got distracted here. On panel 225: CB
     FLIGHT BUS, MAIN B, close; and then I lost you
     after that.

[04:05:15:37]
CC:  Okay. After that, CB CTE, MAIN B, to close.
     Next, panel 250: CB BAT C BAT CHARGE/EDS2 to
     close; CB BAT C POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING to
     close. Next, panel 275: CB MAIN B, BAT BUS B,
     to close; CB INVERTER POWER 2, MAIN B, to close.
     Okay. Incidentally, anything that I've given
     you up until now is not sequence critical, but
     from now on, it should be - you should be sure
     to do it in the sequence we give you. Why don't
     you read that back, Jack?

[04:05:17:38]
CMP: Okay. Let me give you all of panel 225 again.
     CB FLIGHT BUS, MAIN B, close; CB CTE, MAIN B,
     close. On panel 250: CB BAT - B BAT CHARGE,
     that should be BAT C, Charlie, isn't it? BAT
     CHARGE/EDS2 closed?

[04:05:18:01]
CC:  That's right. That's - -

[04:05:18:02]
CMP: CB BAT B POWER ENTRY -

[04:05:18:06]
CC:  Okay. That should be BAT Charlie.

[04:05:18:08]
CMP: Let me finish. Okay. That's what I thought.
     BAT Charlie BAT CHARGE/EDS2, close; BAT Baker
     POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, closed. On panel 275:
     CB MAIN B, BAT BUS B, closed; CB INVERTER POWER 2,
     MAIN B, closed.

[04:05:18:32]
CC:  Okay. That's correct except for the second 
     circuit breaker on panel 250, which is CB BAT Charlie
     POWER ENTRY slash POSTLANDING, close.

[04:05:18:50]
_page : 507
_tape : Tape 68/18
CMP: Okay. BAT Charlie POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING.

[04:05:18:57]
CC:  Okay, now back to panel 250. CB BAT Bravo POWER
     ENTRY/POSTLANDING, close. Next, MDC 3, AC 
     INVERTER 2 to MAIN B. AC INVERTER 2, AC BUS 1, on
     up. Next, panel 5: AC INVERTER AC BUS 1 to 
     RESET and then center. Panel 3: UP TLM to 
     COMMAND RESET then OFF. Then select best OMNI.
     Readback, please.

[04:05:20:48]
CMP: Okay, Vance. The following steps are sequence
     critical. Panel 250: CB BAT B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING,
     closed. That's BAT Baker. MDC 3, AC
     INVERTER 2, to MAIN B; AC INVERTER 2, AC1, on. ...

[04:05:21:27]
CC:  How do you read now, Jack?

[04:05:21:31]
CMP: Okay, Vance. Did you - how far did you - did you
     copy any of my steps there?

[04:05:21:37]
CC:  Okay, I heard you through AC INVERTER 2, AC BUS 1
     to on, and you were cut out by noise. Go ahead.

[04:05:21:48]
CMP: Okay, Now comes to one I didn't understand. You
     said go over to MDC 5 and A in - AC INVERTER, AC
     BUS 1, RESET, then center, and then back to MDC 3;
     UP TELEMETRY, COMMAND RESET then OFF, and then
     select best OMNI.

[04:05:22:10]
CC:  Roger. The readback's correct, but let me recheck
     that. Stand by.

[04:05:22:31]
CC:  Jack, we were incorrect on panel 5; that should
     have been panel 3.

[04:05:22:39]
CMP: Okay, that's good. I got it.

[04:05:22:44]
CC:  Okay. Now, when you're in this configuration,
     the following onboard readouts are required.
     Panel 3: BAT C voltage, PYRO BAT A voltage,
     PYRO BAT B voltage, [glossary:SPS] HELIUM PRESSURE. And
     the following readouts on panel 101: [glossary:CM] [glossary:RCS]
     injector temperatures, those are positions
     5 Charlie, 5 Delta, 6 Alfa, 6 Bravo, 6 Charlie,
     6 Delta; and the battery manifold pressure,
     which is 4 Alfa. And standing by for readback.

[04:05:24:40]
CMP: Okay. You want me to read out on MDC 3: BAT B
     voltage, PYRO A voltage, PYRO B voltage, [glossary:SPS]
     HELIUM PRESSURE. On panel 101: command module
     [glossary:RCS] injector temperatures; 5 Charlie, 5 Dog,
     6 Alfa, 6 Baker, 6 Charlie, 6 Dog. The battery
     manifold pressure, 4 Alfa.

[04:05:25:09]
_page : 508
_tape : Tape 68/19
CC:  Okay. Now - that was correct but I want to 
     re-check the very first one, that was BAT Charlie
     voltage. Is that what you read back?

[04:05:25:18]
CMP: Okay. Okay, BAT Charlie voltage. Seems like
     we're having a difference - I can't understand
     BAT Charlie from BAT Dog.

[04:05:25:30]
CC:  Okay. Now, that - that complete procedure for
     getting into it, as far as getting into it's
     concerned. What I will give you now is how to
     back out of it after you're through with your
     readings. Are you ready to copy?

[04:05:25:52]
CMP: Okay.

[04:05:25:55]
CC:  Okay. Now you'll back out fairly quickly after
     you go into this procedure. All we'll need is
     about 5 minutes of TM, and so if you're ready
     to copy, here it comes.

[04:05:26:11]
CMP: Go ahead.

[04:05:26:13]
CC:  Panel 3: POWER AMPL to OFF. Incidentally, copy
     this down on a piece of scratch paper as I read
     it, and then later I'll refer back to your first
     list where you can write things in the right-hand margin.

[04:05:26:38]
CMP: Okay.

[04:05:26:41]
CC:  Okay - -

[04:05:26:42]
CMP: Go ahead. You want - Repeat the one on panel 3
     again, Vance.

[04:05:26:48]
CC:  Okay. POWER AMPL, OFF.

[04:05:26:59]
CMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[04:05:27:01]
CC:  TRANSPONDER, OFF. AC INVERTER, 2, to OFF. Okay.
     Next, panel 250: CB BAT Bravo, POWER ENTRY/
     POSTLANDING to open. Stand by 1.

[04:05:28:22]
CC:  Okay, Jack. What I just gave you now on the
     backout is the only thing that's order critical.
     From here on, you can go to the steps for 
     initiating the procedure, and backtrack. In other
     words, you should go to each of the panels that
     I read up and put the circuit breakers back to
     the base-line configuration - or the switches.
     Over.

[04:05:28:56]
_page : 509
_tape : Tape 68/20
CMP: Okay, now here's - to accent, here's the
     sequence-critical sets: POWER AMPL, OFF;
     TRANSPONDER OFF; AC INVERTER, 2, OFF; and the
     last one on panel 250, CB BAT Baker POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING,
     open; and then hit the steps in
     reverse order that you gave them to me, and back
     out, like then I would start on MDC 3 UP TELEMETRY,
     OFF - to OFF; and then AC INVERTER - AC1 BUS 1 to
     OFF; and then AC INVERTER, 2, OFF; AC INVERTER,
     2, MAIN B to OFF. Is that the type of order
     that you want to back out of?

[04:05:29:59]
CC:  That's affirm, but - just for kicks, let's go
     through these panels again, and I'll give you
     the - the position, just to make sure there can
     be no doubt.

[04:05:30:18]
CMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[04:05:30:20]
CC:  Okay. And once again in the - in the area
     where I said order was not critical, it's still
     not critical when you back out. But now I'll go
     ahead. Okay, panel 4: TELCOMM, GROUP 1, AC1,
     it will not be AC1, it'll go to OFF. Panel 5:
     all circuit breakers on that panel which were
     positioned will now come to opened. Over.

[04:05:31:01]
CMP: Okay. Panel 4: TELCOMM, GROUP 1 will go OFF.
     Panel 5: all the circuit breakers that we closed
     will go back to open.

[04:05:31:12]
CC:  Okay. Panel 3: the first three lines have been
     taken care of already in my beginning in the
     backout procedure, so starting with MODE, VOICE,
     that should go back to VOICE. POWER, [glossary:SCE], OFF;
     PMP, OFF; S-BAND ANTENNA, OMNI Bravo. Panel 225:
     CB FLIGHT BUS, MAIN B, open; CB CTE, MAIN B, open.
     Read back.

[04:05:32:19]
CMP: Okay, Vance. I'm going to have to switch OMNIs.
     I'm starting to get some static here.

[04:05:32:23]
CC:  Okay.

[04:05:32:34]
CMP: Okay. How do you read on AFT OMNI?

[04:05:32:37]
CC:  Loud and clear.

[04:05:32:44]
CMP: Okay. On panel 3: the first three steps we took
     care of; MODE, VOICE, to VOICE; POWER, [glossary:SCE], OFF;
     POWER PMP to OFF; and S-BAND OMNI would go back
     to Bravo. Panel 225: FLIGHT BUS, MAIN B, will
     go open; and CB CTE, MAIN B, will go open.

[04:05:33:11]
_page : 510
_tape : Tape 68/21
CC:  That's affirm. The two circuit breakers on
     panel 250 will go open; the two circuit breakers,
     panel 275, will go open. Okay, the circuit
     breakers on panel 250, we took care of already.
     Panel 3: AC INVERTER, 2, we took care of. AC
     INVERTER 2, AC BUS 1 should now go OFF. And the
     remaining two switches on panel 3 we took care of.
     And "Select best OMNI" remains the same. Okay.
     Read back.

[04:05:34:25]
CMP: Okay. The two switches - two circuit breakers
     on panel 250 will go back to open; the two circuit breakers on panel 275 back to open; the
     POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING circuit breaker, we already took care of earlier; AC INVERTER 2; we
     took care of earlier; AC INVERTER 2 to AC BUS 1
     will go to OFF; and AC INVERTER, AC BUS 1, we took
     care of - No, that'll go to OFF; and UP TELEMETRY,
     COMMAND RESET will go OFF.

[04:05:35:14]
CC:  That's correct, Jack. Okay, that's it. And I
     think we're about ready to go with this procedure
     whenever you are.

[04:05:35:28]
CMP: Okay. First we got to go through that procedure
     to power the [glossary:CSM] from the [glossary:LM], is that Charlie?

[04:05:35:35]
CC:  No. No, this is independent of power from the
     [glossary:LM]. This is a - this is purely a [glossary:CSM] - -

[04:05:35:42]
CMP: Okay.

[04:05:35:43]
CC:  This is purely a [glossary:CSM] powerup so we can take a
     look at your telemetry and see how cold the vehicle is and that sort of thing.

[04:05:35:55]
CMP: Okay. It's going in work.

[04:05:36:03]
CMP: Okay, now I won't - I won't have any voice with
     you, so - Is that right? You don't want me to
     get connected up - you want me to just take these
     readings and come back and tell you what I have,
     huh?

[04:05:36:17]
CC:  That's affirm. There'll be no voice. And - -

[04:05:36:22]
CMP: Okay. Okay. In work.

[04:05:36:27]
_page : 511
_tape : Tape 68/22
CC:  I - we presume, though, that there'll be somebody in the [glossary:LM] that we can call if we have to
     get word to you.

[04:05:36:35]
CMP: Oh, yes. There'll be somebody to be standing
     by, they'll run up into the bedroom and tell me
     to stop what I'm doing.

[04:05:36:44]
CC:  Okay, and let us know when you start.

[04:05:36:51]
CMP: Okay. I'm going to start right now, Vance.

[04:05:36:54]
_extra : END OF TAPE
CC:  Okay.

[04:05:37:12]
_page : 512
_tape : Tape 69/1
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[04:05:37:30]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[04:05:37:36]
CDR: Okay, Houston; Aquarius. Switching watches, and
     Jack's going up into the command module.

[04:05:37:43]
CC:  Okay, Jim. We have four steps here to give you
     to request that you get back on DOWN VOICE BACKUP,
     if you're ready to copy?

[04:05:38:03]
CDR: Ready to copy.

[04:05:38:04]
CC:  Okay. Bit rate to LO bit rate. VOICE, FUNCTION
     switch to DOWN VOICE BACKUP. POWER AMPs CB, open;
     RANGE FUNCTION switch in RANGING; that's verify.

[04:05:38:47]
CDR: Okay. Bit rate, LO; VOICE FUNCTION, DOWN VOICE
     BACKUP; POWER AMP S-BAND, open; and RANGE FUNCTION
     to RANGE; and that's a verify. And I still have
     the BIOMED on RIGHT here, so we don't have hot
     mike.

[04:05:39:08]
CC:  Okay. Thank you.

[04:05:39:12]
CDR: And, you want that in work, now?

[04:05:39:14]
CC:  That's affirm.

[04:05:39:17]
CDR: Okay.

[04:05:39:50]
CDR: Okay. Houston, Aquarius. How do you read?

[04:05:39:53]
CC:  Loud and clear, Jim.

[04:05:39:57]
CDR: Okay. I have a question for you, Houston, if
     you have time.

[04:05:40:00]
CC:  Sure, go ahead.

[04:05:40:05]
CDR: And I'm copying down the reestablishing - [glossary:PTC]
     maneuver that Charlie gave me. Step 5 was,
     "When rates are less than 0.05 degrees per
     second, ATTITUDE CONTROL YAW to PULSE." And
     just how am I to get my rates down to 0.05 degrees per second. My - My rate indicator, at
     the best, is 0.1 of a degree.

[04:05:40:37]
_page : 513
_tape : Tape 69/2
CC:  Stand by.

[04:05:41:38]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[04:05:41:43]
CDR: Go ahead.

[04:05:41:44]
CC:  Jim, this has been tried in the simulator by
     Charlie and others, and what they recommend is
     that you null your rates on the error needles
     until you see no movement whatsoever, and then
     wait another couple of minutes, and that should
     do it. That's the only way we can tell. Over.

[04:05:42:09]
CDR: Okay. I'll give it the old college try.

[04:05:42:12]
CC:  Okay. And if you can't attain that, why, of
     course, just the best you can do. We'll have to
     give it a try. Maybe it won't be quite like
     the simulator.

[04:05:42:24]
CDR: Right.

[04:05:48:43]
CMP: Okay, Houston; Aquarius.

[04:05:48:47]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[04:05:48:50]
CMP: Okay, Vance. I've gone all the way through your
     procedure - all the way down to "Select best
     OMNIs," but I'm not getting any MAIN BUS B
     voltage and this I don't understand.

[04:05:49:03]
CC:  Roger.

[04:05:49:04]
CMP: I can read - I can read BAT - BAT BUS B voltage
     at 36.5. ...

[04:05:49:43]
CC:  Okay, Jack. Do you read now?

[04:05:49:48]
CMP: I am not sure, Vance.

[04:05:49:51]
CC:  Okay. You faded out due to noise in the orientation. If you close the POWER AMP circuit
     breaker, we can hear you better. Over.

[04:05:50:07]
CC:  That's panel 16.

[04:05:50:11]
CMP: Okay.

[04:05:50:13]
CC:  Okay. You faded out at the very beginning, so
     please go through that again. We understand you
     don't get anything on MAIN B.

[04:05:50:39]
_page : 514
_tape : Tape 69/3
CMP: Okay, Vance. How are you reading now?

[04:05:50:43]
CC:  Okay. We're hearing you better. Stand by 1.

[04:05:52:24]
CC:  Okay, Jack. Please, repeat back now your
     conversation. You were cut out for - a while
     ago.

[04:05:52:36]
CMP: I don't have any idea where we cut out, Vance.
     I just said that we performed the procedure
     exactly as you say. We're down into the SEP
     critical portion to where I said, "select best
     OMNI." However, we're not getting any MAIN
     BUS B voltage reading. I can read BAT BUS B,
     Baker, at 36.5; BAT Charlie at 37.0, but I
     have negative MAIN BUS B readings.

[04:05:53:08]
CC:  Okay. Stand by.

[04:05:53:24]
CC:  Okay, Jack. There are two - There's a switch
     and a circuit breaker that were positioned this
     morning that we'd like to have you check -
     Correction, just the switch. Panel 5, check
     your bus tie. MAIN BUS TIE BAT B/C on.

[04:05:53:47]
CMP: That is verified on. I checked that.

[04:05:53:50]
CC:  Okay.

[04:05:55:22]
CC:  Okay, Jack; this is Houston. Over.

[04:05:55:29]
CMP: Go ahead, Vance.

[04:05:55:31]
CC:  Okay. We're getting data from you, Jack, so
     that much looks good. On panel 5, request
     verification that [glossary:EPS] SENSOR SIGNAL circuit
     breaker is MAIN B. Over.

[04:05:55:47]
CMP: Okay.

[04:05:55:48]
CC:  Or it's - -

[04:05:55:49]
CMP: - - Stand by. - -

[04:05:55:50]
CC:  - - that MAIN B is closed.

[04:05:55:53]
CMP: Okay.

[04:05:56:10]
CC:  Okay, Jack. And, we see your MAIN BUS B voltage
     at 28-1/2.

[04:05:56:17]
_page : 515
_tape : Tape 69/4
CMP: Okay. You can see it. Good. Okay then.
     Okay, Vance. That circuit breaker is in.

[04:05:56:28]
CC:  Copy.

[04:05:56:42]
CMP: Well, Vance, if you're getting data from them,
     let me go back up there and finish the ...

[04:05:56:52]
CC:  Okay, Jack. Please repeat, you're cutting out.

[04:05:56:54]
CMP: Okay, Vance. Okay. We just changed OMNIs here.
     I say, if you're getting data from us, that's
     the important thing. Let me go back up into
     the bedroom there and get the readings you
     wanted, so we can get this stuff powered down.
     Is that okay?

[04:05:57:10]
CMP: Okay, we'll get - -

[04:05:57:11]
CC:  - - by all means and - -

[04:05:57:12]
CMP: - - down there - -

[04:05:57:13]
CC:  - - select best OMNI - -

[04:05:57:14]
CMP: - - and then go back up.

[04:05:57:22]
CMP: Okay, Vance. We'll go back up - We've got
     voltage now, and we'll go back up and take the
     readings that you want.

[04:05:57:34]
CC:  Okay. And select best OMNI.

[04:05:57:44]
CMP: Okay. I'm going back up into the bedroom,
     Vance. How do you read?

[04:05:57:47]
CC:  Loud and clear.

[04:05:57:51]
CMP: Okay. I'm going back up to the bedroom. We'll
     select best OMNI and continue on with the procedure.

[04:05:57:58]
CC:  Roger.

[04:05:58:47]
CDR: Okay, Vance. Jim's up. How do you read?

[04:05:58:50]
CC:  Reading you loud and clear, Jim.

[04:05:58:54]
CDR: Okay.

[04:05:59:07]
CDR: And, Houston, I noticed through the [glossary:AOT] and
     through the overhead docking window that we
     are venting again.

[04:05:59:16]
_page : 516
_tape : Tape 69/5
CC:  Okay, Jim. Understand; the service module is
     venting.

[04:05:59:22]
CDR: That's affirm.

[04:06:01:17]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[04:06:01:22]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[04:06:01:24]
CC:  Jim, would you holler into the bedroom and tell
     Jack that when he has his onboard readouts that
     we wish he'd back - use the backout procedure
     and shut down again - per the procedure we gave
     him.

[04:06:01:39]
CDR: Roger. As soon as he - As soon as he gets his
     onboard readouts to use the powerdown procedure
     and shut down. Is that right?

[04:06:01:47]
CC:  That's affirm.

[04:06:01:49]
CDR: Okay. Jack just - Jack just told me that he's
     through, and he's going to go through the backout procedures again, the first one he's got is
     the shutdown.

[04:06:01:54]
CC:  Okay.

[04:06:08:19]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[04:06:08:24]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[04:06:08:28]
CDR: Jack's ready to give you the readings if you
     are ready to copy them.

[04:06:08:31]
CC:  Stand by.

[04:06:08:40]
CC:  Okay. Go ahead.

[04:06:08:51]
CMP: Okay, Vance. The readings that you wanted;
     are you ready?

[04:06:08:57]
CC:  Ready to copy, Jack.

[04:06:09:01]
CMP: BAT Charlie, 37.0; pyro A, 37.0; pyro B, 37.0;
     [glossary:SPS] helium pressure, 3450; and just for kicks,
     nitrogen A, 2300; nitrogen B, 2400; [glossary:CM] [glossary:RCS]
     injector temperatures: 5 Charlie, 4.5; 5 Dog,
     3.5; 6 Alfa, 4.0; 6 Baker, 4.6; 6 Charlie, 4.0;

[04:06:10:11]
_page : 517
_tape : Tape 69/6
CC:  Okay, Jack, We got it. Thank you very much.

[04:06:10:17]
CMP: Okay. How does the telemetry look on our -
     on the old Odyssey?

[04:06:10:21]
CC:  It doesn't look too cold. Looks pretty good.

[04:06:10:27]
CMP: Okay. Thank you very much.

[04:06:10:30]
CC:  You bet.

[04:06:10:31]
CMP: We're going to need him.

[04:06:10:37]
CC:  How does it feel, Jack?

[04:06:10:42]
CMP: I'll tell you, Deke, it's cold up in there. I
     don't know whether we'll be able to sleep up
     there tonight; it must be about 35 or 40 degrees.

[04:06:10:52]
CC:  Roger. That's just what I was worrying about.

[04:06:10:59]
CMP: Right now, we're getting two sets of CWGs on.

[04:06:11:12]
CMP: It's not uncomfortable at all in Aquarius, but it
     definitely is cold in Odyssey.

[04:06:11:18]
CC:  Roger.

[04:06:11:45]
CDR: Okay, Vance. Jim's back on.

[04:06:11:50]
CC:  Go ahead, Jim.

[04:06:11:54]
CDR: We just had a change in watch; that's all.

[04:06:11:57]
CC:  Okay.

[04:06:14:38]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston, Over.

[04:06:14:44]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[04:06:14:46]
CC:  Jim, two items: in the command module, we wish
     to verify that the PYRO BATTERY selector was left
     in the main position. And we're ready to have
     the POWER AMP circuit breaker on panel 16 pulled,
     whenever you are ready.

[04:06:15:43]
_page : 518
_tape : Tape 69/7
CDR: Okay, Vance. Fred just tells me that he put it
     there, and we're checking that again about the
     PYRO BATTERY selector in the main position.

[04:06:15:54]
CC:  Okay. Understand that you are checking it.

[04:06:15:59]
CDR: And I will pull the POWER AMP circuit breaker.

[04:06:16:01]
CC:  Roger.

[04:06:25:49]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[04:06:25:54]
CC:  Go ahead, Jim.

[04:06:25:57]
CDR: How does number 2 battery look to you now?

[04:06:26:07]
CC:  Stand by.

[04:06:26:48]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[04:06:26:53]
CDR: Go ahead.

[04:06:26:55]
CC:  Jim, it looks like it was probably a sensor
     problem; the battery number 2 is load-sharing
     well. And we see no indications of higher
     temperatures in the glycol loop or anything
     that would make us think that it is heating
     up.

[04:06:27:14]
CDR: Okay. Thank you.

[04:06:27:16]
CC:  Roger.

[04:06:51:18]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[04:06:51:24]
CC:  Roger. Go ahead.

[04:06:51:30]
CDR: I just want to talk over a little philosophy here.
     Fred told me that at one time you came up and told
     him that we were a little steep on the entry angle,
     and now our burn is going to make us - give us a
     steeper angle. I just want to make sure that
     we're all talking about the same thing, that, in
     essence, at this particular situation, we're
     shallow, are not steep, and we are going to increase the angle.

[04:06:52:08]
CC:  Jim, the situation is that, at the moment, we're
     a little bit shallow, and retrograde midcourse
     is going to put us more in the center of the
     corridor. Over.

[04:06:52:27]
_page : 519
_tape : Tape 69/8
CDR: Okay; fine. I just wanted to make sure. Fred
     had written down some time ago, that - that
     our angle now was about 71 and we were going to
     do a midcourse of 7 feet per second because its
     appears that we're going to shallow it out. I
     think we're all talking the same language now.

[04:06:52:47]
CC:  Roger. And, I guess it follows, but your perigee
     is a little bit high right now, too; so that
     will be bringing it back - back down, that is.

[04:06:52:57]
CDR: Yes. Yes, that's the important thing.

[04:06:53:16]
CC:  One other question, Jim. Our readings down
     here say your [glossary:LM] cabin's about as cold as the
     command module cabin. Is that right?

[04:06:53:29]
CDR: Well, we really don't know. There's usually
     two people in the [glossary:LM] cabin, and it's a lot -
     It seems to be a lot more compact, and so we
     don't notice the coldness down here as we do
     in the command module.

[04:06:53:41]
CC:  Okay.

[04:06:56:32]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[04:06:56:35]
CC:  Go ahead.

[04:06:56:40]
CDR: Some time ago, I copied down a long COMM
     midcourse-7 corridor control burn at a [glossary:GET] of
     [time:05:14:59:42|134:59:42.98]. Is that burn pad still valid?

[04:06:57:07]
CC:  Jim, that's affirm. That pad is still valid.

[04:06:57:14]
CDR: And that is assuming no midcourse 7 here at
     105 hours.

[04:06:57:19]
CC:  That's affirm.

[04:06:57:58]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[04:06:58:03]
CDR: Go ahead.

[04:06:58:04]
CC:  Jim, we're setting up your burn for [time:04:09:30:00|105:30], and
     we'll be working up a pad, et cetera, based on
     that time. Over.

[04:06:58:17]
CDR: Roger. The time will [time:04:09:30:00|105:30].

[04:06:58:21]
CC:  And, additional point; I guess this one's for
     Jack. Do we have any idea why we couldn't read
     the MAIN BUS B voltage a while back when first
     he didn't get it and then later he did?

[04:06:58:40]
_page : 520
_tape : Tape 69/9
CDR: Yes. I think we have a reason for that. Stand
     by.

[04:06:59:04]
CDR: It appears, Vance, that the battery charge circuit
     breaker which appeared to be in, wasn't in. Fred
     pulled it and reset it, and then he started getting readings.

[04:06:59:17]
CC:  Roger. Which circuit breaker was that?

[04:06:59:28]
CDR: It was - It was the battery charge circuit breaker
     that allows you to read volts, but we haven't -
     don't know the exact name for it yet.

[04:06:59:39]
CC:  Okay. Understand.

[04:06:59:48]
CDR: The name is BATTERY CHARGER BAT B CHARGE Jack
     tells me.

[04:06:59:52]
CC:  Okay. BATTERY CHARGER BAT B CHARGE.

[04:07:00:22]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[04:07:00:25]
CDR: Go ahead.

[04:07:00:28]
CC:  Have you opened your - just curiosity - Have
     you opened your food locker just aft of the [glossary:LM]
     data file? Over.

[04:07:00:51]
CDR: Yes. It's been opened.

[04:07:00:55]
CC:  Okay. Just checking. Thanks.

[04:07:00:57]
CDR: . .. meal had come through.

[04:07:01:00]
CC:  Good.

[04:07:01:14]
CDR: It came at the right time.

[04:07:01:18]
CC:  Good.

[04:07:03:30]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[04:07:03:36]
CDR: Go ahead.

[04:07:03:38]
CC:  Jim, we have some [glossary:CSM] temperatures here for you
     that might be of interest, if you're ready to
     copy.

[04:07:03:56]
_page : 521
_tape : Tape 69/10
CDR: Roger. Go ahead.

[04:07:03:58]
CC:  Okay. Your quad package temperatures range from
     85 degrees to 44 degrees. Your [glossary:CM] [glossary:RCS] injectors
     range from 44 degrees to 21; and your heat shield
     is well above its lower limits in all the various
     locations. Temperatures appear to be cycling
     based on Sun angle, and it's no sweat. They all
     look very good.

[04:07:04:45]
_extra : END OF TAPE
CDR: Sounds good.

[04:07:27:08]

[04:07:27:12]
CC:  Negative, Jim.

[04:07:27:16]
CDR: Okay.

[04:07:42:51]
LMP: And, Houston, how do you read Aquarius?

[04:07:42:54]
CC:  Read you loud and clear, Fred. How do you read?

[04:07:42:59]
LMP: Okay. ...

[04:07:43:01]
CC:  Roger. We were just about to send you up some
     items of information pertaining to the burn.
     Are you ready to copy?

[04:07:43:13]
LMP: Stand by.

[04:07:43:15]
CC:  Okay.

[04:07:43:40]
LMP: Okay. Go ahead, Vance.

[04:07:43:43]
CC:  Okay, Fred. First of all, preparations for this,
     starting with contingency checklist, page 24, we
     would recommend should start at [time:04:08:30:00|104:30] [glossary:GET], and
     we'll be happy to receive any comments you have
     on that, though. Second point: when you're in
     the burn attitude, you should see the Sun at the
     very top of the [glossary:AOT]. It'll be splitting the cursor,
     when your cursor's set at zero. One thing to be
     aware of though, that it'll slip right out of the
     [glossary:AOT] very easily since it'll be very sensitive to
     roll and yaw. Understand that's in detent 2, by
     the way. Next point: the burn is very insensitive to burn time and attitude. In other words,
     if necessary, we can slip it if there's any
     problem at all, and attitude isn't too critical.
     So that brings us to the point that we only have
     one real burn rule; that is, if - rate about any
     axis gets to 10 degrees a second, that's the
     limit to stop the burn. Next point, after you
     finish the burn, and before you trim, request
     that you leave [glossary:DEDA] in address 470 up a while so
     we can take a look at it, and let us holler when
     we've seen it, and then proceed on. Over.

[04:07:45:54]
LMP: Okay, Vance. You're saying we should start into
     the PREP in the contingency book at about [time:04:08:30:00|104:30],
     and I'll talk this over in a minute with Jim and
     we'll get back with you on it. When in the burn
     attitude, we should see the Sun right at the top
     of the [glossary:AOT], and I assume this is detent number 2.
     Jim and I'd already been talking about that, and
     just eyeballing the terminator in the Earth, we
     figured the Sun at about something like a
     70-degree angle - 65-degree angle, so that'll be
     right up there. We get one burn rule that says
     if the rates are greater than 10 degrees per
     second, shut her down. And, after we trim, you
     want me to leave 470 up for a while so you all
     can have a look at it, and you'll tell me when
     to get rid of it.

[04:07:46:52]
_page : 523
_tape : Tape 70/2
CC:  That's right, Fred. And, if you have any questions at all regarding the alinement, why please
     let us know. We'll be happy to answer them, like
     alining on the Earth, as was described before.
     Also, you should know that the pitch is the most
     critical attitude so far as errors are concerned
     in this burn; but, as I said, it's still not
     very sensitive.

[04:07:47:30]
LMP: Yes, the - and unfortunately, the way we're
     looking out the window through the [glossary:COAS], we can
     aline the yaw and roll pretty well, but it's
     the - Sun that has to get us pitch.

[04:07:47:43]
CC:  Right. And - and a correction on this [glossary:DEDA]
     470 thing. Request that we let you - Give you a
     GO before you trim. Over.

[04:07:47:57]
LMP: Say - Say again, Vance, on that last.

[04:07:48:00]
CC:  Roger. We would like to see address 470, and
     give you a GO before you trim. Over.

[04:07:48:10]
LMP: Oh, okay. I - I see. Okay. After burn, we'll
     leave 470 up a while and wait for your word to
     do the trim.

[04:07:48:18]
CC:  That's correct. How was the sleep?

[04:07:49:59]
LMP: Okay. And -

[04:07:50:15]
LMP: Okay. Vance, are you there?

[04:07:50:17]
CC:  Roger. Go ahead.

[04:07:50:21]
LMP: Okay. The picture that Jim gave me on his view
     through the [glossary:COAS] was within the - the partial
     Earth, the lit portion laying in the top half
     of the [glossary:COAS] with the cusp laying right on the
     Y-Y line. And so the - The whole dark part of
     the Earth would be at the bottom part of the
     Earth, except a very thin crescent of the dark
     part to a line - line above the Y-Y line.

[04:07:50:59]
_page : 524
_tape : Tape 70/3
CC:  Okay. That is correct.

[04:07:51:00]
LMP: And that in essence - that in - Yes, that in
     essence would put our X-axis pointing toward
     the Sun.

[04:07:51:07]
CC:  That's correct. The plus X-axis pointing toward
     the Sun and perpendicular to the terminator of
     the Earth.

[04:07:51:18]
LMP: Okay.

[04:07:51:20]
CC:  Two other points, Fred. One is that we don't
     expect hardly any misalinement of your engine
     for the burn, so we don't really expect any rates
     throughout the length of the burn, especially
     since it's at very low thrust. Second point,
     request you verify that your suit temperature
     rheostat's in FULL COLD. That - if it - If it
     were in FULL COLD, that might help your cabin
     temperature situation. It might bring the
     temperature up.

[04:07:52:02]
LMP: Okay.

[04:07:52:19]
LMP: Okay. The latter was a good point. We had it
     in FULL HOT.

[04:07:52:24]
CC:  Very good.

[04:07:52:25]
LMP: And Roger on the - Roger on the rates, too.

[04:07:52:30]
CC:  Okay.

[04:07:53:18]
LMP: Okay, Vance. Is the [glossary:Tig|T<sub>ig</sub>] time going to be
     approximately - Is it 105 or [time:04:09:30:00|105:30]?

[04:07:53:26]
CC:  It's [time:04:09:30:00|105:30].

[04:07:53:31]
LMP: Okay. Your [time:04:08:30:00|104:30] time to start in is - sounds
     pretty good. That'll give us lots of time to
     get set up with the attitude business, in case
     we have any trouble stopping [glossary:PTC] and getting
     there and - That will give us a little time to
     be sitting and waiting, all set up.

[04:07:53:49]

CC:  Okay, Fred. Good.

[04:07:58:53]
LMP: Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[04:07:59:00]
LMP: Are you calling, Vance?

[04:07:59:02]
CC:  Right, Fred. We just noticed a 2-pound drop
     in your water quantity. Have you guys had a
     drink recently or do you know any reason why
     it might have dropped? Over.

[04:07:59:16]
LMP: Negative.

[04:07:59:21]
CC:  Thank you.

[04:08:00:28]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[04:08:00:33]
LMP: All right. Go ahead, Vance.

[04:08:00:35]
CC:  Fred, that may be a funny in the data. The rate's
     gone back to normal; and we'll keep an eye on it,
     but we don't think you should worry about it too
     much.

[04:08:00:50]
LMP: Let's hope not.

[04:08:19:06]
LMP: And, Houston, Aquarius.

[04:08:19:07]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[04:08:19:12]
LMP: Are we going to get any sort of a pad on this?

[04:08:19:20]
CC: That's affirm, Fred. Estimating we'll have it
     to you in about 15 minutes.

[04:08:19:28]
LMP: Okay.

[04:08:19:47]
LMP: And, Houston, you might just let us know if
     there's any chance it's going to slip further
     down the road, because we're going to kind of
     hold to that [time:04:08:30:00|104:30] start time. And if you're
     going to delay any, we'll delay accordingly.

[04:08:20:03]
CC: Roger. We won't have any trouble making that,
     Fred, I'm told.

[04:08:20:12]
LMP: Okay.

[04:08:32:44]
CC:  Roger. Copy, Jim. And the - Jack's going to
     read you the pad right now, so I recommend you
     go ahead and get started. You shouldn't be
     delayed by the pad at all.

[04:08:33:24]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. I've got your burn pad.

[04:08:33:37]
CDR: Roger, Houston. Stand by. Are you ready -
     Stand by to copy. Okay. Ready to copy.

[04:08:33:43]
CC:  Okay. A [glossary:P30] maneuver pad on the [glossary:DPS]: purpose
     is midcourse 5, [glossary:NOUN 33], [time:04:09:30:00|105:30:00.00], [glossary:NOUN 81]

[04:08:35:36]
CC:  Okay, Fred. I want to verify that your DELTA-V<sub>R</sub>
     is 0007.8.

[04:08:35:48]
LMP: Okay. I read you back 0007.8.

[04:08:35:53]

CC:  Aquarius, Houston, I have some additional entry
     data that goes with the pad I just read up.
     It's five items. Let me know when you're ready
     to copy. It's on a maneuver pad.

[04:08:38:55]
LMP: Okay. I'll try to squeeze them in there, Jack.
     I'm rapidly running out of pads.

[04:08:39:08]
LMP: Go ahead.

[04:08:39:11]
CC:  Okay. It's N/A all the way down to [glossary:NOUN 61].
     Your latitude is minus 21 - -

[04:08:39:20]

     Hold on, Jack, I need the other pad book, that
     [glossary:CSM] pad.

[04:08:39:26]
CC:  That's affirm.

[04:08:39:45]
LMP: Okay. Now I'm ready.

[04:08:39:47]
CC:  Okay. NOUN 61: latitude, minus 21.67, minus

CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[04:08:46:44]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[04:08:46:47]
CDR: Did you have readouts on our quad temps to know
     when we can start? We're taking a time hack.
     We'd just like a verification with you.

[04:08:46:55]
CC:  Roger. Your quad temps look good from here.

[04:08:50:03]
CDR: Okay, Houston; Aquarius. We're going to stop
     [glossary:PTC] at this time.

[04:08:50:09]
CC:  Roger, Aquarius. Go ahead.

[04:08:52:51]
CC:  How about if you do - -

[04:08:52:56]
LMP: Say again, Jack.

[04:08:52:59]
CC:  Negits on my last, Fred.

[04:08:53:12]
LMP: Okay, Jack. How do you read now?

[04:08:53:20]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[04:08:53:26]
LMP: Okay. I thought you called, Jack. We're
     maneuvering around here to fish for the Earth.

[04:08:54:26]
LMP: And, Houston, Aquarius. How's the ASA package
     temp look now?

[04:08:54:52]
CC:  Okay, Fred. The ASA package temp is looking
     good. It's around 98 degrees, and we'd like to
     see it go up about 15 to 20 degrees.

[04:08:55:03]
LMP: Okay. Why don't you give me the word before
     I proceed with the [glossary:AGS]. We really don't need
     it right this instant.

[04:08:55:10]
CC:  Roger. We'll be watching it.

[04:08:58:11]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. The ASA package temp is up
     now so you can activate the [glossary:AGS].

[04:08:58:19]
LMP: Okay. Very good.

[04:09:01:07]
LMP: Okay, Jack. So we can make sure and get our
     timer set here, I wondered when your - you've
     got about 48 minutes to the burn which should
     be coming up pretty quick - you'd give us a
     hack so we could set our event timer at 12.

[04:09:01:32]
_page : 529
_tape : Tape 71/2
CC:  Roger, Fred. I understand you want a mark at
     17 minutes prior to the burn. Is that affirm?

[04:09:01:39]
LMP: Roger. We think we got it set now. We just
     wanted to check it. If we don't, then I'll set
     it to 13, and you can give me another hack at
     47 to go.

[04:09:01:56]
CC:  Okay. We got 33 to go.

[04:09:01:59]
CC:  MARK.

[04:09:02:03]
CC:  My mistake. It was 33 - -

[04:09:02:05]
LMP: Right on.

[04:09:02:06]
CC:  Roger. It was reading 33 on my mark. Right?

[04:09:02:32]
LMP: Okay. You got about [time:04:09:03:00|105:03] [glossary:GET] now down there?

[04:09:02:39]
CC:  That's affirmative, Fred. Going through [time:04:09:03:45|105:03:45].

[04:09:03:44]
CC:  MARK.

[04:09:03:48]
LMP: Okay.

[04:09:04:03]
LMP: Okay, Jack. Give me the next number you want
     me to set then, and I'll take another hack here.

[04:09:04:08]
CC:  Roger. You're counting up, right?

[04:09:04:12]
LMP: Roger.

[04:09:04:49]
CC:  Okay, Fred. On my mark, be 35 minutes to the
     burn.

[04:09:04:58]
LMP: Standing by.

[04:09:05:13]

     minute.

[04:09:05:17]
LMP: Okay.

[04:09:05:52]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. On my mark, it's going to be
     34 minutes to the burn, and you'll be reading 36.
     Stand by.

[04:09:05:59]
_page : 530
_tape : Tape 71/3
CC:  MARK.

[04:09:06:03]
LMP: Okay. We got it cranked up.

[04:09:10:29]
CDR: Okay, Houston. We have our attitude set.

[04:09:10:35]
CC:  Roger, Jim.

[04:09:10:39]
CDR: I hope the guys in the back room who thought this
     up right knew what they were saying.

[04:09:10:50]
LMP: And I'm looking through the [glossary:AOT] there, Jack, and
     the Sun's right in the top and it's about maybe
     2 degrees to the right of the cursor. So that
     looks real good.

[04:09:11:01]
CC:  Roger. Good going.

[04:09:12:04]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. The attitude looks good here
     and your choice when you want to start the burn.

[04:09:12:16]
CDR: We're counting down, aren't we, or do you want
     us to start any time?

[04:09:12:22]
CC:  Your choice.

[04:09:12:28]
CDR: You guys are getting easy.

[04:09:12:32]
CC:  It's not time critical, Jim.

[04:09:12:36]
CDR: I understand.

[04:09:15:59]
LMP: And, Houston, we reset our clock and we're
     making the burn in about - I'll give you a
     hack here at 2 minutes to go.

[04:09:16:11]
CC:  Roger, Fred. And let us know when you're going
     to ullage, will you?

[04:09:16:16]
LMP: Okay.

[04:09:16:25]
LMP: Okay. Stand by. 2, 1.

[04:09:16:28]

LMP: Three minutes to go. Correction, 2 minutes to
     go, Jack.

[04:09:16:34]

     please.

[04:09:17:07]
LMP: It's verified to off. And -

[04:09:17:28]
LMP: MARK it.

[04:09:17:29]

LMP: ULLAGE.

[04:09:18:48]
LMP: Okay. You're looking at 470.

[04:09:18:53]
CC:  Roger. We copy 7.4.

[04:09:18:59]
LMP: Roger. 7.4 and I had about 0.2 showing, I guess,
     when we started.

[04:09:19:05]
CC:  Roger. We verify that, Okay, Aquarius. Trim
     it to 7.6.

[04:09:19:18]
LMP: Okay. You want plus-X now to get 7.6. Is that
     correct?

[04:09:19:23]
CC:  That's affirmative.

[04:09:19:42]
LMP: Okay. You're looking at it, Houston.

[04:09:19:46]
CC:  Okay. Looks good. Nice work.

[04:09:19:51]
LMP: Let's hope it was.

[04:09:20:23]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. We're ready to follow you
     through on setting up [glossary:PTC] and powerdown.
     Your choice.

[04:09:20:30]
LMP: Okay. We're pressing into getting [glossary:PTC] established
     right now.

[04:09:26:49]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We'd like to change the number of yaw pulses we gave you before as 21.
     We'd like to reduce that to 12. Twelve pulses
     yaw right, and that'll take you about 3 seconds
     to get them in if you don't want to count them.

[04:09:27:08]
LMP: Okay. We'll make it 12 versus 21.

[04:09:29:50]
_page : 532
_tape : Tape 71/5
CDR: Okay, Houston. I'm just about there now and as
     soon as I get 90, we'll start damping rates.

[04:09:29:57]
CC:  Roger, Aquarius.

[04:09:33:58]
CDR: Okay, Houston. I'm trying to damp rates now.
     We're at the proper roll attitude and pitch.

[04:09:34:05]
CC:  Roger, Aquarius.

[04:09:34:22]
CC:  Working a little bit better this time.

[04:09:34:29]
CDR: Are you copying any attitudes down there, rates,
     et cetera?

[04:09:34:56]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. We're seeing some extremely low
     rates at this time, really below our capability
     to measure them.

[04:09:35:09]
CDR: Roger.

[04:09:36:25]
CDR: Houston, I think I've got pitch and roll just
     about squared away. I let yaw just slightly
     drift; it's drifting in a clockwise direction
     and I'm about all set now to put in my 12 clicks
     to the right.

[04:09:36:44]
CC:  Roger, Jim. Ready to look at it with you.

[04:09:37:59]
CDR: Twelve clicks right.

[04:09:38:13]
LMP: Okay, Jack. Are we clear now to proceed with
     the powerdown?

[04:09:38:22]
CC:  That's affirmative, Fred. We're ready to press
     on with powerdown. I've got two changes for you.
     Step 1 of the emergency powerdown on page power
     - 5. Over.

[04:09:38:36]
LMP: Go ahead.

[04:09:38:37]
CC:  Okay. Leave your POWER AMPLIFIER switch in
     PRIMARY vice OFF and put your RANGING switch to
     RANGE, vice OFF/RESET.

[04:09:38:53]
LMP: Okay. We're in PRIM in the POWER AMP and RANGING
     on RANGING.

[04:09:38:59]

[04:09:39:11]
_page : 533
_tape : Tape 71/6
CDR: Okay. I'm going to pull. Well, here, let's just
     look at the checklist.

[04:09:39:14]
LMP: Okay. Configure CBs. There you go.

[04:09:39:18]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston, hold off 1 on powerdown,
     please.

[04:09:39:23]
LMP: Okay. We'll hold off. And we're looking at a
     SHe pressure, incidentally, of about 1830 now.

[04:09:39:37]
CC:  Roger. We concur with that. And it looks like
     you got a little pitch rate going on here. Do
     you copy the same?

[04:09:39:47]
CDR: Okay. My pitch needle is just slightly up now.
     I could try to take it out if you want me to.

[04:09:39:58]
LMP: Not - Wait, wait. There you go.

[04:09:40:07]
CC:  Just hold off on it 1, Jim. We'd like to take
     a look at it.

[04:09:40:14]
CDR: Okay.

[04:09:40:21]
CC:  Aquarius, we'll need high bit rate, please.

[04:09:40:26]
LMP: Flashlight, Jack. Jack, flashlight over here a
     minute.

[04:09:40:31]
CC:  Aquarius, we need the POWER AMPLIFIER back in
     high bit rate, please.

[04:09:40:37]
LMP: You got it.

[04:09:40:48]
CDR: You got a couple in the roll pretty soon.

[04:09:41:02]
CDR: What is it, 1.7?

[04:09:41:34]
CDR: You have another set of them by the [glossary:PGNS].

[04:09:41:44]
CDR: Now we got to turn on the heaters you want to
     save -

[04:09:41:59]
CDR: What's that flitting out there in the breeze?
     Are we venting again? Take a look, Jack.

[04:09:42:17]
CDR: Well, once we get squared away, Joe, I think
     I am going to have to go to the space center and
     take a good healthy one and leave just about
     everything. I've held up long enough.

[04:09:42:32]
_page : 534
_tape : Tape 71/7
LMP: That's coming from above. Another one just -
     is just coming down right over here. Well,
     there's the old terminator at Fra Mauro. We'd
     been landing about 2 hours ago, huh? Right on
     the - -

[04:09:42:56]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[04:09:42:57]
LMP: - - to the right of the terminator.

[04:09:42:59]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[04:09:43:03]
CDR: Just for information, although I thought I'd
     never have to use it, that technique looked like
     it was a pretty good one.

[04:09:43:13]
CC:  Roger, Jim. And we'd like you to give us your
     idea of how the [glossary:PTC] looks. We're not sure we're
     seeing what we ought to here.

[04:09:43:26]
CDR: Okay. I still have my ball powered up and I'm
     coming around past 270 right now. I've got a
     slight roll and pitch offset in there. My
     pitch needle about halfway up and my roll needle
     is about 4 degrees over now.

[04:09:43:48]
CC:  Okay, Jim. With that info we'll go on the [glossary:PTC],
     and let's proceed with the powerdown.

[04:09:43:59]
CDR: Okay. We'll proceed with the [glossary:PTC] and proceed
     with the powerdown. I guess if we have to we
     can reestablish [glossary:PTC] at a later date. Okay. Okay.

[04:09:44:22]
LMP: First row. Ullage. [glossary:AGS].

[04:09:44:31]

[04:09:44:52]
CDR: Okay. Let's - give the last thing to Jack and
     I'll keep it all out. Okay? [glossary:RCS] SYSTEM A.
     That's in. TCAs are going off. Why do they
     need the ISOL valves in the ASCENT FEED in?

[04:09:45:17]
LMP: You're not sucking any power unless you take
     these switches and move them.

_page : 535

CDR: How come we pulled them out, then, in this burn?

[04:09:45:23]
LMP: Because you didn't want them to get moved
     inadvertently, I guess. It doesn't matter, Jim,
     they can be out or in in terms of powerdown.
     They just don't count.

[04:09:45:46]
CDR: Okay. I got 1, 2, 3.

[04:09:45:54]
LMP: ISOL valve should be in 2.

[04:09:45:56]

     I still have in.

LMP: Jack, how do you read now in baseband?

[04:09:46:44]
CC:  Reading you 5-square, Fred. How me?

[04:09:46:48]
LMP: Okay. I'll stay this mode, if it's all right,
     so we won't be hot miked.

[04:09:46:56]
CC:  Roger.

[04:09:52:28]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. You're cleared to open the
     POWER AMPLIFIER circuit breaker and go to LOW
     BIT RATE, leaving the POWER AMP switch in
     PRIMARY.

[04:09:52:40]
LMP: Okay. I'll pull the prime S-BAND POWER AMP
     breaker and go LOW BIT RATE.

LMP: Houston, Aquarius.

[04:10:04:28]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[04:10:04:34]
LMP: About how far out are we now, Jack?

[04:10:04:49]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. You're 150 000 miles and you're
     coming in at 4500 feet a second. That's from
     the Earth.

[04:10:05:01]
LMP: Okay. We're at 100 - Yes. 150 K, 4500 feet a
     second.

[04:10:05:27]
CC:  And, Aquarius, how much [glossary:TTCA] control did you have
     to do in the burn?

[04:10:05:34]
LMP: How much - What was that, Jack?

[04:10:05:36]

     during the burn?

LMP: I wasn't noticing Jim too much. I'd say I put

     needle widths.

[04:10:06:02]
CC:  Roger, Fred. Thank you.

[04:10:06:11]

CC: Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?

[04:10:33:45]
CMP: I read you loud and clear, Jack.

[04:10:33:48]
CC:  Okay, Jack. What's your status, who's
     sleeping, and who's working?

[04:10:33:55]
CMP: Well, right now we're all three kind of
     working. Do you have any recommendations?

[04:10:34:04]
CC:  Yes, looks like to us from here that you and
     Fred ought to get some sleep, and that you
     ought to eat in about 6 hours. And that the
     Skipper ought to go to bed about 113 hours.

[04:10:34:23]
CMP: Okay.

[04:10:34:24]
CC: I've got some other information. We shouldn't
     have some good dope on your trajectory for about
     2 hours. Looked like to us that the burn was
     real good, however, and we're taking a close
     look at it, and we'll get back with you on that
     in about 2 hours from now. Another thing that
     we're expecting to have happen is that the
     SHe tank is going to reach its burst limit. The
     earliest time we predict this will happen will
     be at 107 hours on about 25 minutes. And the
     latest probable time is at 110 hours, and this
     is supposed to be a nonpropulsive vent, but you
     might hear it and you might see something.

[04:10:35:06]
CMP: Okay. That's good news. We were wondering about
     that. And I'll relay all the other information
     you gave me.

[04:10:35:14]
CC:  Okay. And if the SHe tank does burst during this
     time frame before we get trajectory info, why,
     that will delay our trajectory info somewhat.
     Your consumables, your water is now good through
     152 hours.

[04:10:35:32]
CMP: Jack, wait a minute. Let me copy some of this
     down.

[04:10:35:34]
CC:  Okay.

[04:10:35:48]
CMP: Okay. I'm ready now.

[04:10:35:54]
_page : 538
_tape : Tape 72/2
CC:  Okay. We're predicting that you still have
     more water than you need. And one thing we'd
     like for you to do is when you're going to
     sleep up there in the command module take
     a look through the optics and see if you can
     see any stars.

[04:10:36:17]
CMP: Okay, Jack, I will do. Jim and I were able to
     spot constellations from the windows of the [glossary:LM]
     when there's no venting taking place. Could
     you give me some time on these consumables, what
     you're predicting they're good for? I think
     you started to give them times, didn't you, or
     was I just hearing things.

[04:10:36:56]
CC:  We started to give you some times. We think we
     might be able to give you some better ones pretty
     soon. But it looks like your water is good
     through 154 hours, and you've got takusan O<sub>2</sub>
     through 272 hours, plenty of lithium hydroxide,
     and your amp-hours ought to be good through 199
     or 200 hours. Over.

[04:10:37:34]
CMP: Okay; good. Copy that.

[04:10:37:44]
CC:  We expect that your water rate is going to drop
     off and at the time, DELTA will go up to 160 -
     165 hours quite shortly. Another thing we're
     interested in is what's your status on rest and
     medication.

[04:10:38:03]
CMP: Okay. None of us, I know of, had any medications,
     and right now as far as rest, I suppose we're no
     tireder than normally in this situation. I'm
     going to relay the work-sleep cycle.

[04:10:38:20]
CC:  Okay. And don't forget to look through the optics
     when you go up in the command module.

[04:10:38:30]
CMP: (Laughter) Okay. I'll do that.

[04:10:40:04]
CMP: Jack, as luck would have it, we just now started
     to vent a little from the command module ...

[04:10:40:46]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Sorry about that but there's
     too much background noise to read you. I think
     we'll have to wait until you come up on a new
     antenna. Over.

[04:10:40:58]
_page : 539
_tape : Tape 72/3
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. Go ahead now. I think I
     can hear you.

[04:10:41:03]
CMP: Okay. Okay, Jack. I was going to say, as
     luck would have it, the command module picked
     this time to start venting again, so I probably
     won't be able to get a good hack out of stars
     out of the telescope.

[04:10:41:20]
CC:  Okay. Thank you. And if you can think of it,
     when the time comes up, when you're not venting
     how about remembering to take a look through
     them and give us a word?

[04:10:41:31]
CMP: Okay. Will do.

[04:10:44:04]
CMP: Houston, Aquarius.

[04:10:44:24]
CC:  Go ahead. Over.

[04:10:45:01]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Did you call?

[04:10:45:05]
CMP: Yes, Jack. I just got a question. How long are
     you predicting our command module canisters to
     last in here?

[04:10:45:20]
CC:  Okay, Jack. We've got 14 cartridges that'll last
     157 hours, plus we've got the [glossary:LM] primary cartridge
     with 23 hours, and we've got two [glossary:PLSS] cartridges
     with 7 hours apiece.

[04:10:45:35]
CMP: Okay. I was just curious as to how much time
     we've got out of these two cartridges.

[04:10:45:42]
CC:  Stand by 1. I'll get a prediction on that. By
     the way, I hope you're keeping track of the ones
     you've used and the ones you've not.

[04:10:45:51]
CMP: Yes, right now, we have numbers 7 and 8 in the
     [glossary:LM] here.

[04:10:46:00]
CC:  Roger.

[04:10:46:03]
CMP: They were two brand new fresh ones.

[04:10:50:13]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. In regards to the CO<sub>2</sub>
     canisters, by the way the PCO<sub>2</sub> is reading 1.6
     down here now. We expect that we can get 6 more
     hours out of the two canisters that we have
     there - 6 hours at least. However, at 112 hours,
     when we've got several people up, we're going to
     rig up two more and we have the new simplified
     procedure for doing this. However, in the
     meantime, should we need to have a canister
     change, we plan to switch to the [glossary:LM] primary
     canister. Over.

[04:10:50:52]
_page : 540
_tape : Tape 72/4
CMP: Okay. Copy that, Jack.

[04:10:51:08]
CC:  And, Aquarius, how's your [glossary:PTC] holding up?

[04:10:51:14]
CMP: Well, we got a little bit off Jack. The - It
     starts high in the LMP's window and goes low in
     the CDR window.

[04:10:51:37]
CMP: So we've got a little bit of a wobble on it.
     Of course, the command module venting doesn't
     help, either.

[04:11:02:44]
CMP: Houston, Aquarius.

[04:11:02:46]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[04:11:02:50]
CMP: Jack, in reference to your question about the [glossary:PTC],
     on this last complete revolution, the Sun first
     appeared in the very top right corner of the LMP
     window, passed over the CDR window, and was
     visible through the overhead window, and now
     the Moon is - came pretty well through the center
     of both windows this last time.

[04:11:07:20]
CC:  Okay. Thank you, Jack. Copying that.

[04:11:07:23]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We'd like to get a little
     better idea of how [glossary:PTC] is going. So, what
     we'd like for you to do is what we did last time.
     That is to give us a reading on the center of
     the Earth and the center of the Moon on the - [glossary:LPD].

[04:11:07:49]
CMP: On the [glossary:LPD]. Okay, It's shifted. Let's see, the
     Moon's gone by and the Earth didn't come into the
     [glossary:LPD] last time.

[04:11:08:03]
CC:  Okay. But when it goes by the plane of the [glossary:LPD],
     tell us where it was. Okay?

[04:11:08:10]
CMP: Okay. Will do.

[04:11:13:34]
CMP: Okay, Jack. This pass, the Earth came into view
     at the top left-hand corner of the LMP's window
     and was going down. However, when it passed it
     wasn't as high up as the last pass. It did pass
     into view at the CDR window, but too high up to
     get an [glossary:LPD] reading.

[04:11:13:57]
_page : 541
_tape : Tape 72/5
CC: Roger. Understand it went high in both windows
     then.

[04:11:14:04]
CMP: Yes, last time it wasn't even visible in the
     CDR's window; this time it was visible if you
     squatted down, but too high up to get an [glossary:LPD]
     reading.

[04:11:14:14]
CC: Okay, Jack. That's good. Thank you.

[04:11:21:51]
CMP: Okay, Houston; Aquarius.

[04:11:21:53]
CC: Go ahead. Over.

[04:11:21:57]
CMP: Okay. The moon came into view at the middle of
     the LMP's window, passed through the CDR's
     window at an [glossary:LPD] of 5 degrees.

[04:11:22:11]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[04:11:35:55]
CMP: Houston, Aquarius.

[04:11:35:58]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[04:11:36:02]
CMP: Okay, Jack. On this pass, the Earth came into
     the view at the top part of the LMP's window,
     and we got an [glossary:LPD] angle on it as it passed
     through the CDR's window of a minus 4 degrees.

[04:11:36:18]
CC:  Okay. A minus 4. Thank you, Jack - -

[04:11:36:19]
CMP: It's - it's above the - Okay. Are you familiar
     with the minus 4 being halfway through the sky
     part, huh?

[04:11:36:28]

CMP: Okay, Houston; Aquarius.

[04:11:44:47]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[04:11:44:51]
CMP: Okay. On this pass, the Moon came into view at
     the top part of the LMP's window, came across
     higher. Jim estimates the [glossary:LPD] angle at a minus
     15 degrees.

[04:11:45:09]
_page : 542
_tape : Tape 72/6
CC: Okay. A minus 15 on the moon, and sounds like
     it's set up pretty well.

[04:11:45:21]
CMP: Everybody's happy with it down there?

[04:11:45:55]
CC:  Aquarius, it's a little too early to tell exactly
     how the [glossary:PTC] is going. We'd like to get a few
     more points, so keep reading them off, and we're
     still looking for that SUPERCRIT to go anytime.

[04:12:24:08]
CDR: That's right.

[04:12:24:09]
CC:  On the basis of the data we have so far, your
     entry angle is 5.99. The block data we gave
     you on the pad for a no-COMM midcourse-7 last
     night is no longer valid because we made this
     midcourse.

[04:12:24:38]
CDR: Okay. Understand, the no-COMM pad is no longer
     valid because of the midcourse. Entry angle
     based on the last 2 hours' tracking is 5.99,
     and I take it you're going to keep tracking for
     some time now to see whether we need another
     midcourse or not.

[04:12:24:55]
_page : 544
_tape : Tape 73/2
CC:  That's affirmative.

[04:12:25:05]
CDR: Are you planning any no-COMM midcourse at 134
     and change anyway right now, or are you going
     to wait?

[04:12:25:14]
CC: We're discussing that now, Jim, and it looks
     like we're going to wait on the tracking. For
     the time being, since you're in the corridor,
     why, there's no need to pass it up. But we're
     going to keep looking at the tracking, and
     we'll probably come up with one.

[04:12:25:34]
CDR: All right. I'm not too sure what the venting
     is going to do to us so - when this SHe tank
     ruptures, what it's going to do for us.

[04:12:25:47]
CC: Roger. We don't presently expect the SHe tank
     to have any effect on your trajectory, and the
     pressure's up to 1921 now.

CDR: Hey, it's going a lot better than we ever
     expected. What a way to get a data point.

     going out.

[04:12:54:50]
CC:  Can you hear or feel anything?

[04:12:54:54]

     it changed our [glossary:PTC]. Let me check and see what
     the drift is.

[04:12:55:18]
_page : 545
_tape : Tape 73/3
CDR: I think we're probably going to have to
     reestablish [glossary:PTC]. Yes, we got pretty fast yaw drifting,
     Jack.

[04:12:55:57]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius. What are your plans?

[04:12:56:01]
CC: We're thinking about them right now. Did you
     say it yawed some?

[04:12:56:08]
CDR: Yes, I was in a right yaw and now I'm in a left
     yaw; at a much faster rate than the one we put
     in [glossary:PTC].

[04:12:56:28]
CC:  Okay, Jim. We're talking it over. Stand by.

[04:12:57:20]
CDR: What's the SHe tank down to now, Jack?

[04:12:57:24]
CC:  Okay, Jim. It's going through 125 pounds now.
     And we understood you to say - -

[04:12:57:30]
CDR: Okay.

[04:12:57:31]
CC:  - - that it reversed your yaw. Is that affirmative?

[04:12:57:37]
CDR: Sure did, Jack. It reversed my yaw completely
     and put in a little pitch, I think.

[04:12:57:53]
CDR: But more than anything, it reversed my yaw.

[04:12:57:56]
CC:  Roger. Have you effectively established [glossary:PTC]
     in the opposite direction then?

[04:12:58:04]
CDR: Well, you could say that. I'm not too sure
     just what kind of pitch or roll I've got,
     coupled with the yaw. I just saw the Earth go
     by the LMP's window here, not too long ago at
     a rather faster rate than we had going the
     other direction.

[04:12:58:38]
CDR: Perhaps you can tell how fast I'm having to
     shift OMNIs.

[04:12:58:42]
CC:  Yes, we can tell the COMM cycling back and forth.

[04:12:58:52]
CDR: Is that what they call a nonpropulsive vent?

[04:12:58:56]
CC:  Right. I'd hate to see a propulsive one.

[04:12:59:01]
CDR: You and me both.

[04:12:59:04]
_page : 546
_tape : Tape 73/4
CC: It's going through 50 pounds now. So, are you
     seeing fewer sparklies?

[04:12:59:12]
CDR: Yes. Much fewer. Not any at all, now. I'm
     not sure whether that vent gave me reverse yaw
     and roll - left roll - that's - if that's what
     it gave me.

[04:12:59:34]
CC:  You say you think it might have given you some
     left roll as opposed to opposite yaw.

[04:12:59:45]
CDR: I'm sure it gave me the yaw, Jack, but I'm not
     too sure ...

[04:12:59:50]
CC:  Okay. We'd kind of like to watch it, see what
     happens for a little while before we make a
     recommendation. However, we'll need some inputs
     from you on that.

[04:13:00:02]
CDR: Well, we're in no trouble up here as far as -
     as far as the yaw goes. Everything's fine.
     It's faster than we had set up before. We just
     wanted to get into proper thermal constraint,
     and it's going to take me 15 minutes to get the
     thrusters up anyway.

[04:13:00:58]
CC:  Okay, Skipper. We don't see any thermal problems
     as a result of this change. If we see some
     communications problems, we may have to do
     something different, but so far, so good. And
     we'd kind of like to hear from you on [glossary:LPD] numbers, if you get anything going by the window.

[04:13:01:28]
CDR: Okay. Will do.

[04:13:02:03]
CMP: Okay, Jack. The Earth just went through at
     an [glossary:LPD] of 26 degrees.

[04:13:02:09]
CC:  Okay. The Earth went through at 26 degrees
     going the opposite direction this time - left
     to right. Is that right?

[04:13:02:17]
CMP: From left to right. That's affirmative.

[04:13:02:32]
CC: Of course, the only other thing that we'd be
     concerned about is what change in your velocity
     this might have had and what DELTA-V it imparted,
     and we'll have to look at that for a while before
     we are able to determine it. And, if there is
     no significant change, why, we prefer just to
     leave it the way it is.

[04:13:02:54]
_page : 547
_tape : Tape 73/5
CMP: Okay, Jack. We're going to get a time on a
     revolution here, and maybe that'll help you out.

[04:13:03:02]
CC:  Right. And, for your information, the tank went
     at 1937.

[04:13:03:11]
CDR: That's two thousand - 1937?

[04:13:03:14]
CC:  Right.

[04:13:04:12]
CMP: Okay, Jack. The Earth went through again at
     18 degrees on the [glossary:LPD].

[04:13:04:19]
CC:  Okay. Earth at 18. Thank you.

[04:13:04:23]
CMP: Okay. And we didn't see the Moon that time.

[04:13:05:41]
CMP: Okay, Jack. The Moon went through that time
     at 32 degrees on the [glossary:LPD].

[04:13:05:46]
CC:  Roger. Moon at 32. Thanks.

[04:13:08:27]
CMP: Okay, Jack. Well, we didn't get the Earth that
     time. The Moon came back through at about
     10 degrees, and now we're getting to the Earth
     again. Stand by.

[04:13:09:08]
CMP: Okay. The Earth came through the [glossary:LPD] at
     62 degrees that time. And the total time for
     the two revolutions, - I missed the Earth
     revolution before, but the total time for the
     Earth's two revolutions was 3 minutes and
     50 seconds.

[04:13:09:33]
CC:  Say again the time and the - and also the [glossary:LPD]
     number. You're in the background noise, Jack.

[04:13:09:39]
CMP: Okay. Okay, Jack. [glossary:LPD] that time was 62 degrees
     and that was for two revolutions, being at that
     distance we missed the Earth - The time before
     we didn't see it. And the time was 3 minutes
     and 50 seconds.

[04:13:09:59]
CC:  Okay. Three minutes and 50 seconds. Is that
     rate uncomfortable for you?

[04:13:10:34]
CMP: Jack, Jim said it isn't uncomfortable. It's
     a little annoying as for the OMNI switching,
     and also he said it's kind of - He said this
     Earth/Moon relationship's kind of ... because
     he doesn't know when to ...

[04:13:10:50]
_page : 548

CC:  Roger.

[04:13:13:30]
CMP: Okay, Jack. We've got a MASTER ALARM and we've
     got a battery light flickering.

[04:13:13:36]
CC:  Okay. Copy a battery light. What battery?

[04:13:14:16]
CC:  Aquarius, how about cycling the power temp
     monitor to find out which battery it is, please.

[04:13:14:25]
LMP: Yes. That's in work, Joe.

[04:13:14:39]
LMP: Okay. It's that same old ...

[04:13:14:54]
CC: Okay, Fred. I can hear you now, Say again,
     please.

[04:13:15:01]
LMP: Okay. It's the same old - same old one. The
     only light I'm getting is on BAT 2.

[04:13:15:35]
CC: Okay, Fred. We copy your same old friend,
     battery 2. Could you give us high bit rate
     for a while, please?

[04:13:16:13]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. High bit rate, please.

[04:13:16:19]
LMP: How you getting it now, Jack?

[04:13:16:23]
CC:  We got it.

[04:13:20:54]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. You can go low bit rate, POWER
     AMP, OFF and DOWN VOICE BACKUP now. Voltages
     and currents look normal on battery 2; so ignore
     the battery light.

[04:13:21:12]
CMP: Okay, Jack. POWER AMP, OFF, back to low bit
     rate, and I'll go back to sleep.

[04:13:21:21]
CC:  The battery light staying on?

[04:13:21:30]
CMP: Yes. We got a steady on BAT 2, BAT FAULT LIGHT
     and the battery caution light.

[04:13:21:49]
CC:  Okay. And the Skipper in the sack now?

[04:13:21:56]
CMP: Say again?

[04:13:21:57]
CC:  Is the Skipper in the sack now?

[04:13:22:08]
CMP: Okay. Hold on a minute, Jack.

[04:13:24:24]
_extra : END OF TAPE
CC: Okay, Jim. Since the antenna switch is kind of
     annoying, we've talked them into buying only
     half of the data. If it gets too troublesome
     for you to switch antennas, why, just leave it
     on one antenna and we'll listen to you half of
     the time.

[04:13:24:43]
_page : 550
_tape : Tape 74/1
CDR: Okay. It's not really much trouble. That's all
     we're doing about it. We'll try to keep up with
     it. And you're satisfied with this attitude so
     far. I guess you're going to watch the thermal
     and find out whether perhaps we're going to some
     other [glossary:PTC] attitude.

[04:13:24:55]
CC:  Roger. Thermal appears to be no problem. We're
     looking at what DELTA-V might have been imparted
     due to this, and it looks like we're not going
     to change the [glossary:PTC] attitude.

[04:13:25:14]
CDR: Okay. Then DELTA-V was a part of it; I hope it
     raised that angle a little bit.

[04:13:25:44]
CC:  Yes. We'll be looking at the data here, and
     give you a better answer in next 30 minutes or
     so.

[04:13:25:52]
CDR: Okay. Meanwhile, back to the drawing board
     about nonpropulsive vents.

[04:13:26:06]
CC:  And, with your kind of luck, it probably lowered
     the angle some more.

[04:13:26:13]
CDR: Thanks for the confidence.

[04:13:26:43]
CC:  And, Jim, we're going to have a handover here
     pretty soon, about 3 minutes, we may lose uplink
     for 30 seconds or a minute.

[04:13:26:54]
CDR: Okay.

[04:13:30:30]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We're handed over. How do
     you read?

[04:13:30:36]
CDR: Read you loud and clear, Jack.

[04:13:30:42]
CC:  Okay. I'm hearing you now, and the noise has
     come up again, but it will go down.

[04:13:30:52]
CDR: How do you read now?

[04:13:30:53]
CC:  Okay. That's a lot better, and we figure your
     battery glitch was just that thermal switch
     triggered a mal - a CAUTION and WARNING, just
     cycled once, and triggered a MASTER ALARM again.
     We'll watch the batteries for you, since you
     don't have any CAUTION and WARNING on now.

[04:13:31:13]
_page : 551
_tape : Tape 74/2
CDR: Okay. Appreciate that.

[04:13:43:33]
CC:  Okay, Jim. Your luck is holding. Tracking shows
     that your entry angle has gone up to minus 6.24.
     This is on the basis of all the data we've collected between the midcourse up to the time the
     SHe tank went. So we'll continue to look at it,
     and see if SHe tank did anything to it at all.
     So it's - The data has gone from 5.9 to a
     minus 6.24.

[04:13:44:07]
CDR: That sounds pretty good. We're really getting
     in there.

[04:14:00:53]
CC: How are you doing, Jim?

[04:14:00:59]
CDR: Not bad. Not bad at all.

[04:14:01:10]
CC:  Is Jack in the sack, or is he with you?

[04:14:01:16]
CDR: Jack and Fred both are going to sleep. It's sort
     of humorous; Fred's sleeping place now is in the
     tunnel, upside down with his head resting on the
     ascent engine. Jack is on the floor of the [glossary:LM],
     with a restraint ... wrapped around his arm to
     keep him down there.

[04:14:01:39]
CC:  You say Jack is on the floor, and Fred is with
     his head on the ascent engine.

[04:14:01:46]
CDR: That's right, with his feet up into the tunnel.

[04:14:08:18]
CC:  Okay, Skipper. Your luck is really hanging in
     there. Your water's good up to 161 hours now.

[04:14:08:26]
CDR: Hey, that sounds great.

[04:14:08:40]
CC:  That doesn't include [glossary:PLSS] water or command module
     water.

[04:14:08:49]
CDR: Okay. Jack, I'd just like to know what - what
     plans or thoughts being contemplated for the
     [glossary:PLSS]s or the [glossary:OPS], whether we're going to use
     their LiOH canisters or take the devices back in
     the command module with us, or just what will be
     your plans.

[04:14:09:15]
CC:  Yes. We're talking all that over now. We
     haven't decided.

[04:14:09:22]
_page : 552
_tape : Tape 74/3
CDR: Okay.

[04:14:14:58]
CC: Everything's running real smooth over in Timber
     Cove, Jim.

[04:14:15:05]
CDR: Sounds pretty good. How about at El Lago?

[04:14:15:11]
CC:  Same. Everything's smooth there, too.

[04:14:15:16]
CDR: Good.

[04:14:23:19]
CC:  Jim, we've had a lot of people working on the
     entry procedures, and they'll be continuing to
     do so. We got a few ideas we'd like to toss at
     you so you can start thinking about them if you
     think you're in a position to discuss them without waking up the other guys. What do you think?

[04:14:23:36]
CDR: Yes, go ahead. It's okay.

[04:14:23:40]
CC: Okay. One of the first things we want to do is
     charge the battery in [glossary:CSM], so we can get some
     [glossary:LM] power over there to do that, and we have procedures ginned up to do it. In regards to
     reentry, we're planning our last midcourse at
     5 hours before entry interface, and, if we have
     to make one, that is. And then we'd like to
     jettison the service module at 4 hours and a
     half, roughly, before entry interface, and take
     the next 3 to 3-1/2 hours for taking pictures,
     cranking up the command module G&N, taking care
     of stowage, and other odds and ends. And we'd
     hang on to the [glossary:LM] until 1 hour before entry
     interface, and then we'd jettison that. And
     these procedures are going to be run integrated
     in the CMS and LMS tomorrow morning, and, hopefully, later on in the day, we'll do it again
     with Mission Control on the loop. A couple of
     other things we'd like to toss at you: one
     question is what do we do with the [glossary:OPS]. The
     thought is that there is adequate O<sub>2</sub> in the
     command module and that the [glossary:OPS] represents high
     pressure source and a stowage problem, and people
     are thinking about leaving them in the [glossary:LM]. The
     other thing is that we think you might want to
     make this a suited entry, suiting up prior to
     [glossary:LM] jettison, because what we're doing is, when
     we jettison the [glossary:LM], we're going to do it like
     we did in Apollo 10 - just let the beauty go,
     and if we weren't suited, why, we'd be betting
     on the hatch seal to take care of us. So we
     thought we'd toss these few ideas at you. Some
     of them are ones that are particularly pertinent
     questions at this time.

[04:14:25:46]
_page : 553
_tape : Tape 74/4
CDR: Okay. A suited entry would sort of ... the
     1-hour [glossary:LM] jettison back and ... back and forth
     up to that time. ... impede our progress back
     and forth. ...

[04:14:26:10]
CC:  We're losing you, Jim

[04:14:26:13]
CDR: Okay. I think I've got you back. I guess the
     midcourse at 5 hours prior to ...

[04:14:26:25]
CC: Affirmative, Jim. Midcourse 5 hours prior to
     entry interface.

[04:14:26:35]
CDR: If that's the case, all I'm worried about is
     having that all squared away. It's long before
     that ... I want everything in its place. All
     the stowage cleared away, all the ... ready to
     go and know exactly what to do and ... so that
     we can do the midcourse, and ... get into the
     command module ... jettison the service module,
     and then know exactly how to get into the [glossary:LM].

[04:14:27:13]
CC:  Roger. All those procedures will work - will be
     worked out precisely, and we agree that the
     stowage and all of those peripheral details ought
     to be taken care of before midcourse.

[04:14:27:31]
CDR: And, I guess, that last midcourse, we'd want to
     start looking at midcourse fairly early, if we
     have the power to do so, mainly because of attitude control. This last time was fairly easy,
     but I'm not too sure how long we can continue
     to ...

[04:14:28:09]
CDR: I have ... in, and it seems about as cold as it
     is now, we'll probably be going into suits long
     before entry.

[04:14:28:22]
CC:  Yes. That's what we were thinking.

[04:14:28:50]
_page : 554
_tape : Tape 74/5
CC:  I guess the two things which are somewhat unresolved at the moment are what to do with the [glossary:OPS]
     and what to do about the suited entry. We
     thought we'd toss those at you to see what you
     thought about them.

[04:14:29:06]
CDR: Okay. As far as the [glossary:OPS] is concerned, we have
     enough oxygen in the spacecraft ... to get us
     through. I have no ... command module ... suit
     loop prior to entry. I was looking at ... [glossary:OPS]
     ... sources of oxygen ... also in the - in the
     front of the suit loop or ... circulate ...

[04:14:30:06]
CC:  Jim, I'm sorry. We're not catching what you're
     saying. The COMM is getting kind of bad right
     now.

[04:14:30:15]
CDR: Okay, Jack. How do you read now?

[04:14:30:18]
CC:  I've still got you with quite a bit of background
     noise, but if you talk up like that, I think we
     can hear you.

[04:14:30:26]
CDR: Okay. My only concern about leaving the [glossary:OPS]
     and/or the [glossary:PLSS] in the command module is how
     soon do we have to live off the command module
     consumables prior to entry, and the [glossary:PLSS] has a
     fan and has a lithium hydroxide ... use the command module system. Also, the [glossary:OPS] ... right
     now ... command module ... command module oxygen
     and electrical power is ... but I had just as
     soon be ... back in the [glossary:LM].

[04:14:31:10]
CC:  It sounds like the general gist of your comments
     are that if things remain pretty much as they
     are now in the command module, you'd just as soon
     leave the [glossary:OPS] in the [glossary:LM]. Is that affirm?

[04:14:31:24]
CDR: That's affirm.

[04:14:31:31]
CC:  Okay. And maybe you'd like to think over the
     suited entry bit a little while.

[04:14:31:40]
CDR: Okay.

[04:14:32:01]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[04:14:32:02]
CC:  Go ahead.

[04:14:32:06]
_page : 555
_tape : Tape 74/6
CDR: Okay ... How we aline the command module right
     for entry, especially if you have the [glossary:LM] in
     back. Over.

[04:14:32:21]
CC:  Roger. That's one subject that's been getting
     a lot of attention, and let me see if I can get
     some general ideas on that at the moment.

[04:14:32:33]
CDR: Okay.

[04:14:35:36]
CC: Jim, I can give you the general idea of the
     proposed procedure for bringing the command
     module G&N up. It's the presently proposed one.
     We may come up with a better one, but here's
     what we're looking at right now. First thing we
     plan to do is to - using the [glossary:LM] [glossary:COAS], sight on
     the Earth with the [glossary:LM] just as we did in the midcourse. Then we'll do a body-axis aline, 400
     plus 5 on the ACS, to put the [glossary:AGS] ball at 000.
     And then we can give you an [glossary:AGS] ball attitude to
     fly to, to point the [glossary:CSM] optics at the Moon.
     And, if you can see stars, why, we can use those
     too. Then we can give you an equivalent set of
     CDU angles to put into [glossary:NOUN 20] and to torque the
     platform over. So, now we're coarse alined.
     Then we do a fine aline by shooting at the Moon
     and then at the Sun. Do you follow all that?

[04:14:37:05]
CDR: Okay, Jack. Let me see if I have it. What we
     do is point the [glossary:LM] at the Earth as we did for
     the midcourse [glossary:COAS], and we do a body-axis aline
     on the [glossary:AGS]. Then you give us an [glossary:AGS] ball attitude to fly to. ... the [glossary:LM], and then we ...
     point the ... at the Moon. Then you would update
     the - give us some CDUs to coarse aline. ...
     fine aline ... on stars or the Moon or the Earth.
     Stand by. Okay. We had another MASTER ALARM,
     Jack. I don't see any lights down there, except
     the battery light's still there. You want - -
     ... display [glossary:ECS]. Okay. And the number 2 battery
     still has a light on it. I suspect it may be the
     same problem that we had before ... ...

[04:14:38:30]
CC:  Okay. Let us talk it over a second, and we'll
     tell you what to do.

[04:14:39:00]
CC:  Jim, is the battery light kind of flickering?

[04:14:39:06]
CDR: Yes. That's affirm, Jack.

[04:14:39:16]
_page : 556
_tape : Tape 74/7
CDR: Yes. The battery light's flickering, and it
     triggers off the MASTER ALARM.

[04:14:39:21]
CC:  Okay. Well, that - temperature sensor on battery 2 is kind of cycling back and forth and
     every time it does, it triggers a MASTER ALARM,
     Jim.

[04:14:39:37]
CDR: Okay. Same old problem, huh?

[04:14:39:39]
CC:  Yes.

[04:14:40:13]
CC:  And, Jim, finally on the [glossary:P52], we're considering
     using the - the Moon and then the Sun for the fine aline.

[04:14:40:24]
CDR: Okay. The Moon and the Sun for the fine aline.
     Understand. We'll go through this again here ...

[04:14:40:55]
CDR: Okay, Jack. Once - Once I get the spacecraft at
     the proper attitude ...

[04:14:41:22]
CC:  Jim, I didn't copy your last question due to
     background noise.

[04:14:41:29]
CDR: Okay. Once - Once you get the [glossary:AGS] ball alined
     ... command module ...

[04:14:41:49]
CC:  After we do the body axis aline on the [glossary:AGS], we
     can tell you what attitude on the [glossary:AGS] ball to
     fly to in order to point the [glossary:CSM] optics at the
     Moon or at some star. And then we can, knowing
     where the optics are pointed, give you an equivalent set of CDU angles to put in [glossary:NOUN 20] to
     torque the platform.

[04:14:42:22]
CDR: Okay. I see.

[04:14:42:30]
CC:  That's the current thinking. It may change
     between now and tomorrow, but right now, that's
     the way it looks, Jim. It'll probably be some
     take-off on that anyway.

[04:14:42:43]
CDR: Okay. Are they planning on a G&N entry or using
     another system, like [glossary:EMS] or something like that?

[04:14:42:54]
CC:  It will be a G&N entry.

[04:14:43:01]
CDR: Nothing like going first class.

[04:14:43:06]
CC:  Yes. That'll be a switch, won't it?

[04:14:46:00]
_page : 557
_tape : Tape 74/8
CC:  Jim, are you broken into the food locker in the
     [glossary:LM] yet?

[04:14:46:06]
CDR: That's affirm, Jack. I sure have. ... away.

[04:14:46:14]
CC:  You say you did find everything in order in
     there, huh?

[04:14:46:20]
CDR: Yes, everything was great.

[04:14:46:22]
CC:  Okay. I'll pass it.

[04:14:46:40]
CC:  I had a question about that earlier.

[04:14:46:46]
CDR: Right.

[04:14:48:13]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[04:14:48:16]
CC:  Go ahead.

[04:14:48:19]
CDR: I understand that one of your reasons for a
     suited entry is the fact that the command module
     hatch ... hasn't been good. It doesn't seem to
     be any different, but in the other ... our hatch
     is no better than other spacecraft.

[04:14:48:58]
CC:  No, the situation, Jim, is that your hatch is
     as good as any other hatch but that we won't
     have a chance to verify it until so late in the
     game, like 1 hour before entry interface, in this
     case; whereas before, why, we had a chance to
     evaluate it in lunar orbit. Over.

[04:14:49:23]
CDR: Oh, okay.

[04:14:49:27]
CC:  And that might make your time line a little too
     crowded, getting your suits on there at the last
     minute; say, less than an hour before entry
     interface.

[04:14:49:44]
CDR: Okay.

[04:14:50:30]
CC: Jim, the next action item we want to pursue is
     transferring some [glossary:LM] power up to the command
     module MAIN B so we can start charging battery,
     and I guess what we ought to do is start on that
     one when somebody else gets up to help you there.
     So, when you decide to get the other guys up, or
     to have someone help, why, let us know and we'll
     start working on that.

[04:14:51:03]
_page : 558
_tape : Tape 74/9
CDR: Okay. I'll let you have Jack, and Fred's ...
     When in the time line ...?

[04:14:51:18]
CC: Say again, Jim. I didn't catch that.

[04:14:51:28]
CDR: When in our time - What's the [glossary:GET] do you plan
     on ...

[04:14:52:07]
CC:  Jim, I didn't catch all of what you said, but I
     think you wanted to know when the procedures [on]
     entry are going to be available and read up to
     you. If that's the case, why, we're talking
     about 120 hours or so. As far as the - charging
     battery A, we want to do that as soon as the
     other guys get up to help you. We've already
     passed up some of that procedure, and we have a
     couple of DELTAs to it.

[04:14:52:37]
CDR: Roger. Jack's already up. He asked ... curious
     when you wanted to do it. Did you understand
     that? ... Is that correct?

[04:14:53:00]
CC:  Jim, we're having trouble hearing you. The next
     order of business is to charge battery A, and
     when you get somebody to help you there, why,
     we'll go ahead and get done with it.

[04:14:53:13]
CDR: Okay. Sounds good.

[04:14:53:17]
CC:  And, before you start working on it let us know,
     because we've got some DELTAs to the battery
     charging procedure.

[04:14:53:26]
CDR: Roger. I'm putting Jack on the line now to copy
     down the DELTAs ...

[04:14:53:54]
CMP: ...

[04:14:54:02]
CC: Aquarius, did you call?

[04:14:54:06]
CMP: Yes, Jack. I'm on the line. ...

[04:14:54:17]
CC:  Okay. Go ahead now. I can hear better.

[04:14:54:22]
CMP: Okay, Jack. Joe Kerwin passed me up the procedure for powering the [glossary:CSM] from the [glossary:LM]. Has it
     changed?

[04:14:54:32]
CC:  Yes. If you'll get that out, I'll read you the
     DELTAs.

[04:14:54:42]
_page : 559
_tape : Tape 74/10
CMP: Okay. I've got it.

[04:14:54:47]
CC:  Okay, The second step was in the [glossary:LM] circuit
     breakers panel 11 and 16: ASCENT ECA CONTROL,
     close, two of them. Cross that out. In the
     next line, we had BATTERY 5 NORMAL FEED, on;
     cross out BATTERY 5 and put BATTERY 6 in there.
     In the next line was - -

[04:14:55:17]
CMP: ... Jack ... Hey, Jack; I have for step 3, I
     have BAT 5 and BAT 6 NORMAL FEED, on. You just
     want BAT 6?

[04:14:55:30]
CC:  That's affirmative. Just BAT 6, Jack. And the
     next line, you had BATTERY 1 and 3. Make that
     BATTERY 1, 2, 3, and 4. Just add BATs 2 and 4.
     All four descent BATs. And then the next two
     lines about waiting 30 minutes, cross that out.
     And the next line about BATTERIES 2 and 4 OFF/RESET,
     cross that out, too.

[04:14:56:09]
CC:  And, Jack, the - -

[04:14:56:10]
CMP: Okay. Let me read -

[04:14:56:12]
CC:  Go ahead.

[04:14:56:14]
CMP: Let me read you all the steps as I've got them,
     Jack, and make sure we've got them right. ...
     ASCENT ECA, two, closed. Step 2 will now be
     BAT 6, NORMAL FEED, on. Step 3, BATS 1, 2, 3,
     and 4, OFF/RESET.

[04:14:56:44]
CC:  Okay. That part's all right, Jack. And we
     had - about 11 or 12 steps for the command module. They go as is with no change. And then we
     had a couple of more procedures for the [glossary:LM].
     Stand by 1.

[04:14:57:12]
CMP: Okay. Jack, let me read you command module procedures just to make sure I have them right,
     also.

[04:14:57:18]
CC:  Okay. Go ahead with the command module
     procedures.

[04:14:57:23]
_extra : END OF TAPE
CMP: Okay. Connect [glossary:LM] and [glossary:CSM] umbilicals. Step 2,
     panel 5: [glossary:LM] POWER 1 AC and 2 AC, closed, circuit
     breakers. Step 3, panel 5: [glossary:EPS] SENSOR SIGNAL,
     MAIN B, closed. Step 4, panel ... closed. Then
     there's step 5: MAIN B BAT BUS B, closed.
     Verify MAIN BUS voltage, then switch the [glossary:LM]
     power to [glossary:CSM]. Step 7: CB MAIN B BAT BUS B,
     open. And on panel 250, BAT POWER ENTRY and
     POSTLANDING, open. Verify MAIN BUS voltage.

[04:14:58:49]
_page : 561
_tape : Tape 75/1
CC: Okay, Jack. The [glossary:CSM] procedure's okay, and then
     we had to go back to the [glossary:LM] and do something.
     And the first line is okay, cross out "BAT 5
     and 6 OFF," delete that. And delete the next
     line also, that says "Panel 11 to 16 ASCENT ECA
     CONTROL, open." Then we had a couple of notes
     which remain the same. Go ahead.

[04:14:59:20]
CMP: Okay. I didn't get the notes, but I'll read
     you the steps as I have them now. One step,
     BAT 1, 2, 3, and 4 ... and at this point should
     have BATTERIES 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 ON. Is that
     affirmative?

[04:14:59:39]
CC: That's affirmative. So now we have BAT 1, 2,
     3, 4, and 6, ON, and I got two notes. Number 1
     is: your circuit breaker protection limits -
     your circuit breaker protection - limits the
     current to 15 amps. Number 2 note is: now the
     umbilical between the [glossary:LM] and the command module
     is hot. And the MAIN BUS voltage can be monitored by selecting MAIN B.

[04:15:00:46]
CMP: Okay, Jack. These notes are: circuit breaker
     protection limits current to 15 amps. The tube,
     the umbilical between the [glossary:CSM] and [glossary:LM] is hot.
     I can monitor MAIN B for the bus voltage.

[04:15:01:04]
CC:  That's affirm, Jack.

[04:15:01:22]
CMP: Okay, Jack. One question here. If we transfer
     power like this, we're not going to cut us short
     on power remaining in the [glossary:CSM] ..., are we ...?

[04:15:01:37]
CC:  Say it again, Jack. I didn't get it.

[04:15:01:43]
CMP: Okay. Stand by. If we configure the [glossary:CSM] for
     powering up the [glossary:LM], we aren't going to cut it
     short on [glossary:LM] power requirements to get us back
     in the entry interface, are we?

[04:15:02:03]
CC:  That's a negative, Jack. According to the latest
     update, we've got ampere-hours out to 203 hours.

[04:15:02:20]
CMP: Stand by. ...

[04:15:02:40]
CMP: Okay, Jack. One question from Jim is, he wants
     to know whether the procedure has been tried ...

[04:15:03:04]
_page : 562
_tape : Tape 75/2
CC: Okay. Try it again, now, Jack. What did Jim
     want to know?

[04:15:03:10]
CMP: Okay. He would like to know whether the procedure has been tried and whether it has been
     found to be okay; and there's no danger of
     shorting out any of our batteries or anything
     we have on board the [glossary:LM] now.

[04:15:04:20]
CC:  Okay, Jack. This procedure has not been tried
     out as such; however, the hardware paths
     through which the current flows are the same
     ones which we used during translunar trajectory,
     and there's not a problem with shorting out a
     descent battery. Over.

[04:15:04:47]
CMP: Okay. I'll relay that to Jim.

[04:15:05:09]
CC:  Jack, of course, the reason for all of this is
     that we see we're 20 amp-hours short on one of
     the entry batteries, and we've got to juice
     that up to get you home with.

[04:15:05:25]
CMP: Okay.

[04:15:05:30]
CC: Okay. What we owe you from here on out is the
     actual battery A charge procedure, and then a
     procedure to turn this all around, again.

[04:15:05:48]
CMP: Okay. Do you have it there, and how long is
     it ...

[04:15:06:15]
CC:  Okay, Jack. I have the procedure in front of
     me. It's about 18 steps, and the reason it's
     so long is because we're starting from this
     basic configuration which we gave you earlier.
     It concerns a charge on battery A, of course,
     which is our low one. So, when you're ready
     to copy it, let me know.

[04:15:06:40]
CMP: Okay. Let's go at it.

[04:15:06:46]
CC:  Okay. Are you ready to read - copy it?

[04:15:06:53]
CMP: Go ahead.

[04:15:06:54]
CC: Okay. On panel 250, circuit breaker BAT A,
     POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, close; on panel 275,
     circuit breaker INVERTER POWER 2, MAIN B, close.
     Next several circuit breakers are on panel 5;
     circuit breaker BAT RELAY BUS, BAT A, close;
     circuit breaker [glossary:EPS] SENSOR UNIT, AC BUS 2,
     close; CB [glossary:EPS] SENSOR SIGNAL, AC2, close; CB
     BATTERY CHARGER, MAIN B, close. Are you still
     with me?

[04:15:08:28]
_page : 563
_tape : Tape 75/3
CMP: Okay, Jack. I'll read back those steps you
     gave me so far. Panel 250 CB BAT A, POWER
     ENTRY/POSTLANDING, close, panel 275, CB 
     INVERTER POWER 2, MAIN B, close; panel 5, CB BAT
     RELAY BUS, BAT A, close; CB [glossary:EPS] SENSOR UNIT,
     AC BUS 2, close; CB [glossary:EPS] SENSOR SIGNAL, AC2,
     close, CB BAT CHARGER, MAIN B, close.

[04:15:09:06]
CC:  Okay. Good readback, Jack. The only one is
     number 1 - number 4. I didn't get your 
     readback, but it's [glossary:EPS] SENSOR UNIT AC BUS 2, close.
     You got that?

[04:15:09:22]
CMP: Yes. I read that back CB [glossary:EPS] SENSOR UNIT, close.

[04:15:09:30]
CC:  Okay. To continue - to continue on - the same
     panel, panel 5: circuit breaker, BATTERY CHARGER,
     AC POWER, close; circuit breaker BATTERY CHARGER,
     BAT A CHARGE, close; circuit breaker INVERTER
     CONTROL 2, close; circuit breaker INVERTER 
     CONTROL 3, close; I've got a switch for you, MAIN
     BUS TIE, BAT A/C, OFF; and another switch,
     BATTERY CHARGE to AC2. Read those back.

[04:15:10:51]
CMP: Okay, Jack. CB BAT CHARGER to AC POWER, close.
     Stand by. Okay. I had to get a light here.
     CB BAT CHARGER, BAT A CHARGE, close; CB INVERTER
     CONTROL 2, close; CB INVERTER CONTROL 3, close;
     the two switches, MAIN BUS TIE, BAT A/C, OFF;
     and the second one, BAT CHARGER TO AC2.

[04:15:11:30]
CC:  How about reaching over there on your right-hand
     side and turning the BIOMED off? See if we can
     improve the COMM a little bit.

[04:15:12:02]
CMP: Okay. How do you read, now?

[04:15:12:03]
CC:  Okay. I'm reading you real good now, and I want
     to verify that the main bus tie that we switched OFF was BAT Alfa Charlie.

[04:15:12:15]
CMP: That's verified; MAIN BUS TIE, BAT Alfa Charlie,
     OFF. And that should ...

[04:15:12:22]
_page : 564
_tape : Tape 75/4
CC: Okay. And in panel 3, I've got a switch for you.
     AC INVERTER 2 to MAIN B.

[04:15:12:39]
CMP: Okay. AC INVERTER 2 to MAIN B.

[04:15:12:42]
CC:  Okay. And switch INVERTER 2, AC BUS 2 to on;
     and another switch, AC BUS 2 RESET, to reset
     and center; switch BATTERY CHARGE to Alfa;
     switch DC INDICATOR select BAT CHARGER; and then
     what we want you to do is to report the charger
     current and voltage to [glossary:MSFN] every 10 minutes for
     the first half hour, and then once every
     30 minutes after that. And that'll be on our
     call, Jack. Read back the switches that I just
     gave you.

[04:15:13:58]
CMP: Okay, Jack. It's panel 3, AC INVERTER 2, MAIN B;
     INVERTER 2, AC BUS 2, on; AC BUS 2 RESET to reset
     and center; BAT CHARGER to A, AC INDICATOR select
     to BAT CHARGER. Report amps and volts to [glossary:MSFN]
     every 10 minutes for the first 30 minutes, and
     then every 30 minutes on a [glossary:MSFN] call.

[04:15:14:29]
CC: Okay. That's a good readback, Jack. Now the
     only thing we owe you is a turnaround from this,
     which we will have.

[04:15:14:40]
CMP: Okay. Let me ask one question, here. About
     how long do you think it'll take to charge
     these batteries?

[04:15:14:45]
CC:  It's going to take you about 15 hours.

[04:15:15:09]
CMP: Jack, about how many amperes of [glossary:LM] power will
     this 15 hours ...?

[04:15:15:21]
CC:  Stand by. We'll get it for you - -

[04:15:15:22]
CMP: How many, Jack?

[04:15:15:26]
CMP: Okay. He got it. He got the question.

[04:15:15:49]
CC:  Okay, Jack. That's going to take 120 amp-hours
     out of the [glossary:LM], which is equivalent to 10 hours,
     which will put us back to 193 hours, and that's plenty.

[04:15:16:07]
CMP: Okay. Let me relay that to Jim here. It'll
     be 120 amp hours, which leaves us - which puts
     us back from 203 hours ... to 193 hours.

[04:15:16:20]
_page : 565
_tape : Tape 75/5
LMP: Yes, there's that much to spare.

[04:15:16:35]
LMP: Okay, Jack. One question here. If we have any
     problems setting up this [glossary:LM] power to the [glossary:CSM],
     is the quickest way to get out of it, return to
     the normal configuration, as it is for me to
     just switch the LM POWER to [glossary:CSM] to RESET then OFF?

[04:15:16:57]
CC:  Stand by 1.

[04:15:17:02]
CMP: I would like to give one quick step in case that
     gave Jim report some sort of problem for us to
     get out of it quickly.

[04:15:17:11]
CC:  Okay. Let us talk it over for a minute, Jack.

[04:15:17:16]
CMP: Okay. Real fine. And while you guys are 
     talking it over, you might read back - have you got
     the procedure for reversing this? I'll copy that.

[04:15:20:00]
CMP: Okay, Jack. Are you with me?

[04:15:20:03]
CC:  Yes. We're still here, Jack. What we want to
     do is follow you through on this, so we're going
     to get high bit rate to do it. In answer to
     your question, to undo this procedure quickly,
     in the event a problem develops, be sure that
     you don't touch the 124 POWER switch because it's
     got a RESET position. But the way to undo it
     is go into the [glossary:CSM] and on panel 5 open two
     circuit breakers. And they're some of the first
     ones we read to you. Open [glossary:LM] POWER-1 MAIN B,
     and open [glossary:LM] POWER-2 MAIN B. You copy that?

[04:15:20:45]
CMP: Okay. Understand. If I want to get out of
     this real quickly, I have to open just two
     circuit breakers in the [glossary:CSM]; that's on panel 5,
     [glossary:LM] POWER-1 MAIN B, [glossary:LM] POWER-2 MAIN B.

[04:15:20:58]
CC:  Okay. And before you go ahead with this, let's
     establish high bit rate and wait 1 on that. And
     then as we go through the procedure we want you
     to wait when you get power on MAIN B so we can
     take a look at MAIN B without any loads on it
     before we start charging the batteries.

[04:15:21:31]
CMP: Okay. I understand you want high bit rate on
     the LM or [glossary:CSM] just before we start this?

[04:15:21:40]
_page : 566
_tape : Tape 75/6
CC: That will be high bit rate on the [glossary:LM], and stand by for it.

[04:15:21:45]
CMP: Okay.

[04:15:21:52]
CC:  Okay, Jack. Before we go ahead with this, what
     we want to do is read you the reverse - the
     normal reverse procedure.

[04:15:22:00]
CMP: Okay. I'm ready to copy.

[04:15:22:56]
CC:  Okay, Jack. I got the start on how you reverse
     this procedure. Ready to copy?

[04:15:23:04]
CMP: Go ahead, Jack.

[04:15:23:06]
CC: Okay. First you want to reverse the battery
     charge procedure. To do that, on panel 3,
     switch BATTERY CHARGE, off; AC INVERTER 2, off;
     panel 5, MAIN BUS TIE BAT Alfa Charlie, on, up;
     panel 250, circuit breaker BAT Alfa, POWER
     ENTRY, and POSTLANDING, open. Read back.

[04:15:23:59]
CMP: Okay, Jack. On panel 3, BATTERY CHARGER, off,
     AC INVERTER 2, off; on panel 5, MAIN BUS TIE
     Alfa Charlie, on; panel 250, CB BAT A, POWER
     ENTRY and POSTLANDING, open.

[04:15:24:23]
CC: That's affirmative, Jack, and then if you'll
     go back to the rest of the circuit breakers on
     that list, and just opposite - Open them all up.
     Stand by 1.

[04:15:24:52]
CC:  Okay, Jack. Go back to the battery charge 
     procedure I gave you. And, in order to terminate
     charge, just - You'll just have to write "Open"
     or "Off" next to the circuit switch that I gave
     you. So on panel 250, that circuit breaker
     you've already opened; on panel 275, INVERTER
     POWER-2 MAIN B, open; panel 5, BAT RELAY BUS
     BAT A, open; [glossary:EPS] SENSOR UNIT AC BUS 2, open,
     [glossary:EPS] SENSOR SIGNAL AC2, open; BATTERY CHARGER,
     MAIN B, open; BATTERY CHARGER AC POWER, open;
     BATTERY CHARGER, BAT A CHARGE, open; INVERTER
     CONTROL 2, open; INVERTER CONTROL 3, open;
     you've already done the MAIN BUS TIE; and then
     BAT CHARGE switch to AC 1. Over on panel 3,
     you have already set the AC INVERTER 2 to OFF
     and then INVERTER 2 AC BUS 2, OFF; AC BUS 2
     RESET to OFF. You have already put the BATTERY
     CHARGER switch to OFF; and your DC Indicator
     select to MAIN B. Over.

[04:15:26:46]
_page : 567
_tape : Tape 75/7
CMP: Okay, Jack. Do you want me to read it back to
     you?

[04:15:26:51]
CC:  No, if you've got something in the right-hand
     column for all of those, we don't want to have
     to do it. And now one more thing I owe you is
     how to untransfer [glossary:LM] power to the [glossary:CSM], and I'll
     get that for you in a jiffy.

[04:15:27:22]
CMP: Okay. I'll be standing by to copy it.

[04:15:27:25]
CC:  Okay. We have a last minute change to that.

[04:15:33:12]
CMP: Houston, 13.

[04:15:33:23]
CC: Go ahead.

[04:15:33:27]
CMP: One thing I guess you probably
     all have considered it, but what heavy things
     can we store down there where the [glossary:SRC]s normally
     go to help increase our L over D?

[04:15:33:43]
CC:  I understand the question is what kind of heavy
     things can you store where the [glossary:SRC]s go.

[04:15:33:50]
CMP: Yes. They go down in the [glossary:LEB] underneath the
     computer, and the heavier things you have down
     there increases the L over D. We don't have
     any [glossary:SRC]s, so I was just wondering what heavy
     things - We could probably put some cameras,
     television cameras, things like that that normally 
     pretty heavy down there in - that, in our
     [glossary:SRC]. No, we can't put the in our [glossary:SRC], but we
     could put them in that container down there
     which would help decrease our L over D. 
     Anything else you can think of would be greatly
     appreciated because we don't even have a
     throwaway station, so we're down a little bit
     in L over D.

[04:15:34:33]
CC: Okay. Let me pass that question along, and get
     somebody working on it.

[04:15:35:03]
CC:  Souvenirs, I guess.

[04:15:35:09]
_page : 568
_tape : Tape 75/8
CMP: What souvenirs? (Laughter) All I've got is
     a Marine Corps foxhole-digging shovel.

[04:15:35:19]
CC:  You've got all you need then, buddy.

[04:15:35:27]
CC:  Okay. Ready to copy the power removal from
     the command module/[glossary:LM] umbilical.

[04:15:35:35]
CMP: I'm ready to copy. Go ahead.

[04:15:35:40]
CC:  Okay. This assumes that all the descent batteries
     are on line and ASCENT BATTERY 6 is on NORMAL
     FEED, as we said earlier. First thing you do is
     go in the [glossary:CSM] and look on panel 5 circuit breaker.
     [glossary:LM] POWER-2 MAIN B, open; [glossary:LM] POWER-1 MAIN A, open;
     circuit breaker [glossary:EPS] SENSOR SIGNAL MAIN B, open.

[04:15:36:18]
CMP: Hey, Jack.

[04:15:36:20]
CC:  Go ahead.

[04:15:36:31]
CMP: ... You got just a little bit scratchy there 
     because of the antenna problem. Let me read this back to you.

[04:15:36:53]
CMP: Okay. What I got, Jack, was the procedure assumes
     that all DESCENT BATTERIES are ON, and BAT 6 is
     on NORMAL FEED. Now we're going into the [glossary:LM] and
     on panel 5, we take [glossary:LM], or [glossary:CM] [glossary:LM] POWER-2, MAIN B,
     open. And that's as far as I got.

[04:15:37:18]
CC: Okay, the second one is on panel 5 also. Circuit
     breaker, [glossary:LM] POWER-1, MAIN A, open; circuit breaker
     [glossary:EPS] SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN B, open. Okay, read those
     back for the [glossary:CSM], and I'll give you some steps in the [glossary:LM].

[04:15:37:40]
CMP: Okay.

[04:15:37:58]
CMP: Okay. CB [glossary:LM] POWER-2, MAIN B, open; CB [glossary:LM] POWER-1,
     MAIN A, open; CB [glossary:EPS] SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN B, open.
     Stand by 1, Jack.

[04:15:38:15]
CMP: Jack, I don't think we ever closed CB [glossary:LM] POWER-1,
     MAIN A. We closed [glossary:LM] POWER-2, MAIN B, and [glossary:LM] POWER-1, MAIN B. Both of them on MAIN B.

[04:15:38:36]
CC:  Yes, you're right. Both of them should be MAIN B.

[04:15:38:42]
_extra : Pagr 562
CMP: Okay. Copy that.

[04:15:38:47]
_page : 569
_tape : Tape 75/9
CC: Okay. Ready to copy the [glossary:LM]?

[04:15:38:52]
CMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[04:15:38:55]
CC:  Okay. On panel 16 circuit breaker, [glossary:EPS], BAT FEED
     TIES, two, open; and now you've got to listen real
     carefully for high volts and low volts, BATTERY 1,
     HIGH VOLTS, to OFF/RESET; BATTERY 2, LOW VOLTS, to
     OFF/RESET and then ON: BATTERY 2, HIGH VOLTS, to
     OFF/RESET and then ON; BATTERY 1, HIGH VOLTS, ON;
     and then the circuit breaker on panel 16, [glossary:EPS]:
     BAT FEED TIES, both of them, closed. Read back.

[04:15:40:20]
CMP: Okay. On the [glossary:LM] side of the house is on panel 16.
     CB [glossary:EPS] BAT FEED TIES, two, open; BATTERY 1, HIGH
     VOLTAGE, OFF/RESET; BATTERY 2, LOW VOLTAGE, OFF/RESET
     then ON; BATTERY 2, HIGH VOLTAGE, OFF/RESET
     then ON; BATTERY 1, HIGH VOLTAGE, ON. Panel 16,
     CB BAT FEED TIES, two closed.

[04:15:40:56]
CC: Okay. That's a good readback. It concludes the
     procedure going both ways and now we just have to stand by.

[04:15:41:06]
CMP: Okay, when do you plan to start this?

[04:15:41:10]
CC:  Darn soon.

[04:15:41:15]
CMP: Did you say not soon?

[04:15:41:17]
CC:  No, we're going to do it pretty soon, but we want
     to have high bit rate, and we don't want you to
     give that to us until we tell you.

[04:15:41:29]
CMP: Okay. I think I'll go back and try to undamp up
     there. Do you have anything more for the command
     module?

[04:15:41:43]
CC:  We're discussing two items, but we don't have them
     ready right now.

[04:15:41:56]
CMP: One of them, I hope, is a foolproof alinement
     procedure.

[04:15:42:37]
CMP: Okay, Jack. Just for curiosity's sake, does [glossary:FIDO]
     have any information as to whether that helium -
     that helium tank dump affected our trajectory at all?

[04:15:43:21]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. Our tracking data shows that since
     the helium dump, our entry angle has not changed
     from its value of 6.24 and somebody calculated
     that if we had a propulsive vent, that helium could
     roughly, at the maximum, only impart a DELTA-V of
     a half a foot per second or less, anyway. But
     we're continuing to track and as soon as we get
     some more info, we'll pass it along.

[04:15:43:57]
_page : 570
_tape : Tape 75/10
CMP: Okay. That's swell, Jack. Thank you.

[04:15:44:00]
CC:  Sure.

[04:15:44:01]
CMP: Your 6.24 sounds good.

[04:15:44:14]
CDR: I'm still awake, I guess.

[04:15:44:22]
CMP: They said that it would be a while because they want
     to get high bit rate. They don't want to put high bit rate. ...

[04:15:46:40]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. We're ready. So we want some
     high bit rate. To do that, go over to panel 16
     under COMM and close the PRIMARY S-BAND POWER
     AMPLIFIER. On your COMM panel -

[04:15:46:56]
CMP: Okay. Okay, Jack. Wait 1. While - I'd like to
     get the whole crew up for this if you don't mind.

[04:15:47:04]
CC:  Okay.

[04:15:47:09]
CMP: ... they're ready to start. Yes, you want to get
     Fred-o up.

[04:15:47:20]
CMP: We want to transfer some power - I want to go to
     high bit rate here first, then want to transfer [glossary:LM] power to [glossary:CSM], Fred.

[04:15:47:39]
CMP: Okay, Jim, I'll give you the COMM.

[04:15:47:40]
CC:  Aquarius, there's no great big rush. If you want
     to let Fred come up to speed slowly, why maybe that'll help out

[04:15:47:55]
CMP: Okay. ...

[04:15:48:47]
CDR: And Houston, Jack is showing Fred the procedures
     before we start up.

[04:15:48:57]
CC:  Say again, Jim.

[04:15:49:02]
CDR: ...

[04:15:50:27]
_page : 571
_tape : Tape 75 /11
CC: Aquarius, how do you read?

[04:15:50:32]
CDR: Loud and clear.

[04:15:50:33]
CC:  Okay. I'm hearing you now. I think I missed your
     last transmission, Jim.

[04:15:50:41]
CDR: Okay. Jack is showing Fred the procedures. Want
     to get him familiarized with them, and how to get
     out of any problems before we proceed.

[04:15:50:54]
CC:  Roger. No rush. Just let us know when you're
     ready. We don't want old Fred-o to slip a gimbal
     there.

[04:15:51:05]
CDR: Yes. We're watching him.

[04:15:53:24]
CDR: Boy, if you took 120 hours out. Oh. ... Okay. ...

[04:15:54:15]
LMP: Houston, Aquarius.

[04:15:54:18]
CC:  Hello, Fred. Go ahead.

[04:15:54:23]
LMP: Okay, I guess the only question I have is in the
     first - the very first portion involving the [glossary:LM]
     here where it has me turn on the only BAT 6, and
     then turn off all the DESCENT BATTERIES. Are
     you still reading me?

[04:15:54:53]
CC:  Okay. I read you until after turn off BAT 6 -
     Correction, turn on only BAT 6.

[04:15:55:03]
LMP: Okay, the question is "Only one ASCENT BATTERY BAT 6
     on the line," immediately followed by turning off
     four DESCENT BATs. Is that correct?

[04:15:55:18]
CC:  That's affirmative, Fred. That question has been
     banged around and we decided to go that way.

[04:15:55:38]
LMP: Let's see, we will be powering other BUS via the
     CROSS TIE BALANCE LOADS breaker. Is that correct?

[04:15:55:47]
CC:  That's affirmative, and we're reading a current
     of 11 amps right now.

[04:15:55:55]
LMP: Okay. Okay. I guess I'm ready, then. That's
     11 amps?

[04:15:56:00]
CC:  And after you turn BAT 6 on the line, you might as
     well take a look at the BATs 1 through 4 and so
     forth, and make sure that it's okay to turn them
     off.

[04:15:56:16]
_page : 572
_tape : Tape 75/12
LMP: Roger. Are you ready, gang?

[04:15:56:21]
CC:  Yes, we're ready for the POWER AMPLIFIER and the
     HIGH BIT RATE, and NORMAL VOICE, on the FUNCTION switch, please.

[04:15:56:32]
LMP: Okay.

[04:15:56:58]
CC: Okay, gang; we've got the HIGH BIT RATE, now.

[04:15:57:04]
LMP: Roger.

[04:15:57:29]
CC:  Okay, we see BAT 6, ON, and it looks good, Fred-o.

[04:15:57:38]
LMP: Okay. Am I cleared to proceed with the next
     step, getting 1, 2, 3, and 4, OFF/RESET?

[04:15:57:46]
CC:  Affirmative. You're cleared for BATs 1 through 4,
     OFF/RESET.

[04:15:57:54]
LMP: Okay.

[04:15:58:13]
CC: Okay. Still looks good.

[04:15:59:13]
LMP: Okay, Houston. We need a call from you when to
     have Jack to proceed up into the Odyssey and start up there.

[04:15:59:31]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius; and Jack can get with it right now.

[04:15:59:38]
LMP: Okay.

[04:16:06:11]
LMP: Okay, Houston; Aquarius. We've completed the
     powerup and things look good upstairs. Are we
     GO for proceeding with battery charge?

[04:16:06:28]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius; you're GO on the battery charge.

[04:16:06:34]
LMP: Roger.

[04:16:07:36]
LMP: Boy, this is really a switch, isn't it, Jack?

[04:16:07:48]
CC:  That's an understatement. You're not known for that.

[04:16:07:54]
LMP: Yes. I think if you add up the - Yes - if you add
     up the operating time, I think the [glossary:LM] beats the
     [glossary:CSM] by a considerable margin on this flight.

[04:16:08:34]
CC:  Grumman just hired you.

[04:16:08:38]
_page : 573
_tape : Tape 75/13
LMP: Yes.

[04:16:08:51]
CC:  You're out there at 134000, coming in at about
     4900 feet a second.

[04:16:08:58]
LMP: Very good.

[04:16:10:04]
CC:  The SUPERCRIT tank went off at about 1937, just
     about like expected.

[04:16:10:11]
LMP: Yes. It - it also must of not did very much, 
     except the rates. I was asleep then and I didn't hear a thing.

[04:16:10:25]
CC:  Is the command - service module still venting?

[04:16:10:36]
LMP: Jack said it was just before he went up. Right
     now, the Sun's over there, and I can't really tell - -

[04:16:10:42]
CC:  And - -

[04:16:10:44]
CC:  We asked him a long time ago if he was able to see
     any stars out the optics. I don't think we ever
     got an answer.

[04:16:10:52]
LMP: Okay.

[04:16:11:04]
LMP: That's a pretty good sleep station I had rigged
     up, Jack. I took one of the sleep restraints out
     of the command module, zipped up in it, and then
     hooked the tie, right at the top of the zipper,
     onto the [glossary:LM] upper hatch handle. So it kind of
     held me there, and then just drifted up in the
     tunnel upside down with my face toward the hatch,
     so the sunlight didn't get in my eyes and that
     worked pretty good.

[04:16:11:35]
CC:  Did you sleep pretty well that way?

[04:16:11:39]
LMP: Yes, no problem at all.

[04:16:11:44]
CC:  Is Jim sleeping that way now, or is he standing
     next to you?

[04:16:11:49]
LMP: He's standing next to me.

[04:16:11:51]
CC:  About time for him to go to bed.

[04:16:11:57]
_page : 574
_tape : Tape 75/14
LMP: Okay. The voltage upstairs is 34.3 and the charger
     is reading 2.5 amps.

[04:16:12:06]
CC:  Okay 34.3 and 2.5. And ... says ... - -

[04:16:12:11]
LMP: - - pretty cold. Good.

[04:16:12:12]
CC:  Say again your last.

[04:16:12:16]
LMP: They came - both came down here rubbing their
     hands, shivering. It's pretty cool upstairs.

[04:16:12:26]
CC:  Are you keeping warm in the [glossary:LM]?

[04:16:12:41]
LMP: Yes. It's pretty reasonable down here.

[04:16:13:25]
LMP: Okay. And right now, it looks like ... right now,
     it looks like the command module isn't venting,
     Jack, so I'm going to try to take a look at the
     optics.

[04:16:13:48]
CC:  Okay. You say it is not venting?

[04:16:13:52]
LMP: Yes. That's the word. We've just looked through
     the [glossary:AOT] and you can't see anything back there.

[04:16:14:00]
CC:  Okay. And everything's fine in El Lago.

[04:16:14:06]
LMP: Very good.

[04:16:15:42]
CC:  Aquarius, we're ready to secure the high bit rate.

[04:16:15:48]
LMP: Okay.

[04:16:16:32]
LMP: Houston, Aquarius; how do you read?

[04:16:16:38]
CC:  I'm hearing you with a lot of background noise,
     Fred-o.

[04:16:16:42]
LMP: Okay. How now? I just switched OMNIs again.

[04:16:23:32]
CC:  Aquarius, could you get a - amps and volts readout
     from Odyssey, please?

[04:16:23:45]
LMP: Okay. Stand by.

[04:16:24:08]
LMP: The CMP is dotting across there. You'd be amazed
     at how proficient you get at transfering to the
     tunnel after the first 1000 times.

[04:16:24:31]
_page : 575
_tape : Tape 75/15
CC:  I didn't get your last there, Fred-o. We'd like
     you to verify that your POWER AMPLIFIER circuit breaker is open.

[04:16:24:44]
LMP: Okay. That's verified. POWER AMPL breaker is
     open.

[04:16:24:48]
CC:  Roger.

[04:16:25:00]
LMP: Okay, Jack; that's 34.6 volts and just a little
     bit under 2.5 amps.

[04:16:25:08]
CC:  Okay, Fred. I copied 2.5 amps. Say again the volts, please.

[04:16:25:15]
LMP: 34.3 and that was just a little bit below 2.5.

[04:16:25:21]
CC:  34.3; thank you.

[04:16:25:33]
LMP: Okay. ... point ...

[04:16:26:06]
CC:  Fred-o, I didn't copy the last. Say again the voltage, please.

[04:16:26:17]
LMP: Okay, and the voltage is 34.6 - 34.6, amps, slightly
     less than 2.5.

[04:16:26:26]
CC:  34.6 and a little below 2.5. Thank you.

LMP: Houston, Aquarius.

[04:16:32:54]
CC:  Go ahead, Hous- Aquarius.

[04:16:32:59]
LMP: Okay. Jack reports from upstairs that he can
     see stars and constellations out of the optics
     but the Sun angle is such that it is reflecting
     off the [glossary:LM] - portion of the [glossary:LM] quad and
     other thruster ... right now. ... really
     moving around ...

[04:16:33:29]
CC:  Okay. The part I got was that he can see stars
     and constellations and there is some sunlight
     reflected off the quads. That's all I got.

[04:16:33:41]
LMP: Yes. The point being that, at least in the
     present orientation, you have to kind of wait
     until Sun isn't reflected off the [glossary:LM] to see them.

[04:16:33:59]
CC:  Okay. What you're saying is you kind of have to
     wait until the - there is no Sun reflection on
     the [glossary:LM] to see the stars. Is that right?

[04:16:34:08]
LMP: Yes. That's for the present orientation, of
     course.

[04:16:34:25]
LMP: But later on, if you can stop it moving around
     and ... ...

[04:16:34:35]
CC: Okay - -

[04:16:34:36]
LMP: ...

[04:16:34:47]
CC:  Okay, Fred-o. And we need a volts and amps
     reading.

[04:16:34:56]
LMP: Okay. And bring it back upstairs.

[04:16:35:36]
LMP: Okay. The volts, 35.0; amps, 2.4.

[04:16:35:39]
CC:  Okay. 35.0 and 2.4. Thanks, Fred.

[04:16:38:39]
CC:  The weather prediction for your landing area is
     still good; 2000 scattered, high scattered;
     4-foot seas, 15-knots wind. There's a hurricane
     500 miles to the west, which doesn't pose a
     problem.

[04:16:39:02]
LMP: A hurricane or a typhoon?

[04:16:41:24]
_page : 577
_tape : Tape 76/2
CC:  Delay my last. It's degraded to a tropical storm.

[04:16:47:17]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We need another readout
     amps and volts, and that will be our last one
     for a half hour. Over.

[04:16:48:33]
LMP: Okay. The reading is 37.8 volts, 2.3 amps.

[04:16:48:40]
CC:  Say again, Fred.

[04:16:48:43]
LMP: 37.8 volts, 2.3 amps.

[04:16:48:49]
CC:  37.8 and 2.3. And that will be our last one
     for a half hour. Thank you. And I'm about to
     exercise my fifth general order here, and pass
     it along to Joe.

[04:16:49:07]
LMP: Yes. It must be getting around a mealtime.

[04:17:13:46]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[04:17:13:53]
SC:  ...

[04:17:13:55]
CC:  Okay. This is your friendly 
     do-it-yourself-kit COMM with a suggested procedure in the
     lithium hydroxide situation. You're looking
     good. We read 1.8 millimeters, and you do have
     sufficient [glossary:LM] ... to last you the rest of the
     flight. However, being on the conservative
     side, we would like to use one more set of
     command module canisters to guard against some
     possible problems with the [glossary:LM], primary canister.
     And I have a simplified procedure for doing
     that, if you want to listen to it now. Over.

[04:17:15:15]
CC:  Okay. I think I read that you were ready. I
     forgot ... earphones. This simply consists
     of getting a second pair of cartridges out of
     the command module, putting one band of sticky
     tape, that is the gray tape, with the sticky
     side out, around the sides of each new canister
     near the top, taking a piece of [glossary:EVA] cue card and
     cutting it into four squares about 2 or 3 inches
     on a side, bending those at a right angle to
     form corner support, attaching them to the sticky
     tape, so that they'll stick up and overlap the
     old canister, and then simply putting the old
     canister next to the new canister and taping it
     up real good so it sticks together. The only
     other procedure is to remove the towel plug from
     the old cartridges and put it in the bottom of
     the new cartridge. And that's it. Over.

[04:17:16:29]
_page : 578
_tape : Tape 76/3
LMP: Okay. As I read you we get the gray tape
     and fold it so that we get - the back sticks
     around the outside of the canisters, then we
     mount to that four sides of our ... cards like
     our [glossary:EVA] ... cards; then we overlap those cards
     down around the base of the canister. Then we -
     then we ... over the ... at the top. ... Then
     we take the towel from the old ones and put them
     in the bottom of the new ones. ... ...

[04:17:17:35]
CC:  Okay, Fred. I think you got it. I didn't 
     completely copy your readback, but it's just that
     simple. We're just putting the new cartridge -
     the top of the new cartridge against the bottom
     of the old one, moving that towel plug, using
     the cue cards as little corner stiffeners, and
     taping her up.

[04:17:17:59]
LMP: Okay. The top of the new against the bottom of
     the old.

[04:17:18:03]
CC:  Roger that. That way you don't have to touch the
     hose.

[04:17:20:08]
LMP: Hey, for a change, I took the ... [glossary:LM] ... this
     morning, Joe.

[04:17:20:16]
CC:  Okay. Go ahead.

[04:17:20:20]
LMP: I got ...

[04:17:20:46]
CC:  I'm afraid I didn't copy that, Fred, and while
     I was listening, [glossary:EECOM] told me that he'd like
     another battery charge ... readout.

[04:17:22:31]
LMP: Houston, Aquarius.

[04:17:22:34]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Go.

[04:17:22:38]
LMP: You want us to start on this lithium right
     now, Joe, or is it necessary?

[04:17:22:45]
CC:  It's not time-critical, Fred, but if you have
     the people awake now, you might go ahead and
     do it. Incidentally, you probably know this,
     but the next several hours are going to be
     pretty quiet from our point of view. We're
     working on the entry procedures and should be
     ready to read them up to you in about 8 hours;
     and between now and then there's not an awful
     lot going to be going on, so you guys could be
     catching up on your sleep schedule. Over.

[04:17:23:22]
_page : 579
_tape : Tape 76/4
LMP: Okay, Joe.

[04:17:23:24]
CC:  And we would like another readout on the amps
     and volts.

[04:17:23:31]
LMP: Roger.

[04:17:24:53]
LMP: Okay. The volts, Joe, are 38.9 and the amps are 1.9.

[04:17:25:01]
CC:  Okay. Copy that, Fred. Thank you very much;
     38.9 and 1.9. And [glossary:EECOM] is simply making as
     smooth a plot as he can to verify the amount of
     amps we're putting back into the battery. That's
     why he wants it at half-hour intervals. If
     that schedule begins to interfere seriously with
     your rest cycle or so, give us a call. Over.

[04:17:25:34]
LMP: Okay.

[04:17:25:55]
LMP: Yes. Jim's sleeping now, and Jack and I are
     awake and I just finished sleeping around, I
     guess, about another 5 or 6 hours, so I'm not
     particularly inclined to go back to sleep right
     now.

[04:17:26:09]
CC:  Okay.

[04:17:38:29]
LMP: Houston, Aquarius.

[04:17:38:32]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.

[04:17:38:37]
LMP: Okay. We've got one of them ready to go, and
     it looks like we could do a pretty good job
     just using the tape strips. First combining
     them together and then just using a piece of
     paper and the bag ... get a pretty good seal ...

[04:17:38:54]
CC:  Hey; okay, Fred. We suspected that you'd
     gotten at least one on. We've noticed a
     partial pressure drop from the 1.8 to 0.8,
     which is real good.

[04:17:39:10]
LMP: Okay. You might run that by the [glossary:CPCB] and see
     if they approve our in-house ...

[04:17:39:17]
CC:  Roger that.

[04:17:39:35]

LMP: Go ahead, Joe.

[04:17:40:28]
CC:  Roger. We're convening the [glossary:CPCB] on that change,
     Fred, but FLIGHT has given you an interim go-ahead. Over.

[04:17:40:38]
LMP: Okay.

[04:17:55:51]
LMP: And, how do you read now?

[04:17:55:55]
CC:  Not too bad, Fred.

[04:17:55:59]
LMP: Okay. We've got both canisters completed now.

[04:17:56:03]
CC:  Okay. Roger that, Fred. And you're reading
     0.1 again on the CO<sub>2</sub>. Incidentally, are you guys
     having good luck getting water out of the command
     module?

[04:17:56:17]
LMP: We - We haven't tried that yet today.

[04:17:56:20]
CC:  Okay.

[04:17:56:27]
LMP: Yes. This is quite an apparatus hanging on to
     these hoses now. And that [glossary:ECS] design engineer
     ... because it sure seems to work.

[04:17:56:42]
CC:  Roger that.

[04:17:57:27]
CC:  And, Aquarius, Houston. At your convenience,
     we'd like another volts and amps readout.

[04:17:57:36]
LMP: Okay.

[04:17:59:08]
LMP: How do you read, Joe?

[04:17:59:11]

CMP: Joe, did our sticky MOD on that - those CO<sub>2</sub>
     canisters work? I'm sorry - ...

[04:18:31:07]

[04:18:56:16]

     half an hour ago, and I didn't call you on it.
     Let me check with [glossary:INCO] and see if he thinks
     everything's okay. Your COMM sounds just as
     good as it's ever been.

CC:  Jack, Houston. Over.

[04:18:58:39]
CMP: Go ahead.

[04:18:58:41]
CC:  Okay. The good [glossary:FIDO] gives us a vacuum perigee
     at the present time of 23.6 with a flight path
     angle of minus 6.25 degrees. That's without
     a midcourse. He's kind of tossing around the
     idea of doing a midcourse-7 maneuver at 5 hours
     before entry. If we do it, it looks like it
     won't be more than 2 feet per second. Over.

[04:18:59:15]
CMP: Okay.

[04:18:59:50]
CC:  And, Jack, Houston. We verified that that COMM
     problem was a ground problem.

[04:18:59:59]

     going on as you know we're working on the entry
     procedures. I've got preliminary copies, but
     we're not ready to pass - to pass it up to you.
     Looks like you're about 125 000 miles out,

     module. For your information, we put 6 amp-hours
     back in the battery already and we've got about
     14 to go. It's looking real good, and I also
     just got the word that the entry weather tomorrow
     is looking better all the time. Really looks
     great.

[04:20:30:18]
CDR: Haven't got up to ... on it. How about giving
     me a rundown?

[04:20:30:21]
CC:  Okay. We are looking at a vacuum perigee right
     now of 23.6; flight path angle of minus 6.25;
     and if we decide we want to trim that up, we're
     looking at a midcourse of about 2 feet per second. 
     Your consumables, of course, are getting
     better all the time; we've got 163 hours of
     water, 230 hours of oxygen, and 172 hours worth

     from you on the propellant tank temperatures,
     as we did yesterday. And the procedure is to,
     on panel 16, circuit breaker PROPELLANT, DISPLAY/ENGINE, 
     OVERRIDE/LOGIC to close. Then go to your

     got one more item for information for you. At 
     - In about 45 minutes or so, you will get an H<sub>2</sub>O
     quantity caution light on the descent tank. We
     expect this. It occurs at 16 percent. And it's
     no problem, because we intend to run the tank
     dry just for drill. To reset the - the light,
     on panel 2, just set the O<sub>2</sub> H<sub>2</sub>O QUANTITY MONITOR
     to the CAUTION/WARNING RESET position and the
     light will go away. Over.

[04:22:27:56]
CC:  Jim, Houston. Have you guys put on any extra
     clothes to try and ward off the nip of Jack Frost? Over.

[04:22:28:06]
CDR: Well, the lunar boots and two pair of underwear,
     and everyone is ... crawl into their sleep restraints.

[04:22:28:14]
CC:  Yes.

[04:22:28:15]
CDR: We're a little reluctant to break out the suits.

[04:22:28:18]
CC:  Yes, that's understandable. You can always use
     them if you have to. I guess it's pretty hard
     to get extra coveralls on, huh?

[04:22:43:38]
CC:  Roger. Jim, we noticed you just went to AUTO
     and back to CLOSE on the SUIT RELIEF valve.
     Is everything okay?

[04:22:43:48]
CDR: We didn't do that intentionally. Stand by.

[04:22:43:54]
CC:  Okay, maybe you didn't. Incidentally, you're
     less than 24 hours to go.

[04:22:44:00]
CDR: Roger. What happened was, our lithium hydroxide
     device here got caught in the suit relief valve.
     It is closed now. That's where you want it, right?

[04:22:44:12]
_extra : END OF TAPE

_tape : Tape 80/1
CC:  Okay.

[04:22:44:45]
CDR: And, Joe, just a reminder; now that you mention
     it - that it's less than 24 hours to go, what
     I'd like to do, and I have aboard all the 
     procedures that you are working up; so I can run
     through them with the crew, and make sure that
     we get all our signals straight.

[04:22:45:05]
CC:  Roger that, Jim. We are trying to get the
     procedures finished and up to you as quickly
     as we can. They exist. What's going on now
     is the guys are running them in the CMS/LMS,
     integrate, to make darn sure that the attitudes
     are correct and the time line is nice and relaxed 
     and all that good stuff. And they won't
     be finished that run for another few hours.
     However, we expect to have an overall time line
     and a sequence of events for you before that
     time, and we'll start with the procedures as
     soon as they get ready. Over.

[04:22:45:50]
CDR: Okay. That's good. I think ... ought to go
     back to the original procedures we have on board
     and modify them as we have the time to.

[04:22:46:18]
CC:  Okay, Jim. Roger. We're going to do that to
     the maximum extent possible. And it looks
     reasonably feasible. To begin with in the command 
     module we're going to have to send you
     some separate sequences for powering it up a
     little bit at a time. The closer we get to
     entry the more we get on the checklist. By the
     time we're about at [glossary:EI] minus 45 we're on the
     checklist all the way.

[04:22:46:39]
CDR: Okay.

[04:22:46:49]
CDR: And just as a reminder, don't forget our stowage
     problem. We - We still have to do quite a bit of stowage of the 
     drogue and probe in the [glossary:LM], and, et cetera.

[04:22:46:59]
CC:  Roger that. We've got a team working on that,
     and incidentally, one of the information items
     that they want to know is which lithium hydroxide
     containers in the command module are empty. They
     just want to know that for weight and balance -
     and there's no rush about it - -

     people - Tell them that they don't have to

     going to be coming at you with the - with the
     overall time line for tomorrow morning. You
     might want to think about taking a few notes,
     although we don't have detailed procedures for
     you at this time. Maybe you want to have Fred or

[05:00:21:05]
CC:  For our benefit while we do this briefing, Jim,
     we'd like to have the, the COMM better, and we
     can sure spare the power; so we'd like you on
     panel 16 to close the POWER AMPLIFIER circuit
     breaker, and on panel 12 we'd like you to move
     the VOICE FUNCTION switch to VOICE. Over.

[05:00:22:22]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius; Houston. How do you read?

[05:00:22:26]
CDR: Read you loud and clear.

[05:00:22:27]
CC:  Okay, and you're real good. It's a - It's a
     pleasure not to have all that noise. Let me tell
     you what I want to do, Jim. As I said, we're
     not going to give you detailed procedures, now.
     What we expect to have for you shortly are procedures 
     which we'll try and get up to you in the
     following form. First, we'll have a time line,
     sort of a flight plan thing, which will have the
     times of all the major events and any configurations, 
     switch settings, and so forth which are
     peculiar to our configuration and which, 
     therefore, you won't find in the checklist. This, for
     instance, will be true of the way we power up
     the command module; and second, of course, we'll
     have any redlines to the checklist so that you
     can enter the checklist where possible to - to
     perform functions, and the time line will simply
     refer you to the checklist when that's appropriate.
     Okay?

[05:00:23:32]
_page : 596
_tape : Tape 81/2
CDR: Okay. Sounds good. You're going to give me an
     overall time line now, I take it; is that right?

[05:00:23:36]
CC:  That's affirm. I'm going to first of all just
     quickly run through the times of the major
     events, and then we'll go back and fill in some
     of the details. Okay. Entry interface is at
     142 hours 40 minutes; 6-1/2 hours, roughly prior
     to that or at about [time:05:16:10:00|136:10], we'll start this
     whole thing going by applying [glossary:IMU] HEATER POWER,
     by checking the CM/[glossary:RCS] temperatures and preheating
     the CM/[glossary:RCS] if required, and we suspect we'll
     probably want to do that. We'll have detailed
     procedures up for it later. At about 6 hours
     prior to [glossary:EI] or about [time:05:16:40:00|136:40], we will commence
     powering up the [glossary:LM], powering up the [glossary:AGS], using
     the modified [glossary:LM]/[glossary:DPS] [glossary:RCS] 30-minute checklist, which
     you have used for the previous midcourse. Then
     shortly, just before 5 hours, prior to [glossary:EI] or at
     about [time:05:17:49:00|137:49], we'll want you in the attitude for a
     [glossary:LM] [glossary:AGS] body axis alinement, using the Earth
     terminator like we did before; and as soon as
     we have that, we'll perform [glossary:MCC]-7, which looks
     like, now, about a 2-foot-per-second burn or
     about 15 seconds of [glossary:RCS]. And I'm told that it's
     down to 1-1/2 now, so it's comfortably within
     the [glossary:RCS] margin. Okay. When we do that, we'll
     immediately start the maneuver to the service
     module jettison attitude, which will be in plane
     since we're jettisoning it earlier than we usually
     do. We don't need, and don't want, the 
     out-of-plane component. So it'll be in plane with the
     service module pointed back out along the radius
     vector. We will then commence to get the command
     module ready for service module SEP, including
     command module [glossary:RCS] checkout and hot fire, and at
     approximately 4 hours and 30 minutes prior to [glossary:EI]
     or [time:05:18:10:00|138:10], we'll jettison the service module.
     We'll pitch the [glossary:LM] up until we aquire the
     service module in the ... and try and get some
     photographs, but we're not going to fool around
     with [glossary:LM] translation maneuvers for pictures
     because we don't want to screw up - foul up your
     flight path angle at that time. Okay. That
     gives us 2 hours to - of more or less open time
     here to finish up, if we're late on that, to go
     on over to checklist and prepare for powering
     up the command module. We're going to start the
     command module full powerup at [glossary:EI] minus 2 hours
     and 30 minutes or [time:05:20:10:00|140:10] [glossary:GET]. We'll get the
     computer on the line, we'll get the [glossary:IMU] up, we'll
     start uplinking your state vectors, and so forth,
     and alining the command module platform. At
     about 1 hour and 30 minutes at the latest, giving
     us an hour to do this command module stuff, we
     will start the maneuver to the [glossary:LM] jettison
     attitude. You'll then start to close out the
     [glossary:LM]. Of course, we don't have our stowage all
     configured way before this. We'll close the
     hatch, do a pressure integrity check, and at
     [glossary:EI] minus 1 hour, or 141 hours and 40 minutes,
     we'll jettison the [glossary:LM]. As soon as we do that,
     you can start the maneuver to the entry attitude.
     When you're there, do a sextant star check, take
     down the optics, and at that point we'll be giving
     you your final entry pad. You can initialize the
     [glossary:EMS], and you'll essentially be right back on the
     checklist at that point. There's one - one
     little difference from your nominal entry. You're
     a little bit earlier in the morning, so it going -
     it's going to be nighttime when you get to [glossary:EI].
     However, we're fortunate enough to have the Moon
     in a perfect position for a horizon check. We'll
     give you a Moon check instead of a horizon check,
     and you can track it right down to moonset, which
     is going to be at [glossary:EI] roughly minus 3 minutes. And
     that's it for the quick time line. Do you have
     any questions right now?

[05:00:28:11]
_page : 597
_tape : Tape 81/3
CDR: I don't believe so, Joe, right now. We'll have
     to look at those time lines, and think about it
     for a little bit.

[05:00:28:18]
CC:  Okay. Real fine. We're ready to talk in some
     more detail about the alinement procedures, the
     [glossary:CM] powerup procedures, and so forth, but why
     don't we give you a few minutes to digest what
     you've already heard.

[05:00:29:44]
_page : 598
_tape : Tape 81/4
CDR: Houston, Aquarius

[05:00:29:47]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[05:00:29:50]
CDR: Two questions so far on heating up the CM/[glossary:RCS].
     We assume that's [glossary:LM] power, and we assume that
     we're going to have to power up both [glossary:CM] buses, right?

[05:00:30:00]
CC:  Okay, Jim. I didn't want to talk about that
     because we're not quite ready to recommend a
     procedure. We can't power up the CM/[glossary:RCS] per
     the normal checklist on the [glossary:LM] power because
     we haven't got quite enough amps. It may be
     that we'll want you to heat - to do the preheat
     one ring at a time and we're looking at that.
     Another possibility is that we may want to take
     down [glossary:LM] power at that, time, do the preheat, and
     then go back to [glossary:LM] power until we have to take
     it down finally. Over.

[05:00:30:38]
CDR: Okay. Understand. second question: when we
     finish [glossary:MCC]-7, that maneuver to [glossary:SM] JETT attitude
     will be angles given to us, by you, using the
     [glossary:AGS] aline ball, right?

[05:00:30:52]
CC:  That's affirmative. Once we get that [glossary:AGS] alined
     and get a time hack on it, the good people down
     here will be able to give us [glossary:AGS] - [glossary:AGS], 8-ball
     attitudes for the service module separation
     attitude, for the command module alinement
     attitude, which we are going to pass you up the -
     a Moon/Sun [glossary:P52]-type alinement. We'll have [glossary:AGS]
     8-ball attitudes for those, and we'll be able to
     uplink through the command module once we get
     the computer up a preferred [glossary:REFSMMAT], which will
     be identical to the [glossary:LM] attitude, at the time of
     the burn. And we'll go into the details on that
     later.

[05:00:31:43]
CDR: Okay. Just stand by 1. I'll give it to you.

[05:00:31:48]
CC:  Will do.

[05:00:32:49]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[05:00:32:51]
CC:  Go ahead, Jim.

[05:00:32:55]
CDR: We would like to have plenty of ... the control
     characteristics are of the [glossary:LM]/command module, and
     whether we can use the attitude control -
     controller only to maneuver the combination to
     photograph the service module at 4 plus 30.

[05:00:33:12]
_page : 599
_tape : Tape 81/5
CC:  Okay. Good thinking. We are - it's - There has
     been a lot of consideration of what kind of
     maneuvers to let you do to photograph the [glossary:LM], I
     mean the service module. We consider it quite
     low priority; the feeling is that it will be real
     nice to get pictures of the service module, but
     they are not required for our troubleshooting
     program. As far as the - the attitude control
     authority, and so forth, we will get you more
     detailed word on that later; we are working it.
     It appears that using the ACA instead of the
     [glossary:TTCA] after service module JETT will give you
     excellent attitude control authority, and that's
     what we recommend.

[05:00:34:03]
CDR: Okay. And I'm ... - use an [glossary:AGS] ATT HOLD configuration to keep the attitudes - turn the [glossary:LM] JETT
     attitudes.

[05:00:34:14]
CC:  That's affirm. We are - We are probably going to
     recommend a tight deadband [glossary:AGS] attitude hold for
     that.

[05:00:34:23]
CDR: Okay.

[05:00:34:45]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[05:00:34:47]
CC:  Go ahead.

[05:00:34:49]
CDR: Okay. The star check at the entry attitude, is
     it a sextant star check or a [glossary:COAS] star check?

[05:00:35:00]
CC:  It'll probably be a sextant star check, Jim. It
     really depends on how good that platform is that
     we get. And we expect it to be plenty good enough
     for a sextant star check.

[05:00:35:14]
CDR: Okay.

[05:00:35:15]
CC:  While we are on that subject, Jim, I want to
     mention one thing to Jack. As I said, this [glossary:CSM]
     alinement procedure we are going to recommend is
     a Moon/Sun, and there are Sun filters stowed;
     they are stowed in compartment R-1; however,
     they are for the telescope only, of course, not
     the sextant. One is for the long eye-relief
     piece, the other for the normal eyepiece. And
     if he has any questions about that, we'll be
     glad to talk about it.

[05:00:35:54]
_page : 600
_tape : Tape 81/6
CDR: Okay.

[05:00:36:07]
CDR: And because it will be too late to do much about
     a hatch integrity check if it fails, you want us
     to have our suits on sometime during this period?

[05:00:36:20]
CC:  Okay, Jim. We are laying for you on that one;
     it is a subject that we wanted to - to bring up
     with you. We have been considering it, and our
     feelings are - Of course, it is up to you, but
     as we see the pros and cons, you just put your
     finger on the pro. We do a hatch integrity
     check shortly before EI minus 1 hours, and if we
     bust it, you would have a hard time scrambling
     into the suits. On the other hand, the disadvantages of wearing the suits are that they might
     slow you down considerably, not even counting the
     time to don them, and someone is even very
     concerned that after such and such a period of
     time in the suits, you might get too warm, and we
     might have to power up the SUIT LOOP to ventilate
     the suits and we don't particularly want to do that
     because it cost quite a bit of power. Consequently, our recommendation was going to be that you
     not wear the suit, since we have no reason to
     believe that the integrity check will show us
     anything but a slightly increased leak rate, and
     we can certainly hack that. What do you think?
     Over.

[05:00:37:38]
CDR: Well, I have confidence in the hatch, as long
     as it goes in and locks in smoothly; I see no
     reason why we need the suits, and one thing we
     are going to do during our spare time is to
     practice putting that hatch on, make sure we
     get it on and locked.

[05:00:37:55]
CC:  Okay. Real good. And with that precaution,
     think we can concur on that decision.

[05:00:38:11]
CDR: And that's all the questions we had about
     the time line you gave us.

[05:00:38:14]
CC:  Okay. Let me take a check here and see if there
     is anything anybody else wants to input to you,
     right now.

[05:00:38:54]
_page : 601
_tape : Tape 81/7
CC: Aquarius, Houston.

[05:00:38:58]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:00:38:59]
CC:  Roger. One detail that I thought you ought to
     know about the service module JETT is that we're
     going to recommend a push-pull maneuver, that is
     in the attitude I described. We'll want you to
     go half a foot per second plus-X on the [glossary:LM], then
     jettison the service module, then go half a foot
     per second minus-X, which will be less time because you're suddenly a heck of a lot lighter.
     Over.

[05:00:39:33]
CDR: Okay. Understand. You want me to go a half a
     foot per second plus-X, JETT the service module,
     and go a half a foot per second minus-X.

[05:00:39:45]
CC:  That's affirm. We think that will give you plenty
     of separation, and also will be a slow enough rate
     so you'll have a chance to get some photos.

[05:00:41:06]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:00:41:08]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:00:41:10]
CC:  Okay. One more thing we want to update you on
     with a little detail. As we told you, the ascent
     SEP attitude was in plane and the [glossary:LM] JETT attitude will be more similar to a normal service
     module SEP attitude, that is it will be [glossary:LM] up,
     out the radius vector and 45 degrees right, out
     of plane toward the south. We are going to recommend that prior to JETT, the configuration be
     with the [glossary:LM] overhead hatch closed, with the vent
     valve open, and we'll JETT with the tunnel
     pressurized. Over.

[05:00:42:10]
CDR: Okay, Joe. Understand that the [glossary:LM] JETT
     attitude will be similar to service module
     normal jettison, which will be up and out of
     plane, and as soon as I finish maneuvering to
     left JETT attitude, I'll scramble up and close
     the [glossary:LM] hatch, making sure the vent valve is open,
     and then we'll vent it - or jettison it with
     the tunnel pressurized.

[05:00:42:36]
CC:  That's affirmative. And Deke says don't forget
     to close the command module hatch on your way
     in.

[05:00:42:45]
_page : 602
_tape : Tape 81/5
CDR: I'm already scared that Jack will have it closed
     before I get up there.

[05:00:42:49]
CC:  (Laughter)

[05:00:43:08]
CC:  Okay, Jim. I think that's about all we have
     for you right now. Whenever you feel like you
     don't have any more questions at the moment,
     we'd like you to reconfigure for down voice
     backup and we'd like you to do that to move
     the VOICE FUNCTION switch to DOWNVOICE BACKUP
     as usual, but instead of pulling the circuit
     breaker, we'd like you to throw the POWER AMP
     switch to off.

[05:00:44:00]
CDR: Okay, Joe. I have one more question, here. If
     we get a little bit ahead of time on the command
     module full powerup after we jettison the service module, I'd like to go to [glossary:LM] JETT attitude
     early, and make sure we get that part squared
     away and sit there for a while before [glossary:LM] JETT
     of 1 hour. Now, will we be using [glossary:LM] power up
     to that time? There's two cables which we'll
     probably have to disconnect on the way up
     through the tunnel if we're still going to use
     [glossary:LM] power?

[05:00:44:30]
CC:  That's affirmative. Let me get word on when we
     expect to go off [glossary:LM] power.

[05:00:44:54]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:00:44:58]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:00:44:59]
CC:  Roger. We expect to go off [glossary:LM] power at the time
     we start powering up the [glossary:CSM] or about minus 2-1/2
     hours. That is not a hard number, and we'll be
     updating you on it. As far as going to the [glossary:LM]
     JETT attitude, that's completely permissible
     as soon as you have a powered up command module
     and a satisfactory platform, you can go there
     immediately. We're giving you a maximum of
     1 hour just for grins. Over.

[05:00:45:34]
CDR: Okay. Fine. And that will be a [glossary:LM] maneuver,
     I assume, because we lost the service module,
     so no strain there.

[05:00:45:42]
CC:  Affirm.

[05:00:45:49]
_page : 603
_tape : Tape 81/9
CDR: And, Jack, would like to know what entry angle
     the midcourse-7 will give us?

[05:00:45:58]
CC:  Oh, it'll put us right in the middle of the
     corridor, Jim.

[05:00:46:04]
CDR: Okay.

[05:00:46:05]
CC:  6.50 degrees. And, Jim, Houston. I guess, as
     a last item, we expect that it will take us
     about an hour to update your checklist and
     your time lines sometime later on today, and
     we'd just like you to consider that. I expect
     it'll be 3 or 4 hours before we have all that
     stuff ready.

[05:00:46:32]
CDR: Okay. We'll be standing by for that, and now
     POWER AMPLIFIER switch is going to go off, and
     then we'll be going to DOWN VOICE BACKUP.

[05:00:46:39]
CC: Okay.

[05:00:55:13]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:00:56:58]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[05:00:57:07]
CC: Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.

[05:00:57:27]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[05:00:57:28]
CC:  Roger, Jim. We're receiving you now. Go ahead.

[05:00:58:34]
CDR: Okay. I thought you were calling, but I guess
     we had a ground switching problem down there.

[05:00:58:40]
CC: Yes. We lost the lock for a little while there,
     Jim. Well, good day. Could you give us battery A voltage ... reading, please, and battery
     charger current, as you have been doing.

[05:00:58:54]
CDR: Okay, Vance. Stand by.

[05:00:58:56]
CC:  Okay.

[05:00:59:11]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[05:00:59:13]
CC:  Go ahead, Jim.

[05:00:59:16]
CDR: Okay. Volts are 39.5; amps, 1.25.

[05:00:59:23]
_page : 604
_tape : Tape 81/10
CC: Roger. Copy 39.5 and 1.25. Thank you.

[05:01:47:31]
CC: Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[05:01:47:37]
CDR: Aquarius here. Go ahead, Houston.

[05:01:47:40]
CC: Say, Jim. Could you give us another reading on the battery A voltage and BAT charger
     current on the [glossary:CSM], please.

[05:01:47:49]
CDR: BAT amps coming up.

[05:01:47:51]
CC: Okay. And sometime when you have some time
     to copy, I have an entry stowage list to
     give you which specifies which equipment
     will be moved between vehicles before splashdown.

[05:01:48:13]
_extra : END OF TAPE/nAPOLLO 13 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION
CDR: Okay. I'm - I'll be able to copy that in a
     minute.

[05:01:49:21]
_page : 605
_tape : Tape 82/1
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[05:01:49:23]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[05:01:49:25]
CDR: Volts, 39.4; amps, 1.25.

[05:01:49:30]
CC:  39.4, and say again amps.

[05:01:49:36]
CDR: 1.25.

[05:01:49:38]
CC:  Roger. Copy. Thank you.

[05:01:50:49]
CDR: Okay, Vance. We're ready to cover - to copy the
     stowage list.

[05:01:50:55]
CC:  Okay, Jim. Now, I'll give it to you in two parts.
     The first is [glossary:LM] to command module equipment transfer. The second part will be the reverse, command
     module to [glossary:LM] equipment transfer. And both parts
     represent Deltas from the launch stowage, and here
     comes the first list, [glossary:LM] to command module equipment transfer. First, [glossary:DSEA], and I'll give you the
     stowage location, too. That goes in R-13.

[05:01:51:42]
CDR: Vance, what was that again?

[05:01:51:46]
CC:  [glossary:DSEA]; that's recorder in - will go in the command
     module; it's recommended you stow it in R-13.
     Over.

[05:01:52:02]
CDR: Okay, the [glossary:DSEA] - that's the recorder - will be
     stowed in R-13.

[05:01:52:07]
CC:  That's affirm. Next. [glossary:LM] flight data file. That
     will go in R-1, R-2, and R-3. Next. Three PPKs
     in A-8.

[05:01:52:43]
CDR: Okay.

[05:01:52:44]
CC:  Okay. 16-millimeter and 70-millimeter exposed
     film in R-13. Okay, next. O<sub>2</sub> hose screen caps
     on the O<sub>2</sub> hoses. Next: two 70-millimeter Hasselblad cameras, and stow these in B-6 in the
     empty LiOH volume.

[05:01:53:45]
CC:  Okay, next. Black-and-white TV camera, and recommend stow that on top of A-7 and A-11 in decontamination bag. Next: flag kit, stowage location
     A-8. Next: [glossary:LM] fecal bags, used, R-9, waste management system chute.

[05:01:54:51]
_page : 606
_tape : Tape 82/2
CC:  Okay, that's the first list, Jim.

[05:01:54:58]
CDR: Okay.

[05:01:55:10]
CC:  And, if you want to read that one back, why then
     I'll - I'll give you the second one.

[05:01:55:22]
CDR: This is the [glossary:LM] to command module transfer, and
     this is the Delta from the launch stowage. Number 1: [glossary:DSEA] ...; number 2: [glossary:LM] flight data file
     in R-1, R-2, R-3; three PPKs in A-8 ... -

[05:01:56:15]
CDR: ... A-8; and used [glossary:LM] fecal bags in R-9.

[05:01:56:23]
CC:  Okay, that's affirm, Jim. We had a lot of noise,
     and we didn't get the middle part, but I think
     that's fairly - should be fairly clear to you,
     and don't bother with the readback of that that
     we missed, unless you have any doubts. And then
     I'll, if you're ready to copy, I'll give you the
     second list.

[05:01:56:47]
CDR: Okay.

[05:01:56:49]
CC:  Okay. This is [glossary:CM] to [glossary:LM] equipment transfer. Cabin
     fan filter and bag, and that, in the [glossary:LM], should go
     in the [glossary:ISA]. Okay, next: decontamination bags,
     except for the ones used to wrap camera, should
     go in the [glossary:ISA].

[05:01:57:33]
CC:  Okay. Two [glossary:LCG]s, if you don't have them on already,
     to the IS - [glossary:ISA]. I realize you wouldn't have them
     on, because you're cold enough already.

[05:01:57:57]
CDR: That's right.

[05:01:57:59]
CC:  Okay, and finally, four LiOH cans, the ones used
     in the [glossary:LM], and those can go in the jettison bag
     in the [glossary:LM]. Okay, a couple of notes. After loading the [glossary:ISA], recommend secure it to the righthand restraint system.

[05:01:58:40]
CC:  And secure the jettison bag to the [glossary:PLSS] on the
     floor. And that's all.

[05:01:59:07]
CDR: Okay, Vance. This is command module to [glossary:LM]: cabin
     fan filter and bag in the [glossary:ISA]; decontamination
     bags, except for the ones we use for the TV camera,
     in the [glossary:ISA]; two [glossary:LCG]s in the [glossary:ISA]; four LOiH [sic]
     cans in the JETT bag; and we'll secure the [glossary:ISA] on
     the right-hand side - on the right-hand restraint
     system, and we'll secure the JETT bags to the [glossary:PLSS]
     on the floor.

[05:01:59:36]
_page : 607
_tape : Tape 82/3
CC:  Roger. That's it.

[05:02:13:01]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[05:02:13:39]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:02:13:47]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:02:13:49]
CC:  Jim, would you give us PCM to HI bit rate. We
     think maybe we might be able to lock up on your
     high bit rate now. Over.

[05:02:15:11]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:02:15:16]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:02:15:17]
CC:  Okay, Jim. We're getting it intermittently. We
     think we might get it steady and improve circuit
     margins if you would, in addition, on panel 16,
     open the PRIMARY POWER AMPL circuit breaker, and
     I'll give you next step in a minute.

[05:02:15:39]
CDR: Okay. PRIMARY POWER AMPL is opened.

[05:02:15:41]
CC:  Okay. And on panel 12, POWER AMPL to PRIMARY.

[05:02:15:50]
CDR: POWER AMPL to PRIMARY.

[05:02:15:52]
CC:  Roger.

[05:02:17:57]
CC:  Aquarius, 13.

[05:02:18:02]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[05:02:18:04]
CC:  Or rather, Houston. Jim, it looks like we got a
     lockon, which is going to improve our data flow
     here. Only thing is, we'll probably lose data
     and probably voice, too, during a portion of each
     roll. So you might expect that. The other thing
     is, if anyone has on any BIOMED, would you switch
     your switch to - your BIOMED switch to that
     position.

[05:02:18:37]
CDR: Understand the first, Vance, and no one has on
     any BIOMED - -

[05:02:18:44]
CC:  Okay.

[05:02:18:45]
CDR: - - Fred and Jack are maneuvering things around
     right now, and mine is long since departed the
     scene.

[05:02:18:51]
_page : 608
_tape : Tape 82/4
CC:  Okay. Copy.

[05:02:19:30]
CDR: Vance, you might be interested - the way we're -
     the way we got this thing arranged, we have one
     helmet attached to the COMM lines attached to the
     [glossary:LM] hoses, and the guy that's got the duty wears
     the helmet, so the other people are free to
     maneuver.

[05:02:19:48]
CC:  Right. That's understandable. One guy's on the
     leash, huh?

[05:02:19:58]
CDR: Yes. ...

[05:02:25:10]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:02:25:15]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:02:25:17]
CC:  Jim, when you get finished moving your stowage
     around and it's convenient, we'd like to terminate
     the battery charge for a little while to bring up
     the [glossary:CM] TM so we can take a look at the temperatures
     again, like we did yesterday. Advise that right
     now on your batteries, you have 111 amp-hours;
     and, eventually, we hope to have them up - peaked
     up to about 116. One other point, we - we can
     either read that procedure up again which involves
     cranking up the telemetry, or, if Jack still has
     it, we can use his notes and - but I have one or
     two changes to - to make on them. Over.

[05:02:26:11]
CDR: Okay, understand that you'll want us to terminate
     battery charge for a while, and crank up the CM
     TM to read out temperatures. And you have a few
     changes to Jack's checklist, and I'll turn the
     COMM over here to Jack shortly, as soon as he's
     finished, and we'll get along with it.

[05:02:26:33]
CC:  Okay, we'll be standing by for - there's no hurry
     on it.

[05:02:38:10]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[05:02:38:15]
CC:  Go ahead, Jim.

[05:02:38:18]
CDR: Just out of curiosity, Vance, what's our distance
     and velocity now?

[05:02:38:24]
CC:  Hey, stand by 1. You're speeding up, I think.

[05:02:38:47]
CC:  Jim, we have you 101 000 miles out, and your
     velocity is 5848. Starting to speed up.

[05:02:38:56]
_page : 609
_tape : Tape 82/5
CDR: Okay. Thank you.

[05:02:38:58]
CC:  Sure enough.

[05:02:41:59]
CMP: Okay, Houston; Aquarius.

[05:02:42:03]
CC:  Go ahead, Jack.

[05:02:42:06]
CMP: Okay, Vance. Jim said that you want to terminate
     battery charge on battery A.

[05:02:42:13]
CC:  That's affirm, Jack. Request to - Before you
     terminate it, get the usual readout on voltage
     and current; and we'd also like a time of termination, and understand you have the termination
     procedures. Is that affirm?

[05:02:42:35]
CMP: Okay. That's affirm. Stand by. Let me just
     make sure I've got everything here before I go
     off on a tangent.

[05:02:42:43]
CC:  Okay, Jack, and your battery-charge termination
     procedure remains unchanged, but when we go to
     power up the [glossary:CM] and look at your TM, we have a
     couple of additional steps.

[05:02:43:23]
CMP: Okay. Vance, I do have the procedure for stopping
     the battery charge. And do you want me to copy
     this procedure now, or do you want me to come back
     and give you the volt, amps, and time and - after
     I complete this termination?

[05:02:43:47]
CC:  Okay. Just - just give us the volts and amps
     just before you start the termination of the procedure, and understand you say you have the
     charge - the procedure for taking the charge off.
     Is that affirm?

[05:02:44:09]
CMP: That's affirm.

[05:02:44:11]
CC:  Okay. And just give us a hack on the time - -

[05:02:44:13]
CMP: And you want to - you want to review it at all?

[05:02:44:19]
CC:  Negative. Unless you want me to. I'll tell you
     what; I could run through it very quickly just
     to verify that we're getting started off on the
     correct path here.

[05:02:44:31]
CMP: Yes. Okay, the first four or five things that
     I have is panel BAT CHARGE to OFF on panel 3; AC
     INVERTER 2, OFF; panel 5: MAIN BUS TIE, BAT A/C
     ON; panel 250: CB BAT A POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING,
     open; panel 275: INVERTER POWER 2, MAIN B, open;
     and then, the - just to go ahead and reverse the
     position of the switches and circuit breakers
     that I started out with, and these don't have to
     be in reverse order. Is that Charlie?

[05:02:45:12]
_page : 610
_tape : Tape 82/6
CC:  Roger, that's - that's Charlie. Have at it.

[05:02:45:17]
CMP: Okay, we'll get a volts and amps right now.

[05:02:45:20]
CC:  Okay.

[05:02:46:12]
CMP: Okay, Vance. The volts and amps: 39.4; amps,
     1.25.

[05:02:46:22]
CC:  Okay, Jack. We copy that. Incidentally - -

[05:02:46:27]
CMP: Okay. We're going up to termin - Go ahead, Vance.

[05:02:46:33]
CC:  Never mind, Jack. I'll bring this up later when
     you've finished the procedure.

[05:02:46:47]
CMP: Okay. I'm going off the air; I'll put Fred-o on.
     I'm going to stop the battery charge.

[05:02:46:55]
CC:  Okay.

[05:02:47:30]
LMP: Now, how do you read, Vance?

[05:02:47:32]
CC:  Hey, loud and clear, Fred. Understand you've
     been doing some spring housecleaning, moving
     stowage around up there.

[05:02:47:40]
LMP: Boy, you wouldn't believe this [glossary:LM] right now; it's
     nothing but bags from floor to ceiling.

[05:02:47:46]
CC:  Hey, that brings up a question. We were wondering
     where you guys plan to stow the probe and drogue?
     It occurred to us that one possibility was to stow
     it in the [glossary:LM], down about where the LMP normally
     stands, underneath the IS - [glossary:ISA]er. Perhaps you
     have a better idea. Over.

[05:02:48:12]
LMP: Yes, I do, Vance. ... would go in the [glossary:LM], but I
     thought maybe we ought to stow it where the CDR
     stands. How's that?

[05:02:48:22]
CC:  Okay. I can tell that you're just getting -
     getting that one over because Jim just got off
     the loop.

[05:02:48:33]
_page : 611
_tape : Tape 82/7
LMP: Yes, he's sleeping. No, that's - that's actually
     where we normally had been stowing it for normal
     [glossary:LM] JETTs.

[05:02:48:44]
CC:  Okay, and - Hey, we just - we'll record that, and
     figure that you'll stow the probe and drogue over
     in the - where the CDR stands. We have a - a
     change to this - equipment transfer list that I
     just read up to Jim. Why don't you make a note
     of this one item? Forget about the [glossary:LM] - -

[05:02:49:07]
LMP: Stand by; stand by 1.

[05:02:49:08]
CC:  Okay.

[05:02:49:14]
LMP: I think Jack hauled off the piece of paper with
     that - all that on it. Why don't you hold it
     until Jack gets done doing the battery charge?

[05:02:49:24]
CC:  Okay.

[05:02:49:39]
CC:  And, Fred, request PCM on LO bit rate, now.

[05:02:49:44]
LMP: Okay. And there was one piece of flight data
     that we needed that we didn't bring along this
     time.

[05:02:50:00]
CC:  What was that?

[05:02:50:04]
LMP: That's a big book with a lot of just plain old
     blank pages in it.

[05:02:50:10]
CC:  Yes, when you - when you get off nominal, why
     you just need scratch paper, don't you?

[05:02:50:17]
LMP: Yes.

[05:02:51:28]
LMP: Okay, Vance. I got the stowage list now.

[05:02:51:32]
CC:  Okay, I gave you two lists - -

[05:02:51:33]
LMP: And Jack's got - and Jack said he's completed -
     the - secured the battery charge now.

[05:02:51:44]
CC:  Okay, and we're recording the time that that was
     complete. You have two lists there, one is [glossary:LM]
     to [glossary:CM] equipment transfer and the second list is
     the reverse. Request you scratch the last item
     on the first list, which is returning used bags
     to the [glossary:CM].

[05:02:52:11]
_page : 612
_tape : Tape 82/8
LMP: Okay. We didn't have any of those, so that
     didn't pose any problem anyway.

[05:02:52:20]
CC:  Okay.

[05:02:53:28]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:02:53:29]
CMP: Okay, Vance. Aquarius is back on.

[05:02:53:32]
CC:  Okay, Jack. Understand you completed securing
     the battery charge. Now if you are ready to copy,
     Jack, I would like to give you the two changes
     that we have to the powerup for the [glossary:CM] procedure.
     Over.

[05:02:53:55]
CMP: Okay. Stand by 1.

[05:02:53:56]
CC:  Okay.

[05:02:54:59]
CMP: Okay, Vance. You say you have some changes in
     the procedures that I used before to get telemetry
     and to check out the [glossary:CSM] system?

[05:02:55:07]
CC:  Yes, that's correct, Jack; they're pretty simple.
     About halfway through the procedure, we have a
     step on panel 3, which is POWER AMPL, HIGH; we'd
     like to change that to POWER AMPL, LOW.

[05:02:55:29]
CMP: Okay. Copy. POWER AMPL, LOW.

[05:02:55:33]
CC:  And the next change, Jack, is panel 275. Scratch
     the step "CB MAIN B, BAT B, close - BAT BUS B,
     close."

[05:02:55:50]
CMP: Okay. You want to delete the step "CB MAIN B,
     BAT BUS B, close."

[05:02:55:55]
CC:  Roger. As you know, we're going to do this on
     [glossary:LM] power, so this reflects that.

[05:02:56:04]
CMP: Okay. Real fine.

[05:02:56:07]
CC:  Okay, and have at it. We - we'd like to have the
     TM up for about 5 or 10 minutes to look at the
     data from the CM; look at your temperatures,
     et cetera. And after that, we'll go back to
     charging the battery again, and the charge will
     probably go until around [glossary:GET] 126.

[05:02:56:27]
CMP: Okay. Do you want the same readouts from me
     that I gave you before?

[05:02:56:34]
_page : 613
_tape : Tape 82/9
CC:  That's affirmative, Jack. And just to make sure
     that there is no mistaking the procedure, it
     starts out for the backout part: panel 3, POWER
     AMPL, OFF; TRANSPONDER, OFF; AC INVERTER 2, OFF;
     then goes to panel 250, et cetera.

[05:02:57:07]
CMP: That's - that's the way I read it.

[05:02:57:09]
CC:  Okay.

[05:02:57:13]
CMP: Okay; going back up into the refrigerator.

[05:02:57:17]
CC:  Hey, I thought it was the bedroom.

[05:02:57:22]
CMP: Well, it's got a new name now, because it is
     about 30 degrees cooler.

[05:02:57:30]
CC:  Roger. Returning to the deep freeze - -

[05:02:57:31]
CMP: - - Hey, Vance. One thing that I wanted to ask
     you - is on the stowage list where you have us
     putting the black-and-white TV camera on top of
     A-7 in an A ... decontamination bag, I was
     wondering if it would be possible or if you -
     there would be any problem in putting it into
     B-6 along with the two 70-millimeter Hasselblad
     cameras?

[05:02:58:02]
CC:  Jack, I don't think there'll be any problem,
     if you can get it in, but let us get - work
     that and get back with you. Okay?

[05:02:58:10]
CMP: All right. I was just thinking. I'm trying to
     get as much weight as possible down there in that
     [glossary:LEB]. We have no [glossary:SRC]s and then our waste tank
     is - you know - rather depleted. I think it's
     about down to 40 percent or so. So I'm trying
     to get as much L over D as I can, and any heavy
     items we can get down there, I'd be greatly
     appreciative of you bringing it to our attention.

[05:02:58:39]
CC:  Okay. We copy that, and we owe you an answer
     on your last question.

[05:02:58:46]
CMP: Okay. And I'm in work, going to give you some
     telemetry.

[05:02:58:51]
CC:  Okay.

[05:03:06:21]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We're receiving [glossary:CSM] data now.

[05:03:06:27]
LMP: Roger.

[05:03:09:08]
_page : 614
_tape : Tape 82/10
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:03:09:15]
LMP: Say again, Vance.

[05:03:09:17]
CC:  Fred, we just lost data on Aquar - on Jack.
     Would you have him select best OMNI, please?

[05:03:09:27]
LMP: Okay.

[05:03:11:34]
CC: Aquarius, Houston.

[05:03:11:39]
LMP: All right. Go ahead.

[05:03:11:41]
CC:  Fred, we have enough data; recommend that Jack
     take off the TM and power back down again, using
     his backout procedure. Just let us know when he
     does it.

[05:03:11:56]
LMP: Okay.

[05:03:11:59]
CC:  And, after that, we'll start the battery charge,
     and we'll have to know when he starts that.

[05:03:12:07]
LMP: Okay. He's starting to back out now. Just out
     of curiosity, what - did you all get a readout
     on what the cabin temp was up there?

[05:03:12:20]
CC:  Yes, we're getting 45 to 46 degrees.

[05:03:12:31]
LMP: Now you see why we call it the refrigerator.

[05:03:12:35]
CC:  Yes, it's kind of a cold winter day up there,
     isn't it? Is it snowing in the command module
     yet?

[05:03:12:50]
LMP: Is it what, Vance?

[05:03:12:52]
CC:  Is it snowing in there yet?

[05:03:12:59]
LMP: Oh, snowing. No - no, not quite. The windows
     are in pretty bad shape, and I guess the service
     module - we'll be trying to shoot out of the
     [glossary:LM] window, because every window in the command
     module is just covered with water droplets. It's
     going to take a lot of scrubbing to get those
     cleared off.

[05:03:13:21]
_page : 615
_tape : Tape 82/11
CC:  Roger. Understand. Pete says to tell you that
     you'll have some time on the beach in Samoa to
     thaw out after this cold experience.

[05:03:13:37]
LMP: Hey, that sounds great.

[05:03:14:01]
LMP: Vance, have you all thought about what cameras
     you wanted to use? Right now, we've got configured a Hasselblad with a 250, and I've got the
     lunar-surface number 1 Hasselblad, and I've got
     the lunar surface sequence camera, also, rigged
     and ready to go. Did you have any other druthers
     about the ...

[05:03:14:26]
CC:  You are referring to the photography of the service module, is that right?

[05:03:14:32]
LMP: That's right.

[05:03:14:33]
CC:  We have some procedures in work, and I've seen
     them, Fred. I think pretty soon we'll be shooting them up to you to specify which cameras and
     settings. But that - that sounds pretty close.

[05:03:14:50]
LMP: Okay, you might let them know that, if they hadn't
     thought of it, that we got this lunar-surface
     sequence camera on board which has its own battery pack setup, and to shoot quite a few pictures
     with, and that could also be used for this.

[05:03:15:04]
CC:  Roger. I know we are planning to use that camera, among others.

[05:03:15:11]
LMP: Okay.

[05:03:18:11]
LMP: Okay, Houston; Aquarius. Jack has backed out of
     powering up the [glossary:CM], and now he's proceeding to
     restart battery charge on BAT A.

[05:03:18:25]
CC:  Okay. Real good, Fred. We copy.

[05:03:21:32]
_extra : END OF TAPE/nAPOLLO 13 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPTION
LMP: Okay. And we are charging battery A now.

[05:03:21:37]
_page : 616
_tape : Tape 83/1
CC:  Roger. Charging battery A, Fred.

[05:03:22:03]
CC:  And, Fred, request now first reading of voltage -
     BAT A voltage and charger current. Over.

[05:03:22:17]
CMP: Okay, Vance. I can give it to you. I read it
     right after I started it. BAT A voltage was
     39.4 and the current had jumped up to 1.4.

[05:03:22:32]
CC:  Okay. 39.4 and 1.4. Thanks, Jack.

[05:03:22:37]
CMP: Okay. How about - You ready for some other
     readouts, that you wanted there?

[05:03:22:40]
CC:  Ready to copy.

[05:03:22:44]
CMP: Okay. BAT B, 37.0; pyro A, 37.0; pyro B, 37.0;
     [glossary:SPS] helium pressure, 3400; and nitrogen A and B -
     just for throwing it in for kicks, 2200 and 2400,
     respectively; and the injector temperature -
     stand by- The Sun went down. Okay. The injector
     temperature, 5 Charlie, 3.9; 5 Dog, 3.2; 6 Alfa,
     3.6; 6 Baker, 3.9; 6 Charlie, 3.5; 6 Dog, 3.4;
     the battery manifold pressure, 1.4.

[05:03:24:01]
CC:  Okay. We copy all that, Jack. Thank you.

[05:03:24:04]
CMP: Okay.

[05:03:24:20]
CMP: You say, you figure you are going to be charging
     BAT A until about 126?

[05:03:24:32]
CC:  Roger. About [time:05:06:30:00|126:30] is an estimate, Jack.

[05:03:24:40]
CMP: Okay. You figure it will be fully charged then,
     huh?

[05:03:24:43]
CC:  Yes. That's right. We'll have all the batteries
     up to about 116 amps-hours.

[05:03:24:55]
CMP: That's good news.

[05:03:24:58]
CC:  That's better than 99, huh?

[05:03:25:05]
CMP: You're right.

[05:03:25:38]
CMP: How did all our systems look on ..., Vance?

[05:03:25:43]
CC:  I didn't hear any complaints, but just a minute;
     let me make a detailed check.

[05:03:26:42]
_page : 617
_tape : Tape 83/2
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:03:26:47]
CMP: Go ahead.

[05:03:26:48]
CC:  Jack, it's a general statement. It looks like
     temperatures have cooled off in the ballpark of
     6 to 8 degrees cooler than what they were yesterday. Looks like everything is still within
     tolerance, but we're working up a detailed sheet
     of temperatures to send up to you, for your interest.

[05:03:27:16]
CMP: Okay. That sounds good.

[05:03:29:33]
CMP: Houston, Aquarius.

[05:03:29:42]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[05:03:29:45]
CMP: Vance, Joe brought up the alinement at [glossary:EI] minus 2
     plus 30. Were you going to send up or have a
     discussion about that later on.

[05:03:30:00]
CC:  That's correct, Jack. We just about have procedures in hand detail checklist-type procedures
     to send to you. In other words, a time line with
     reference to entry checklist and any changes in
     the entry checklist. So, if you have a few pages
     of scratch paper, why, I think we'll have that to
     you within an hour.

[05:03:30:26]
CMP: Okay. I'll be standing by.

[05:03:30:38]
CC:  One other thing, Jack - You still with me?

[05:03:30:43]
CMP: Yes, go ahead.

[05:03:30:49]
CC:  The stowage people have tried
     out this black-and-white TV camera into B-6 idea
     and they say even with the lens off, they can't
     get it in. So, I still recommend that it be
     stowed where we had it on the list. That's A-7.

[05:03:31:05]
CMP: No problem.

[05:03:32:12]
CMP: All right, go ahead.

[05:03:32:18]
CC:  Jack, request another voltage/readout on BAT A
     and current on BAT charger.

[05:03:36:29]
_page : 618
_tape : Tape 83/3
CMP: Okay, Vance. The volt 39.3, amp 1.3.

[05:03:36:38]
CC:  Roger. Copy 39.3 and 1.3.

[05:03:37:56]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[05:03:38:01]
CMP: Go ahead, Vance.

[05:03:38:03]
CC:  Jack, looks like the [glossary:LM] suit release valve has
     been bumped to AUTO again; request it - -

[05:03:38:12]
CMP: Okay.

[05:03:38:13]
CC:  - - closed. Over.

[05:03:38:44]
CMP: In work.

[05:03:38:45]
CC:  Okay.

[05:03:39:27]
CMP: How's that right there?

[05:03:39:32]
CC:  Okay. They say it looks good.

[05:03:39:34]
CMP: Okay.

[05:03:43:43]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:03:43:49]
CMP: Go ahead.

[05:03:43:50]
CC:  Okay, Jack. We need another one of those voltage
     amps readouts and then maybe we will get off of
     your back for a little while.

[05:03:43:57]
CMP: Oh, don't worry about it. I'd like to have you
     talk with us. Volts and amps coming up.

[05:03:44:02]
CC:  Okay.

[05:03:45:29]
CMP: Okay, Vance. Volts 39.4, amps 1.25.

[05:03:45:38]
CC:  Okay. [glossary:EECOM]'s got it duly recorded.

[05:03:45:45]
CMP: Is John Aaron on?

[05:03:45:53]
CC:  No. Gee, I don't know what shift he is on. But
     he comes in later, I guess.

[05:03:46:13]
_page : 619
_tape : Tape 83/4
CMP: Actually, all the shifts are morning shifts to
     us.

[05:03:46:19]
CC:  Say that one again - -

[05:03:46:21]
CMP: The Sun is always shining - All of the shifts
     are morning shifts to us, because the Sun is
     always shining.

[05:03:46:28]
CC: That was a short night.

[05:03:46:39]
CMP: Just for curiosity's sake, are we still holding
     entry angle at 6.25?

[05:03:46:59]
CC:  Okay. Jack, right now we're told that it's
     closer to 6, and - But they would like to track
     it some more. Looks like your next midcourse
     will be in the order of 2 to 3 foot per second.

[05:03:47:16]
CMP: Okay.

[05:03:54:03]
CMP: I just got a good view of the Southern Cross,
     Alpha and Beta Centauri, and Atria.

[05:03:56:40]
CMP: Houston, 13.

[05:03:56:45]
CC: Go ahead, Jack.

[05:03:56:49]
CMP: Okay. We're still in good shape as far as water
     goes in the [glossary:LM]?

[05:03:56:56]
CC: Okay. We copy.

[05:03:57:11]
CMP: The reason I ask is I'm assuming that we are,
     and I have no idea each time I pressurize the
     surge tank to get water out of the command
     module, how much I drop that surge tank and if
     we are in good shape as far as water goes in
     the [glossary:LM], we'd like to fill a couple of drink bags
     to get some water for drinking purposes.

[05:03:57:37]
CC: Okay. Have you run out of [glossary:CM] drinking water.
     yet, Jack?

[05:03:57:43]
CMP: Oh, no, we've got plenty of drinking water.  I
     think the - I don't have any idea what the surge
     tank pressure is.

[05:03:57:57]
_page : 620
_tape : Tape 83/5
CC:  Okay. It's 750 - -

[05:03:57:58]
CMP: - - and I don't have any - -

[05:03:57:59]
CC:  It's 750, Jack.

[05:03:58:02]
CMP: Okay. 750.

[05:03:58:33]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:03:58:38]
CMP: Go ahead, Vance.

[05:03:58:40]
CC:  Okay. Stand by 1, Jack, and we'll give you an
     indication of how that water situation on the
     [glossary:LM] is - which is your question. Right?

[05:03:58:51]
CMP: Okay. But I guess what I was really asking is,
     if you'd have any violent objections if we filled
     two drink bags from [glossary:LM] water rather than repressurizing the surge tank.

[05:03:59:03]
CC:  Okay. Stand by on that.

[05:03:59:04]
CMP: Also, Jim is asleep up there and we didn't want
     to bother him, either.

[05:03:59:10]
CC:  Okay. We understand.

[05:03:59:18]
CC:  And, Jack, we'll be changing stations in
     1 minute; so, we may have a temporary dropout
     in COMM.

[05:03:59:26]
CMP: Okay.

[05:04:02:09]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:04:02:18]
CMP: Okay, Vance. Go ahead. Loud and clear.

[05:04:02:20]
CC:  Okay, Jack. We're going to bargain with you on
     this one. Instead of two, would - wish that you
     would just get just one bag full. That shouldn't
     do any harm; however - -

[05:04:02:32]
CMP: Okay.

[05:04:02:33]
CC:  - - we are not all that fat on water that we
     want to do any drinking out of the [glossary:LM] as a
     regular thing after this one bag. So would you
     let us know when you get the water out and give
     us a mark on it so we can watch the TM. Over.

[05:04:02:53]
_page : 621
_tape : Tape 83/6
CMP: Okay. Fred-o is about to withdraw the water now.

[05:04:06:01]
CMP: Okay, Vance. We've withdrawn - oh, about 8 ounces
     of water.

[05:04:06:09]
CC:  Okay, Jack. How's it taste?

[05:04:06:18]
CMP: It's - good. It's not quite as gaseous as that
     in the command module.

[05:04:17:16]
CC:  Apollo 13, Houston - or rather, Aquarius, Houston.
     Over.

[05:04:17:23]
CMP: Go ahead.

[05:04:17:25]
CC:  Hey, Jack, we need another reading. Volts and
     amps.

[05:04:17:29]
CMP: Okay. They're coming up.

[05:04:20:10]
CMP: Vance, you won't believe this, but Fred-o says
     it's 39.4 and 1.245.

[05:04:20:19]
CC:  Okay. Our [glossary:EECOM] is recording those numbers.
     Charlie Dumas, this time.

[05:04:20:27]
CMP: Oh.

[05:04:20:36]
CC:  Not changing very fast, is it?

[05:04:20:42]
CMP: How far out are we?

[05:04:20:55]
CC:  Okay. 953 and 6068 on velocity, per [glossary:FIDO].

[05:04:21:02]
CMP: Okay.

[05:04:21:03]
CC:  Bill Stoval.

[05:04:21:04]
CMP: Thank you.

[05:04:38:32]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius. Over

[05:04:38:38]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[05:04:38:42]
CDR: Are the flowers in bloom in Houston?

[05:04:38:45]
CC:  No, not yet. Still must be winter.

[05:04:38:52]
CDR: Suspicions confirmed.

[05:04:38:57]
_page : 622
_tape : Tape 83/7
CC:  Yes, I doubt if they will be blooming even
     Saturday, when you return.

[05:04:39:05]
CDR: I concur.

[05:04:39:07]
CC:  Hey, Jim, we have some photo information to pass
     up to you. Discussed this briefly with Fred
     earlier. It's instructions or suggestions for
     which photos - which cameras and lenses to use
     during your service module photography. Over.

[05:04:39:31]
CDR: Okay. Stand by 1.

[05:04:39:33]
CC:  Okay.

[05:04:39:57]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:04:39:59]
CC:  Okay. We have three cameras here, two of them
     to be used for picture taking from the [glossary:LM], one
     to be used from the number 5 window of the [glossary:CSM].
     First, I'll hit the [glossary:LM] cameras. And this camera
     that I mention now has first priority. It's
     considered the one to give you the best results.
     That's the 70-millimeter DC Reseau camera,
     Hasselblad, that is, with the 80-millimeter lens,
     from box A-13. Suggest fresh magazine of 3400
     black-and-white film.

[05:04:41:02]
CDR: Okay.

[05:04:41:06]
CC:  Okay. Suggest either magazine R or magazine S
     from A-13. Transfer all of this to the [glossary:LM] and
     recommend the following settings: [glossary:LM]/DC/80/BW
     3400 (f:5.6 at a 250th).

[05:04:42:00]
CC:  And that's all for that one.

[05:04:42:04]
CDR: Okay, Vance. Let me see if I have it here. For
     the [glossary:LM], want to use the 70-millimeter DC
     Hasselblad 80-millimeter lens in A-13, using
     3400 black-and-white film MAGs R or S. Prepare
     to take camera to the [glossary:LM], and the setting would
     be the [glossary:LM]/DC/80/BW 3400 (f:5.6) at a 250th.

[05:04:42:28]
CC:  That's correct. Okay. Next: the next camera -
     Stand by 1. I've got noise here. Okay. The
     next [glossary:LM] - The next camera for the [glossary:LM] will be the
     16-millimeter, and these photos are considered
     to be priority 3. Okay. One, get the
     16-millimeter [glossary:DAC] and powerpack from A-8. Get
     the 10-millimeter lens, and remove it - remove
     the 10-millimeter lens, and take the 18-millimeter
     lens from B-3 and attach it to the camera. And
     attach the power cable transfer to the [glossary:LM], set
     frame rate at 12 frames per second, and the same
     data line that I gave you before reads this way
     this time. [glossary:LM]/DAC/18/CEX, battery (f:8 and
     1/250th). Okay. Now looking at these two cameras
     in the [glossary:LM], it's recommended that you use the
     16-millimeter for the first 2-1/2 minutes and
     then switch to the 70-millimeter. That's partly
     because the frame's been - or the - They've been
     optimized for closer and longer range. Okay.
     Read back, please.

[05:04:44:59]
_page : 623
_tape : Tape 83/8
CDR: Okay, Vance. Essentially, what you wanted to
     use as far as the movie camera in the [glossary:LM] goes,
     is our lunar sequence camera which is attached
     to the powerpack. We use the 18-millimeter lens,
     set it at 12 frames per second ... f:8 at 250th
     of a second.

[05:04:45:22]
CC:  Roger. f:8 at 250th.

[05:04:45:30]
CDR: Right; f:8 at 250th.

[05:04:45:35]
CC:  Okay. Would you believe that we have a correction now to the last camera I gave you? Correct
     that 18-millimeter lens to 75-millimeter lens.

[05:04:45:52]
CDR: Okay. The 18-millimeter to the 75-millimeter
     lens. Okay.

[05:04:45:57]
CC:  Right. Okay. Next for the command module pictures, it may be a little hard to see the service
     module from the command module, but if you can
     see it, it will be through window 5, people down
     here think. Recommend for that the [glossary:CM] 70-millimeter. These photos have priority 2. So
     this is 70-millimeter EL, with - which has the
     80-millimeter attached, and this is all in B-3.
     Take off the 80-millimeter lens and attach the
     250-millimeter lens. And the 250-millimeter
     lens can be found in U-4. Use CEX film from
     A-13. Ring sight from A-7, and these pictures
     will be f:8 at a 250th. And I think probably
     by now you probably all have - already have
     these cameras configured, and this may be redundant information, but here it is anyway. Over.

[05:04:47:26]
_page : 624
_tape : Tape 83/9
CDR: Okay, Vance. You're right. We do have cameras
     almost configured like you said. For the command
     module, you think that the EL with the 250 lens,
     CEX film, f:8 at a 250th is the best bet, and
     you're saying now that where you think you'll see
     it is out window 5? Is that it?

[05:04:47:48]
CC:  That's right, Jim.

[05:04:47:52]
CDR: Okay. My procedure, now, after service module
     JETT is going to be to pitch up, in order to try
     to get the service module into the - to get the
     center window in view of the service module,
     which we are going to have somebody there - to
     photograph. Why do you think window 5 will be
     it?

[05:04:48:35]
_extra : END OF TAPE
CC:  Okay. Stand by on that one. This is a question
     of geometry, and I'll get right back.

[05:04:58:10]
_page : 625
_tape : Tape 82/1
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[05:04:58:14]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[05:04:58:16]
CC:  Jim, regarding window 5, I have a drawing here;
     and, when you're docked, you have approximately
     a 60-degree angle between the Z-axes of the two
     spacecraft. It appears that peering out window 5, you would be looking at the rendezvous
     radar on top of the [glossary:LM] which would, if you
     pitched, more or less give you a view of the
     service module. That is, if you pitched, so -
     from - and I think that this has been run by
     quite a few folks here; so, offhand, I can't see
     where any other window would be as good or perhaps even possible.

[05:04:59:12]
CDR: Okay. I understand. Yes, you're right. When
     we look out window 5, we can see rendezvous
     radar, and we'll try - We'll try window 5.

[05:04:59:21]
CC:  Roger. It presumes, though, that there has to
     be a pitch to be able to see it. You guys
     sound a lot more rested today.

[05:04:59:33]
CDR: Well, I just went back and sacked out for an
     hour or so and didn't get back up.

[05:04:59:40]
CC:  Very good.

[05:05:00:51]
CC:  And, Jim, Houston. We really are going to get
     those checklists up to you.

[05:05:00:57]
CDR: Okay.

[05:05:15:07]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[05:05:16:27]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[05:05:16:32]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[05:05:16:33]
CC:  Jim, it's time for readings on the battery
     charging again. Request the BAT A voltage and
     the charger amps. Over.

[05:05:16:43]
CDR: Okay. Stand by, Vance.

[05:05:19:07]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[05:05:19:09]
_page : 626
_tape : Tape 84/2
CC: Go ahead, Jim.

[05:05:19:12]
CDR: Okay. We have no more water in the potable tank.
     We tried to get some more out a few minutes ago,
     and there isn't any.

[05:05:19:21]
CC:  Okay. Understand you ran out of water in the
     [glossary:CM] potable tank.

[05:05:19:27]
CDR: Affirmative.

[05:05:25:17]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[05:05:25:50]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[05:05:25:54]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[05:05:25:56]
CC:  Jim, we - you were able to get those voltage -
     BAT A voltage and current readings?

[05:05:26:02]
CDR: Oh, yes. Fred's - Fred's up there now.

[05:05:26:05]
CC:  Okay. And we're ready to read you the first
     checklist installment. This will - What we're
     going to readup is going to be a [glossary:LM] time line,
     a [glossary:CSM] time line, and checklist changes to conform with these. And right now I have the first
     installment of the [glossary:CSM] time line ready to read
     up. Over.

[05:05:26:37]
CDR: Okay, Jack. I'm going to get - Vance, I'm going
     to get Jack on the line for that; and so stand
     by.

[05:05:26:43]
CC:  Okay. And he'll need a lot of paper.

[05:05:26:50]
CDR: Okay. Volts are 39.5; amps, 1.24. Stand by.

[05:05:27:01]
CC:  Okay. We got it.

[05:05:27:28]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:05:27:50]
CMP: Okay, Vance. I'm on and ready to copy.

[05:05:27:54]
CC:  Okay, Jack. Wait 1. We want to get one into
     the hands of FLIGHT and [glossary:EECOM], and it'll take
     about a minute or 2. Sorry to wake you up for
     this, but take about a minute, and then we'll
     read it up to you.

[05:05:30:07]
_page : 627
_tape : Tape 84/3
CC: Aquarius, Houston.

[05:05:30:12]
CMP: Okay, Vance. Go ahead.

[05:05:30:14]
CC:  Okay, Jack. Do you have any of that [glossary:CM] water -
     bagged water, left? Over.

[05:05:30:22]
CMP: Negative. I went up and tried to repressurize
     the surge tank and get another shot of water,
     and was able to repressurize the surge tank okay,
     but there was no water that came out of the water
     tank.

[05:05:30:36]
CC:  Yes. We understand that there isn't any more
     in the potable tank, but we understood that you
     had put some water from that tank into bags,
     and I wondered if any of the bags were left.

[05:05:30:48]
CMP: Negative.

[05:05:30:50]
CC:  Okay.

[05:05:33:42]
CC:  Okay, Jack. Ready to copy?

[05:05:33:49]
CMP: Okay, Vance. Ready to copy.

[05:05:33:51]
CC:  Okay. Start at [glossary:EI] minus 6-1/2 hours. You're
     going to re - get [glossary:LM] pads and [glossary:CSM] pads, and I
     don't know if you want to copy them or not.
     This is something I can just read off to you.
     Over. Without you copying unless you especially
     want it.

[05:05:34:17]
CMP: Okay.

[05:05:34:19]
CC:  Okay. [glossary:LM] pad, [glossary:SM] jettison - -

[05:05:34:25]
CMP: Okay. Go ahead; read which ones we're going to
     get.

[05:05:34:28]
CC:  Okay. I'll read them fast first here so you
     get a general idea. [glossary:LM] pad, service module
     JETT attitude, Moon viewing attitude, Sun
     viewing attitude, and [glossary:LM] JETT attitude. The
     [glossary:CM] pads are coarse aline angles for [glossary:LM] attitudes
     during Moon and Sun sightings, coarse aline
     angles for entry [glossary:REFSMMAT], and [glossary:CMC] angles on
     entry [glossary:REFSMMAT] for [glossary:LM] JETT. Moon viewing, and
     entry. Okay. That - That's general pad information. If you want, I'll read it slowly so you
     can copy it all down; otherwise, I'll go ahead.

[05:05:35:30]
_page : 628
_tape : Tape 84/4
CMP: I got - I was trying to copy it as you were
     reading it, Vance. The [glossary:LM] pads are service
     module jettison attitude, Moon viewing attitude,
     Sun viewing attitude, and [glossary:LM] jettison attitude.
     Is that correct?

[05:05:35:44]
CC:  That's correct. Okay. I'll read the [glossary:CM] pads
     now, slowly. Coarse aline angles for [glossary:LM] attitudes
     during Moon and Sun sightings.

[05:05:36:21]
CC:  Okay. The next coarse aline angles for entry
     [glossary:REFSMMAT]. Okay. The next, [glossary:CMC] angles on entry
     [glossary:REFSMMAT] for (1) [glossary:LM] JETT, (2) Moon viewing,
     (3) entry. Okay. I'll stand by until you read
     that back.

[05:05:37:37]
CMP: Okay. The [glossary:CSM] pads will be coarse aline angles
     for [glossary:LM] attitudes during Moon and Sun sightings.
     Coarse aline angles for entry [glossary:REFSMMAT]. [glossary:CMC] -
     [glossary:CMC] angles on entry [glossary:REFSMMAT] for (1) [glossary:LM] jettison,
     (2) Moon viewing, (3) entry.

[05:05:38:07]
CC:  Okay. That's correct.

[05:05:38:43]
CC:  Okay, Jack. Going to hold up 1. All the hordes
     of people that devised this procedure are going
     to be coming into the room in a minute, and
     they'd like to hold up until everybody can listen
     in.

[05:05:39:24]
CC:  Get that, Jack?

[05:05:39:50]
CMP: Okay, Vance. We're ready to go.

[05:05:39:54]
CC:  Okay. We lost you there briefly while you were
     in an attitude where we couldn't receive you.
     Jack, we'd like to hold off for about 5 minutes.
     We have some more people coming in to listen to
     this, and it took a lot of people to devise this
     procedure, and a few people have been testing it
     out, so we'd like to have them all on hand while
     we give you the rest.

[05:05:40:21]
CMP: Okay.

[05:05:40:28]
F: How's the temperature up there, Jack? You guys
     chopping wood to keep warm?

[05:05:40:34]
CMP: Deke, it's about 51, I think, or 50 in the [glossary:LM],
     and it's about - I don't know - 45 or little
     bit less in the command module.

[05:05:40:49]
_page : 629
_tape : Tape 84/5
F: Oh, it's a nice fall day, huh?

[05:05:40:54]
CMP: Yes, I tell you, we don't have to worry about
     chilldown.

[05:05:43:30]
CMP: Okay, Vance. While we're waiting, do you have
     there also what I can expect ground to uplink
     me?

[05:05:43:44]
CC:  We'll have that, Jack, but - Stand by for that.

[05:05:43:52]
CMP: Okay.

[05:05:44:08]
CC:  Jack, probably - probably the thing to do is to
     give you all of the checklist, and it will
     include things like this. Then we'll have a
     big question and answer session afterwards, if
     that's okay by you.

[05:05:44:24]
CMP: Okay. That sounds good.

[05:05:46:52]
CMP: Okay, Vance. While we're waiting, just for
     your information, the command module has been
     stowed per your checklist with the exception of
     the two Hasselblad cameras.

[05:05:47:11]
F: Roger. Got that, Jack.

[05:05:47:22]
CMP: And the [glossary:LM] is pretty well stowed with the
     exception when we have yet to bring in the
     probe and the drogue.

[05:05:47:31]
F: Roger. Got that.

[05:05:47:55]
F: Relative to your water situation, Jack, we're
     going to have a pretty good hack on the [glossary:LM] here
     in the next few hours, and we anticipate letting
     you fill your own tanks before we transfer over,
     so you should be in reasonably good shape there.

[05:05:48:12]
CMP: Okay. We have a number of juice bags all out
     and ready to go, and we tried to get the water
     out of the command module about 20 minutes ago
     and found out that the command module's potable
     tank was empty. So we have no bags made up now,
     so we're dependent on [glossary:LM] water, [glossary:PLSS] water.

[05:05:48:39]
F: Roger. If you feel like trying the [glossary:PLSS], that's
     all excess, and you might want to try that at
     any time. I'm sure it'll taste like [glossary:PLSS] but
     you might as well try it.

[05:05:48:57]
_page : 630
_tape : Tape 84/6
CMP: Okay.

[05:05:50:28]
CMP: Okay, Deke. All the windows in the command
     module are heavily coated with water right now.
     So I don't know what kind of pictures we'll get
     out of them, but I'm going to try and clean them
     off and do the best I can with the 250-millimeter
     lens on the Hasselblad.

[05:05:50:47]
F: Roger. That's why we have the top priority
     stuff in the [glossary:LM]. We figure you've got a much
     better chance of getting it through there.

[05:05:50:55]
CMP: Okay.

[05:05:53:24]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:05:53:29]
CMP: Are you ready to send it up, Vance?

[05:05:53:31]
CC:  Jack, before we start reading the procedure,
     we'd like - We find that BAT A is topped off
     and in great shape. Like to switch over and
     top off BAT B some more. Give it 2 more hours
     of charging. Have about a seven- or eight-step
     procedure here to give you, if you want to copy
     that. We're switching before we start recording
     the entry procedures.

[05:05:53:58]
CMP: Okay. Stand by and let me get out my other
     checklist.

[05:05:54:14]
CMP: Okay, Vance. Ready to copy.

[05:05:54:19]
CC:  Okay. Panel 3: switch BATTERY CHARGE to OFF.
     Panel 5; MAIN BUS TIE BAT A/C to BAT A/C; CB
     BATTERY CHARGER, BAT A CHARGE to open; CB
     BATTERY CHARGER, BAT B CHARGE, close. Next,
     panel 250; CB BAT B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING to
     close. Panel 5; MAIN BUS TIE, BAT B/C, off.
     Panel 3; BATTERY CHARGE to B. Advise; well,
     stand by. Jack, advise that we have a backout
     procedure for this, but we'll read that up to
     you later, in about 2 hours. And, also, that
     this procedure is a DELTA to your - the first
     battery charging procedure that we gave you.
     In other words, it's a DELTA from where you are
     right now.

[05:05:57:10]
_page : 631
_tape : Tape 84/7
CMP: Okay. This is the procedure for charging BAT
     Baker. Panel 3; BAT CHARGE, OFF; panel 5; MAIN
     BUS TIE, BAT A/C to A/C; CB BAT CHARGER, BAT A
     CHARGE, open; CB BAT CHARGER, BAT B CHARGE,
     close. Panel 250; CB BAT B POWER ENTRY and
     POSTLANDING, close. Panel 5; MAIN BUS TIE, BAT
     B/C, to OFF; Panel 3; BAT CHARGE to B. This is
     a DELTA for the first battery charging procedure;
     you'll give me the backout procedure in a couple
     hours.

[05:05:57:47]
CC:  That's affirm.

[05:05:57:51]
CMP: Okay. I'll put it in work right now, then come
     back and stand by to copy the rest of - well,
     I - not the rest - everything.

[05:05:58:01]
CC:  Everything is right.

[05:05:58:13]
CC:  You'd never believe how much this procedure's
     been massaged in the last day.

[05:06:02:41]
CMP: Okay, Vance. I put BAT Baker on charge; I don't
     think it quite had stabilized. It was reading
     1.1 amps, 39.6 volts when I left up there.

[05:06:03:02]
CC:  Okay. We got that.

[05:06:03:07]
CMP: Okay. I guess now is as good a time to start
     as any.

[05:06:03:21]
CC:  Just a second, Jack.

[05:06:04:45]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:06:04:50]
CMP: Okay, Vance. You're kind of weak, but readable.

[05:06:04:54]
CC:  Jack, we're going to need readings on the BAT
     volt and charger amps about every 10 or 15 minutes for a while, so is there somebody else that
     can be reading them out while you're copying?
     Over.

[05:06:05:10]
CMP: Yes. Jim will take a run up there. Fred-o is
     sleeping right now. We're trying to get some
     sleep here, and Jim'll run up and take a look
     at voltage and current whenever you call.

[05:06:05:22]
CC:  Okay.

[05:06:06:34]
_page : 632
_tape : Tape 84/8
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[05:06:06:37]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[05:06:06:40]
CDR: Vance, we've got to realize that we've got to
     establish a work-rest cycle up here, so we just
     can't wait around here to just read procedures
     all the time up to the burn. We've got to get
     them up here, look at them, and then we've got
     to get the people to sleep. So take that into
     consideration when you get ready to send up
     the pads.

[05:06:07:01]
CC:  I know, Jim. We're very conscious of that.
     We - we should be ready to go in about 5 minutes.
     That's all I can say. Stand by.

[05:06:07:16]
CDR: Okay.

[05:06:11:48]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:06:11:53]
CMP: Okay, Vance. We're ready to go.

[05:06:11:56]
CC:  Okay. We need a - Sorry (laughter). We need
     a readout. Volts and amps.

[05:06:12:05]
CMP: Okay. In work.

[05:06:12:10]
CC:  And, might as well bring the COMM up to a higher
     fidelity for this long period of checklist
     reading. That requires, panel 16: CB PRIMARY
     S-BAND POWER AMP, closed.

[05:06:12:37]
CMP: Okay, PRIMARY S-BAND POWER AMP closed now. How
     do you read?

[05:06:12:40]
CC:  Okay. And next step, panel 12: S-BAND FUNCTION
     to VOICE and RANGING FUNCTION to RANGING.

[05:06:13:25]
CMP: Okay, Vance. The S-BAND FUNCTION is at VOICE
     and the RANGING switch was at RANGING.

[05:06:13:32]
CC:  Okay. That makes it so we can hear you better,
     Jack.

[05:06:13:41]
CMP: Okay. Can we - Since the first part of it, you're
     just going to read and I'm going to copy and
     we're going to have a question and answer period
     later, can we get started?

[05:06:13:52]
_page : 633
_tape : Tape 84/9
CC: Okay. Procedure's coming back in again. Multicopies for distribution. And Ken's back. He's
     a local expert on this now, so we'll turn you
     over to him and he'll read it off.

[05:06:14:07]
CMP: Okay. Stand by. I'll give you volts and amps.
     Okay. The voltage is 39.1; amps, 1.75.

[05:06:14:20]
CC:  Okay.

[05:06:14:43]

CC:  Okay. Let me take it from the top here. Just -
     there might be some overlap, but to make sure
     we're all on the same signal. We're starting
     off with a set of time line procedures that are
     going to give us - end up with the normal entry
     checklist. There will be some checklist changes
     into the book, but the bulk of what I have for
     you is the time line stuff. And it starts at
     6 hours and 30 minutes prior to [glossary:EI] and assumes
     that we're getting [glossary:LM] power to MAIN B in the
     command module. I think you already have the
     numbers for the [glossary:LM] pads and the command module
     pads; I mean the types of pads we'll be giving
     you. And if you have a question on what they'll
     be doing or what they're for, I can go over
     those now or when we get through.

[05:06:15:42]
CMP: Okay. Yes, I'll make a little note there, and
     we'll discuss it when we get everything copied,
     huh?

[05:06:15:50]
CC:  All right. And the first item, then, after
     you get ready to start this checklist, is to
     install lithium hydroxide canisters and to stow
     [glossary:ORDEAL]. On panel 8, we want to turn the
     FLOODLIGHTS to FIXED.

[05:06:16:08]
CMP: Okay. Wait a minute. You're going too fast,
     here.

[05:06:16:11]
CC:  Okay. I'll tell you. I'll go line at a time
     and wait for your verification before I go on to
     the next one. I have panel 8, FLOODLIGHTS,
     FIXED,

[05:06:16:38]
_page : 634
_tape : Tape 84/10
CC: Okay. Install LiOH canisters, stow [glossary:ORDEAL],
     FLOODLIGHTS, FIXED.

[05:06:16:42]
CC: Okay. That's the panel 8 floodlights. Now
     we're going to take panel 5 and put the FLOODLIGHT
     rheostat to FLOOD and the [glossary:LEB], that's panel 100,
     FLOODLIGHTS are also going to FIXED. And the
     purpose of this is to balance up buses A and B.

[05:06:17:05]
CMP: Okay. Panel 5; FLOODLIGHTS; you want the rheostat on. Panel 100, FLOODLIGHTS; you want FIXED.

[05:06:17:14]
CC:  That's affirmative. Okay. On panel 8: circuit
     breakers EMS, MAIN A and MAIN B, that's two,
     open.

[05:06:17:47]
CMP: Okay. Panel 8: [glossary:EMS] MAIN A and MAIN B, open.

[05:06:17:51]
CC:  Okay. On panel 250: circuit breaker BATTERY A
     POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, closed.

[05:06:18:14]
CMP: Okay. Panel 250: CB BAT A POWER ENTRY and
     POSTLANDING, closed.

[05:06:18:20]
CC:  Okay. The same for circuit breaker BATTERY B

[05:06:18:39]
CMP: Okay. BATTERY B POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING,
     closed.

[05:06:18:42]
CC:  Okay. And add BATTERY C POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING.

[05:06:19:00]
CMP: BATTERY C POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, closed.

[05:06:19:03]
CC:  Okay. That's correct. On panel 5: circuit

CC:  Okay. And the same for circuit breaker for
     BATTERY CHARGE, BAT B/CHARGE, closed.

[05:06:19:52]
CMP: Okay, BAT CHARGER, BAT B, closed.

[05:06:19:56]
CC:  All right. Like to take MAIN BUS TIES, two of
     them, on and up. That's probably a verify.

[05:06:20:16]
CMP: MAIN BUS TIES A/C and B/C, on, verify.

[05:06:20:21]
_page : 635
_tape : Tape 84/11
CC:  That's correct. Circuit breaker BATTERY RELAY
     BUS, BATTERY A and B, closed.

[05:06:21:18]
CC:  Okay. On panel 275: circuit breaker MAIN A,
     BATTERY C, closed.

[05:06:21:37]
CMP: Okay, Ken. Wait on that one here. I'm just
     about to lose you here. Just - I've got to
     change OMNIs.

[05:06:21:42]
CC:  Okay.

[05:06:21:47]
CMP: Okay. Could you give me that one again, please.

[05:06:21:50]
CC:  All right. On panel 275: circuit breaker MAIN A,
     BATTERY C, closed.

[05:06:22:05]
CMP: Okay. MAIN A, BAT B, closed on 275.

[05:06:22:09]
CC:  That's MAIN A, BATTERY C, Charlie.

[05:06:22:15]
CMP: MAIN A, BAT C, Charlie.

[05:06:22:20]
CC:  That's affirm. No - Negative on battery Bravo.

[05:06:22:27]
CMP: Okay. Negative on battery Bravo. That's MAIN A,
     BAT Charlie, closed.

[05:06:22:32]
CC:  Okay. Good. On panel 276: circuit breaker
     INSTRUMENTATION POWER CONTROL, 3 and 4, open.

[05:06:22:49]
CMP: Would you say that one again, Ken?

[05:06:22:51]
CC:  All right. On panel 276: circuit breaker
     INSTRUMENTATION POWER CONTROL, 3 and 4, open.

[05:06:23:17]
CMP: Okay. Panel 276: CB INSTRUMENTATION POWER
     CONTROL, 3 and 4, open.

[05:06:23:24]
CC:  That's affirmative. Okay. Panel 5: circuit
     breaker CENTRAL INSTRUMENTATION POWER, MAIN B,
     closed.

[05:06:23:51]
_page : 636
_tape : Tape 84/12
CMP: Okay. On panel 5: ...

[05:06:23:59]
CC:  Okay. I'm sorry, Jack. Would you read that
     again, please?

[05:06:24:03]
CMP: Okay. On panel 5: CB CENTRAL INSTRUMENTATION
     POWER, MAIN B, closed.

[05:06:24:10]
CC:  Okay. That's correct. PRIMARY EVAPORATE WATER
     CONTROL valve to AUTO.

[05:06:24:24]
CMP: This is on 382?

[05:06:24:27]
CC:  That's affirmative.

[05:06:24:28]
CMP: Wha - Wha -

[05:06:24:30]
CC:  Okay, Jack. We want to put the PRIMARY and the
     SECONDARY EVAPORATED WATER CONTROL valves to
     AUTO.

[05:06:24:37]
CMP: Okay.

[05:06:24:52]
CC:  And, Jack, can you give us a readout on BAT B
     and the charger current?

[05:06:25:14]
CMP: Okay, Ken. That was the PRIMARY and SECONDARY
     H<sub>2</sub>O CONTROL valves to AUTO on 382.

[05:06:25:20]
CC:  That's affirmative, and did you copy about the
     readout on the battery and charger?

[05:06:25:25]
CMP: Yes. Jim's on his way up.

[05:06:25:27]
CC:  Okay. Thank you. All right, the next little
     step after your water control valves is to perform the [glossary:CSM] [glossary:RCS] preheat. We'll do that on
     page E/1-5, steps 35 and 37.

[05:06:25:53]
CMP: Okay, Ken. We're having a problem with the COMM.
     You read now?

[05:06:25:57]
CC:  Yes, sir. Loud and clear.

[05:06:26:04]
CMP: Okay. It's perform [glossary:CM] - [glossary:CSM] [glossary:RCS] preheat, and
     could you say again all after?

[05:06:26:11]
CC:  Okay. I'm referring to the entry checklist,
     page E/1-5, steps 35 and 37.

[05:06:26:33]
_page : 637
_tape : Tape 84/13
CMP: Okay.  Perform [glossary:CSM] [glossary:RCS] preheat per entry checklist, page 1-5, steps 35 and 37.

[05:06:26:43]
CC: That's affirmative. Now back to panel 5:
     circuit breaker CAUTION AND WARNING, MAIN B,
     closed.

[05:06:26:59]
CMP: CB CAUTION AND WARNING, MAIN B, closed.

[05:06:27:02]
CC:  That's affirm. On panel 2: CAUTION AND WARNING
     POWER to 1.

[05:06:27:15]
CMP: Panel 2: CAUTION AND WARNING POWER to 1.

[05:06:27:20]
CC:  That was POWER to number 1, Jack.

[05:06:27:26]
CMP: CAUTION AND WARNING POWER to 1.

[05:06:27:29]
_extra : END OF TAPE/nAPOLLO 13 AIR-TO-GROUND VOICE TRANSCRIPT
CC:  Okay. On panel 5: circuit breaker [glossary:EPS] SENSOR
     UNIT, DC BUS A and B, closed.

[05:06:27:50]
_page : 638
_tape : Tape 85/1
CMP: Okay, Ken. The COMM from you is awful weak -
     awful weak, I - I can't - it's CB [glossary:EPS] SENSOR
     UNIT. Say again, after that.

[05:06:27:59]
CC:  All right, Jack. That's CB [glossary:EPS] SENSOR UNIT, DC,
     that's Delta Charlie, BUS A and B, closed.

[05:06:28:16]
CMP: Okay. CB [glossary:EPS] SENSOR UNIT, DC BUS A and B, close.
     And I'll give you the volts and amps.

[05:06:28:27]
CC:  Okay, that's correct. Go ahead.

[05:06:28:29]
CMP: Okay. Volts are 39.1; amps, 1.5.

[05:06:28:45]
CC: Okay. On panel 3: MAIN BUS A and B, go to
     RESET and leave it in the center.

[05:06:29:06]
CMP: Okay, panel 3 - Stand by; got to change OMNI's.

[05:06:29:19]
CMP: Okay. MAIN BUS A and B, RESET, then center.

[05:06:29:27]
CC:  That's affirmative. Okay, now we're at [glossary:EI]
     minus 5 plus 05. And, as far as you're concerned,
     Jack, the command module is using this for information only. This will be the [glossary:LM] doing an Earth-terminator [glossary:AGS] alinement; and at the time of
     5 plus 05 is the time they'll be going ahead and
     releasing their ball. And this will be covered
     in the [glossary:LM] checklist; it'll be uplinked after this
     one. At [glossary:EI] minus 5, we perform midcourse number 7. Over.

[05:06:30:16]
CMP: Okay. At [glossary:EI] minus 05:05, the [glossary:LM] is making an
     Earth-terminator aline; and at [glossary:EI] minus 05:00,
     we perform [glossary:MCC]-7.

[05:06:30:27]
CC:  That's correct. At the completion of midcourse 7, the [glossary:LM] will maneuver to a separation
     attitude. And this attitude will be sent up
     on one of the pads that you're going to get
     before all the sequence starts. And it'll be
     flown to the [glossary:LM] ball angles on that pad.

[05:06:30:47]
CMP: Okay. Understand.

[05:06:30:50]
CC:  All right. At [glossary:EI] minus 4 plus 40, we want to
     perform page 1-6, step 39 of the entry checklist.

[05:06:31:07]
_page : 639
_tape : Tape 85/2
CMP: Ken, I - I didn't get it. We had to change
     OMNI's again. Could you say it - the [glossary:EI] minus
     4 dash - or 04:40, we do something.

[05:06:31:15]
CC:  Okay. And at that time, you'll want to perform
     step 39 of page E/1-6. Over.

[05:06:31:31]
CMP: Okay. Perform step 39 of entry checklist
     page E/1-6.

[05:06:31:39]
CC:  That's correct. Okay. The next is the command
     module [glossary:RCS] activation, and that's step 4-1 of
     page E/1-6.

[05:06:32:13]
CMP: Okay. The next is perform [glossary:CSM] - or [glossary:CM] [glossary:RCS] activation for step 4-1 of page E - E/1-6.

[05:06:32:28]
CC:  That's correct.

[05:06:32:41]
CC: All right, Jack. The next is at [glossary:EI] minus 4
     plus 30. We want to verify that the [glossary:LM] is
     configured for command module [glossary:RCS] hotfire.

[05:06:33:08]
CMP: Okay. Verify [glossary:LM] configure for [glossary:RCS] hotfire at
     [glossary:EI] minus 04:30.

[05:06:33:16]
CC:  That's correct. Now to panel 5: circuit
     breaker G&N [glossary:IMU] HEATER, MAIN B, closed.

[05:06:33:41]
CMP: Okay. Panel 5: CB G&N [glossary:IMU] HEATER, MAIN A and
     MAIN B, closed.

[05:06:33:49]
CC: That's negative, Jack. That's MAIN B only.

[05:06:33:59]
CMP: Okay. MAIN B only.

[05:06:34:02]
CC:  I'm sorry; I lost you that time. Say it again.

[05:06:34:08]
CMP: Okay. Let's repeat it. Stand by. Cut out.
     We've really got a strange attitude, so this is
     why we are having the COMM problem. Panel 5:
     CB G&N [glossary:IMU] HEATER, MAIN B, closed.

[05:06:34:24]
CC:  That's affirmative. On panel 1: ROTATION CONTROL
     POWER, NORMAL. That's two of them, to AC/DC.

[05:06:34:42]
CMP: Okay, panel 1: RHC, NORMAL, two to AC/DC, two
     controllers.

[05:06:34:48]
CC:  That's correct. On panel 7: [glossary:SCS], LOGIC POWER
     2/3, ON.

[05:06:35:03]
_page : 640
_tape : Tape 85/3
CMP: [glossary:SCS], LOGIC POWER 2/3, ON, panel 7.

[05:06:35:09]
CC:  That's affirm. Back to panel 2: [glossary:RCS] COMMAND,
     ON.

[05:06:35:20]
CMP: Panel 2: [glossary:RCS] COMMAND, ON.

[05:06:35:25]
CC:  That's correct. Now the command module [glossary:RCS]
     check per step 4 of page E/2-1.

[05:06:35:44]
CMP: Okay. Perform the command module [glossary:RCS] check per
     step 4, page 2-1.

[05:06:35:49]
CC:  That's correct. Okay, at this point, we want to
     lock the rotation hand controllers.

[05:06:36:09]
CMP: Okay. After that, lock both rotation hand controllers.

[05:06:36:14]
CC:  That's affirm. On panel 8: SEQUENTIAL, PYRO
     ARM, two to ARM.

[05:06:36:37]
CMP: Okay. Panel 8: set PYRO ARM, two, to ARM. Do
     I get a [glossary:MSFN] GO for that?

[05:06:36:43]
CC: That's negative, Jack. We haven't powered up
     any of the downlink at this time. You'll be
     doing this and the command module [glossary:RCS] pressurization both by yourself.

[05:06:36:57]
CMP: Okay.

[05:06:37:00]
CC:  Okay. Now, the next event is going to be the
     separation of the service module, and these are
     some [glossary:LM] steps, but so that you will know what is
     going on, I'll read them to you. The [glossary:LM] will do
     a [glossary:LM] plus-X of one-half foot per second. Then
     you'll be hitting the [glossary:CM] [glossary:SM] SEP on and up, on
     their command. As soon as we are free of the
     service module, the [glossary:LM] will do another [glossary:LM]
     minus-X for 0.5 feet per second. This is called
     the push-pull maneuver. I think it was described
     this afternoon.

[05:06:37:46]
CMP: Yes, Ken. It was, I heard about it.

[05:06:37:49]
CC:  Okay. I just wanted you to know that's the
     sequence you're in. Okay. At the completion of
     that, we go back to panel 8, and it's SEQUENTIAL,
     PYRO ARM, both of them, to SAFE.

[05:06:38:16]
CMP: Okay. Panel 8: SEQ PYRO ARM, two, to SAFE.

[05:06:38:28]
_page : 641
_tape : Tape 85/4
CC: Okay. And following this, we take SEQUENTIAL,
     LOGIC, two, to OFF.

[05:06:38:43]
CMP: Okay. LOGIC, two, to OFF.

[05:06:38:48]
CC:  I'm sorry, Jack. I'll have to ask you to repeat
     that.

[05:06:38:58]
CMP: Okay. Panel 8: SEQ LOGIC, two, to OFF. Are
     they ON now, Ken? I don't remember turning them -
     I guess that's part of one of the other sequences,
     huh? That we turned them ON?

[05:06:39:08]
CC:  That's affirm. The reason we're turning the
     logic off, Jack, is a power savings. So we'll
     be turning them off, and I'll ge getting them
     back on when we go to get off of the [glossary:LM]; and
     then turn them back off, then we'll be turning
     them on prior to entry. Just so you know what's
     coming.

[05:06:39:25]
CMP: Okay, real fine.

[05:06:39:28]
CC:  Okay. Then following this, the [glossary:LM] will pitch up
     to acquire the Moon - Excuse me, they're going to
     pitch up and acquire the service module and photograph, and they'll be using the ACA for rotations
     from now on. And you may see the [glossary:LM] out of window
     number 5 at the same time they pitch up to acquire
     it.

[05:06:40:02]
CMP: Okay. The [glossary:LM] pitches up, acquires the service
     module and photographs it, and I should expect
     to find - might possibly see the service module
     out of window 5.

[05:06:40:12]
CC:  That's affirmative. Okay, now we're down to [glossary:EI]
     minus 3 hours, or the next time-event, and the [glossary:LM]
     starts a maneuver to what we call the Moon-view
     attitude. This maneuver is designed to place
     the command module optics pointing with zero
     zero at the Moon, and it will be flown to on the
     [glossary:LM] ball angle.

[05:06:40:57]
CMP: Okay, the [glossary:LM] maneuvers to the Moon-viewing attitude which would place the Moon in the center of
     the command module optics with them at zero zero.

[05:06:41:08]
CC:  That's affirmative. Okay, now we're going to
     panel 5, and it's circuit breaker G&N, COMPUTER,
     MAIN B, closed.

[05:06:41:21]
CMP: Okay. Panel 5: CB G&N, COMPUTER, MAIN B, closed.

[05:06:41:35]
_page : 642
_tape : Tape 85/5
CC: That's affirmative. Now you're going to come
     up with a 37 ENTER 06 ENTER most likely on the
     computer. And what we want to do is to put the
     computer to standby; if you come up with a
     37 06, you'll have to do an ENTER in order to
     get the code 62. If it's got 62 on it, you can
     do a PROCEED until the [glossary:DSKY] blanks. You might
     remember that the AC is still off at this time
     so you won't be getting the STANDBY status light,
     and your cue that the computer is indeed in
     standby is when the [glossary:DSKY] goes blank.

[05:06:42:16]
CMP: Okay. You're saying that I will probably get
     a PROGRAM 06 with a [glossary:VERB 37] ENTER flashing.

[05:06:42:27]
CC: I expect that you - -

[05:06:42:28]
CMP: ENTER 06.

[05:06:42:29]
CC:  I expect you are - -

[05:06:42:30]
CMP: Say again, Ken.

[05:06:42:32]
CC:  Yes. We think that you're going to come up
     with a 37 06 already in the [glossary:DSKY]. If you do,
     do an ENTER and that should take you to the
     code 00062, which is the request for standby.
     And when you get that, hit PROCEED until the
     [glossary:DSKY] blanks. If you come up with something
     else, that's where we want to end up anyhow.
     With either, when you get the code 62 when it
     comes up, just do a PROCEED on it.

[05:06:43:05]
CMP: Okay. Is there anything else I could get?

[05:06:43:12]
CC: I don't believe so, Jack. That's one that when
     you get to that step, if you do get something
     else, we will be standing by to see that you
     see. The whole scheme is to go to standby.

[05:06:43:23]
CMP: Will you be getting it on downlink?

[05:06:43:25]
CC:  No, sir. We don't have that powered up yet.

[05:06:43:29]
CMP: Okay. I'll yell to Jim, and Jim will give you
     a call.

[05:06:43:33]
CC:  Okay. The basic thing, Jack, is just to get
     the computer in standby to save power.

[05:06:43:40]
CMP: Okay.

[05:06:43:41]
_page : 643
_tape : Tape 85/6
CC:  And we need another battery B readout.

[05:06:43:56]
CMP: Okay. He is on his way. Go ahead.

[05:06:43:58]
CC:  Okay. Now, we're at [glossary:EI] minus 2 plus 30; we're
     going to panel 5: circuit breaker ESSENTIAL
     INSTRUMENTATION, MAIN A, closed.

[05:06:44:20]
CMP: Okay, CB ESSENTIAL INSTRUMENTATION, MAIN A,
     closed.

[05:06:44:25]
CC: That's correct. Now circuit breaker G&N, [glossary:IMU]
     HEATER, MAIN A, closed.

[05:06:44:42]
CMP: CB G&N, [glossary:IMU] HEATER, MAIN A, closed.

[05:06:44:47]

     of sequence. Would you put that COMPUTER, MAIN A,
     ahead of [glossary:LM] POWER?

[05:06:45:51]
CMP: Okay, Ken. That's CB G&N, COMPUTER, MAIN A,
     closed, goes before CB [glossary:LM] POWER-1 and -2, open.

[05:06:45:59]
CC:  That's correct. Jack, what we're doing is we've
     had the [glossary:LM] powering MAIN B, and we've had all
     these particular loads on it, and we're getting
     ready to secure [glossary:LM] power so we wanted to make
     sure that essential things like the computer,
     the platform, and all have dioded power supplies
     before we remove the [glossary:LM] power.

[05:06:46:19]

[05:06:56:18]
CMP: Okay, G&N POWER switch to AC2.

[05:06:56:22]
CC:  That's correct. Now we want to perform the
     [glossary:CMC] powerup per the [glossary:CSM] G&C checklist, G 2-2.

[05:06:56:44]
CMP: Perform [glossary:CMC] powerup per the G&C checklist,
     page 2-2.

[05:06:56:50]
CC:  That's correct. Perform the [glossary:EMS] check, step 32
     of the entry book, page 1-4.

[05:06:57:16]
CMP: Okay. Perform the [glossary:EMS] check per step 32 per
     the entry checklist, page 1-4.

[05:06:57:26]
CC:  That's correct. Okay, now the ground is going
     to give you a [glossary:P27] update, at [glossary:EI] minus 2 plus 15.
     That's a - that's a time that you need to be
     configured to accept up telemetry. And what
     they're going to give you on a [glossary:P27] update will
     by a clock increment, a state vector; they'll
     give you a [glossary:VERB 66]; they'll give you two
     [glossary:REFSMMAT]s, there'll be an actual and a preferred;
     and the entry target load. Now, if you'd like.
     to copy those, I can take it a little slower.

[05:06:58:13]
_page : 647
_tape : Tape 85/10
CMP: No, I've got them. They are going to give me a
     clock DELTA, state vector, [glossary:VERB 66], two
     [glossary:REFSMMAT]s, and an entry target load.

[05:06:58:20]
CC:  That's correct. Okay, and then we'll do - -

[05:06:58:24]
CMP: There isn't much else they could give me, is
     there, Ken?

[05:06:58:28]
CC:  No, not very much. How about [glossary:IMU] powerup according to the G&C checklist, G/2-1.

[05:06:58:50]
CMP: Okay. Perform [glossary:IMU] powerup per G&C checklist,
     page 2-1.

[05:06:58:58]
CC:  That's correct. And while you are there, you
     can do the optics powerup on G/2-3.

[05:06:59:21]
CMP: Perform the optics powerup per page 2-3.

[05:06:59:25]
CC:  That's correct; and on panel 229: circuit
     breaker TIMERS, MAIN A, closed.

[05:06:59:46]
CMP: Okay. Panel 229: CB TIMER, MAIN A, closed.

[05:06:59:52]
CC:  That's correct. And the next thing you will
     do will be to set the mission timer and what
     we've done is to only turn on the mission timer
     on the MDC. And you'll probably have to wait here
     until they get through with the uplink so you can 
     have the computer.

[05:07:00:10]
CMP: Okay. Set it from the CMC, huh?

[05:07:00:13]
CC:  That's affirm. Okay. Now, we are getting
     ready to start the alinement sequence, and are
     you familiar with the general sequence of events
     we're going to use, Jack?

[05:07:00:29]
CMP: How do you mean? We are going to make an alinement on the Moon and on the Sun; other than that -
     I didn't get any - I wasn't on the headset when
     the general information was passed up, so if
     there was any more than that, I didn't get it.

[05:07:00:45]
_page : 648
_tape : Tape 85/11
CC: Okay. Basically, that is correct. Let me just
     run through it hand-waving-type for a minute,
     and then I'll read you the steps. I think it
     will make more sense. The scheme is that the
     [glossary:LM] can fly to a set of ball angles that will
     point your optics at the Moon. Now, at any time,
     in any attitude that we happen to be at, if
     you can look in the telescope and recognize star
     patterns sufficient that you believe you can
     make an alinement all on your own, that's the
     place we'd like to break off and let you go ahead
     and take over with your own alinement. However,
     we are giving you a procedure which will give you
     things we know you can see in the telescope without worrying about any reflections or anything
     of that nature, and it's not intended that this
     procedure has to be followed past the point where
     you know you've got good definition of star
     patterns in your telescope. If you need to go
     on, we'll maneuver, take a look at the Moon,
     we'll take a mark there, and then we'll maneuver
     with the [glossary:LM]/[glossary:FDAI] angles again and take a look at
     the Sun, and get yourself another mark on the
     Sun and that will complete the alinement. Now,
     the alinement scheme is that we are going to give
     you a set of angles that you can coarse aline the
     ball through when the [glossary:LM] is pointing you at the
     Moon. Now, this set of angles will agree with
     the [glossary:REFSMMAT] that you have in as a nominal
     [glossary:REFSMMAT] in you [glossary:CMC]. You can coarse aline to that,
     set a drift flag and REFSMMAT flag, and you'll
     have a good platform and we'll be within a
     couple of degrees of a good alinement. And, if
     we have to, we could break off at this point and
     go ahead with an entry; however, in an attempt
     to get a good platform, we are going to have you
     then do a [glossary:P52] option 1, and what you are going to
     find in the option 1 slots is the entry [glossary:REFSMMAT].
     You'll come up with the [glossary:NOUN 22] values, and we
     intend to go ahead and coarse aline the ball to
     the entry [glossary:REFSMMAT] attitude, and then we'll go
     ahead and take marks through a normal [glossary:P52]
     sequence. So that's the general scheme that
     we are going to use. If you think you have a
     handle on that, I will go ahead and read you
     the steps.

[05:07:03:11]
_page : 649
_tape : Tape 85/12
CMP: Okay. Well, let me ask a question. The [glossary:LM]
     maneuvers to a set of Moon-viewing angles. Okay,
     at this time, I am going to do a [glossary:P52], is that
     right? With the planet option?

[05:07:03:29]
CC:  The first thing we are going to do is to coarse
     aline the platform and get it inertial, based on
     the [glossary:REFSMMAT] that you have in the present slot
     inside the [glossary:CMC]. We'll then go - and do a [glossary:P52],
     option 4 - Correction, option 1.

[05:07:03:48]
CMP: Okay - That's after the [glossary:LM] gets established at
     the attitude. Jim says I'm here at the Moon-viewing attitude, I do a [glossary:VERB 41] [glossary:NOUN 20] to the
     set of angles that you're going to give me in
     the pad.

[05:07:04:00]
CC:  That's affirmative - -

[05:07:04:01]
CMP: And then I enter the [glossary:P52].

[05:07:04:03]
CC:  That's correct.

[05:07:04:04]
CMP: Okay. Then enter the [glossary:P52] and that's an
     option 3, right?

[05:07:04:11]
CC:  The [glossary:P52] will be done as an option 1. The only
     reason you have the other [glossary:REFSMMAT] inside the
     computer is that in order to set the [glossary:REFSMMAT]
     flag, you need some relative orientation.

[05:07:04:22]
CMP: Okay. I see. I do a [glossary:P52] option 1, and when do
     I set the [glossary:REFSMMAT] flag and the drift flag?

[05:07:04:33]
CC:  That will be before entering [glossary:P52]. I am going to
     give you this procedure in detail.

[05:07:04:38]
CMP: Okay. All right. Let's go at it. Maybe it'll
     all fall out and I won't have any questions.
     Go ahead.

[05:07:04:45]
CC:  Okay. I'm ready to start reading again. We
     start with a [glossary:VERB 41] [glossary:NOUN 20].

[05:07:05:08]
CMP: Okay. When the [glossary:LM] is in the Moon-viewing attitude,
     I do a [glossary:VERB 41] [glossary:NOUN 20], ENTER.

[05:07:05:14]
CC:  That's right. And you'll put in the attitudes
     that you'll get from one of the pads, and this
     will be for the coarse aline angles when the [glossary:LM]
     is at the Moon-viewing attitude. Then when
     they're all squared away, I tell you they have
     the right attitude; we then pick up again with
     a [glossary:VERB 40] [glossary:NOUN 20], ENTER.

[05:07:05:45]
_page : 650
_tape : Tape 85/13
CMP: Okay. [glossary:VERB 40] [glossary:NOUN 20], ENTER when Moon is -
     the [glossary:LM] is satisfied that they're at the Moon-viewing attitude.

[05:07:05:53]
CC:  That's correct. Now we're going to set the
     [glossary:REFSMMAT] and drift flags according to the G&C
     checklist, page G/7-1, steps 3 and 4.

[05:07:06:15]
CMP: Okay. Set the [glossary:REFSMMAT] flag for G&C 7-1,
     steps 3 and 4.

[05:07:06:20]
CC:  That's correct. Now [glossary:VERB 37], ENTER; 52, ENTER;
     option 1.

[05:07:06:33]
CMP: [glossary:VERB 37], ENTER; 52, ENTER; option 1.

[05:07:06:36]
CC:  That's correct. And we'll do the coarse aline.

[05:07:06:49]
CMP: Okay. Perform the coarse aline function.

[05:07:06:53]
CC:  Okay. Now when it gets back to the mark routines, we want to take a mark on the Moon.

[05:07:07:06]
CMP: Okay. Mark on the Moon with the crosshairs in
     the center. Is that right?

[05:07:07:10]
CC:  That's affirmative. Okay. When that's complete,
     the [glossary:LM] will maneuver to the Sun-viewing angle
     for attitude. And when they get there, you take
     a mark on the Sun using the Sun filter and the
     telescope; and, again, we're marking on the
     center.

[05:07:07:39]
CMP: Okay. Now, let me ask you a question. Is the
     first mark on the Moon made with the - are all
     these made with the telescope and not the
     sextant?

[05:07:07:49]
CC:  If - I'm not sure right offhand what the angular
     size of the Moon is, Jack. If you can get it in
     the sextant; that's the best thing to do, but
     you may have to go into the telescope in order
     to define the center. Either one's acceptable.

[05:07:08:04]
_page : 651
_tape : Tape 85/14
CMP: Okay. If I can define the center through the
     sextant, do it that way. And if I can't, use
     the telescope.

[05:07:08:10]
CC:  That's affirmed. We know you're going to use
     the telescope on the Sun.

[05:07:08:23]
CC:  Okay. You ready to press on?

[05:07:08:29]
CMP: I'm ready.

[05:07:08:30]
CC:  Okay. Just reminded we owe somebody a BAT B
     voltage.

[05:07:08:37]
CMP: Okay, another volts and amps coming up.

[05:07:08:40]
CC:  All right. Thank you. And this left us in [glossary:P52]
     with two marks, and we'll go ahead and torque
     the [glossary:NOUN 93]s.

[05:07:09:03]
CMP: Okay. ... torque the NOUN 93s, after the two
     marks.

[05:07:09:08]
CC:  Okay. So that gives us a good platform. Now
     the [glossary:LM] will maneuver to the jettison attitude,
     and the only thing of significance here is that
     you want to watch to make sure that the path
     they choose to go to the jettison attitude
     avoids gimbal lock on your own platform.

[05:07:09:38]
CMP: Okay. The [glossary:LM] maneuvers to the jettison attitude
     and I just monitor the maneuver and yell at Jim
     if he gets near a gimbal lock.

[05:07:09:46]
CC:  That's affirmed. Okay, and then the [glossary:LM] will go
     to a MAX deadband attitude hold in the jettison
     attitude.

[05:07:10:04]
CMP: Okay. The [glossary:LM] goes to MAX deadband attitude hold.

[05:07:10:09]
CC:  Okay. Now we're ready to go back to work. The
     next thing we'll do is to continue to powerup
     procedures. Do you have any further questions
     on that alinement, Jack?

[05:07:10:18]
CMP: No. No. I think - I think it's all self-explanatory now.

[05:07:10:23]
CC:  Okay. The one thing that everybody would like
     for you to understand is we certainly don't
     insist on using the Moon and the Earth; if you
     find you have good stars, why use them. However,
     this alinement is more than adequate to give us
     a good guided entry.

[05:07:10:40]
_page : 652
_tape : Tape 85/15
CMP: Okay. If I get a set of good stars, do I start
     right out to a basic [glossary:P51] and a [glossary:P52] option 1?

[05:07:10:50]
CC:  That's affirmative.

[05:07:10:53]
CMP: Okay.

[05:07:10:55]
CC:  Okay. Now, we're ready to go to work on
     panel 275. And it starts with a circuit breaker
     MAIN A - -

[05:07:11:01]
CMP: Wait - wait just a minute. Wait just a minute.
     I owe you some volts and amps.

[05:07:11:06]
CC:  Okay. All right.

[05:07:11:09]
CMP: Okay. Volts are 39.4, amps, 1.25.

[05:07:11:15]
CC:  Okay. I thought maybe, your meter was stuck
     before.

[05:07:11:20]
CMP: No (laughter).

[05:07:11:24]
CC:  All right. You ready to go back to 275? Have
     a circuit breaker MAIN A, BAT BUS A, closed.

[05:07:11:42]
CMP: CB MAIN A, BAT BUS A, closed.

[05:07:11:45]
CC:  That's correct. And circuit breaker MAIN B,
     BAT C, closed.

[05:07:11:57]
CMP: CB MAIN Baker, BAT Charlie, closed.

[05:07:12:00]
CC:  Okay. That's correct. Now we're up to [glossary:EI]
     minus 1 plus 30. And at this time, we're going
     to proceed with the closeout and hatch installation.

[05:07:12:30]
CMP: Okay. Closeout and hatch installation at [glossary:EI]
     minus 01:30.

[05:07:12:35]
CC:  That's right, Jack, and we're going to close the
     LM hatch, and we'll make the dump valve in the
     [glossary:LM] hatch closed.

[05:07:12:51]
_page : 653
_tape : Tape 85/16
CMP: Understand you're going to close the dump valve,
     now on the [glossary:LM] hatch, right?

[05:07:12:56]
CC:  That's correct.

[05:07:12:57]
CMP: Okay. This is a change from what we had understood previously.

[05:07:13:01]
CC:  That's correct.

[05:07:13:03]
CMP: I'm - Personally, I'm happy to see it, but that's
     good.

[05:07:13:06]
CC:  Okay. That's one vote on your side. Okay; and
     we're going to go ahead and do the - use the
     decal to perform the hatch installation, and
     we'll start on the hatch integrity check.

[05:07:13:39]
CMP: Okay. Per the decal, perform the hatch installation and start on the hatch integrity check.

[05:07:13:49]
CC:  That's correct.

[05:07:13:53]
CMP: Okay, Ken. One thing I think that - I don't
     know whether anybody - the decal don't take into
     account the fact that we still have the umbilicals connected. At what point in time should
     they be removed?

[05:07:14:10]
CC:  Okay, Jack. That doesn't matter. We're going
     to be separating the tunnel upstream of those
     umbilicals, and you can leave them right there.

[05:07:14:24]
CMP: Okay. Does it make any difference if we
     disengage - the [glossary:LM] - We have pulled the circuit
     breakers [glossary:LM] POWER-1 and -2, so if we choose to
     disconnect these umbilicals, there's no harm,
     right?

[05:07:14:41]
CC:  That's right. No sweat. John Aaron's just
     saying that they may be hot. He's checking on
     it, so how about holding a decision on that and
     let me come back to you?

[05:07:14:54]
CMP: Okay.

[05:07:14:59]
CC:  Okay. And let me tell you what we're going to
     do since we told you a different story this
     afternoon on this tunnel. We're actually going
     to vent the tunnel down so that we end up with
     about 1-1/2 to 2 psi absolute in the tunnel.
     And this will give us a DELTA-P of 3. So we'll
     do our hatch integrity check at the same time
     we're venting the tunnel down.

[05:07:15:24]
_page : 654
_tape : Tape 85/17
CMP: Okay. It sounds good.

[05:07:15:26]
CC:  Okay. Now let me give you some plumbing switches
     here. Let's take the SURGE TANK OXYGEN valve
     to ON.

[05:07:15:45]
CMP: SURGE TANK O<sub>2</sub> to ON.

[05:07:15:48]
CC:  All right. Take the MAIN REGs, two, OPEN.

[05:07:15:59]
CMP: MAIN REGs, two, to OPEN.

[05:07:16:02]
CC:  Okay. And the WATER AND GLYCOL TANK PRESSURE,
     the PRESSURE valve and the RELIEF valve to BOTH.

[05:07:16:20]
CMP: Okay, WATER AND GLYCOL TANKS PRESSURE and RELIEF
     valve to BOTH.

[05:07:16:26]
CC:  That's correct. And EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE
     valve to BOTH.

[05:07:16:40]
CMP: EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE to BOTH.

[05:07:16:43]
CC:  That's correct; and the SUIT DEMAND REGs to BOTH.

[05:07:16:55]
CMP: SUIT DEMAND REGs to BOTH.

[05:07:16:58]
CC:  That's correct. Okay, now we're going to
     panel 5: circuit breaker [glossary:ECS] TRANSDUCERs, PRESSURE GROUP 1 and 2, MAIN A and MAIN B. That's
     four circuit breakers, closed.

[05:07:17:26]
CMP: [glossary:ECS] TRANSDUCERs, GROUP 1 and 2, MAIN A and
     MAIN B, four, to close.

[05:07:17:32]
CC:  That's correct. Okay, now. Circuit breaker
     [glossary:ECS] TRANSDUCER, TEMPERATURE, MAIN A and MAIN B,
     that's two of them, closed.

[05:07:17:51]
CMP: CB [glossary:ECS] TRANSDUCER, TEMPERATURE, MAIN A and
     MAIN B, closed.

[05:07:17:57]
CC:  That's correct. On panel 4: PRIMARY [glossary:ECS]
     GLYCOL PUMPS, one, to AC 1.

[05:07:18:13]
CMP: Primary [glossary:ECS] GLYCOL PUMPS to 1, AC1.

[05:07:18:17]
_page : 655
_tape : Tape 85/18
CC:  That's correct. Okay, then we'll finish going
     back to the tunnel vent, and verify the [glossary:LM]/CM
     DELTA-P and make sure it's been holding pressure. And we'll come back again and rehash all
     of the hatch integrity check and tunnel vent
     procedures with you. The next thing I want to
     read off is the [glossary:EI] minus 1 plus 20. We'll go to
     panel 7: [glossary:BMAG] number 1 POWER to WARM UP.

[05:07:19:11]
CMP: [glossary:BMAG] number 1 POWER to WARM UP.

[05:07:19:15]
CC:  That's correct. Then at [glossary:EI] minus 1 plus 10, we'll
     perform [glossary:SCS] powerup per checklist, page G/2-4.

[05:07:19:35]
CMP: Okay. Perform [glossary:SCS] powerup per G&C checklist,
     page 2-4.

[05:07:19:42]
CC:  That's correct. Okay, on panel 4: SUIT COMPRESSOR NUMBER 2 to AC1.

[05:07:19:58]
CMP: SUIT COMPRESSOR 2 to IC1.

[05:07:20:01]
CC:  That's correct. SPACECRAFT CONTROL to [glossary:SCS].

[05:07:20:20]
CMP: SPACECRAFT CONTROL to [glossary:SCS].

[05:07:20:23]
CC:  Okay. And your MANUAL ATTITUDE switches, as you
     desire. We're coming up on jettison of the [glossary:LM],
     so that's just like separation.

[05:07:20:42]
CMP: Okay.

[05:07:20:44]
CC:  Okay. And we'll do a [glossary:GDC] aline.

[05:07:21:01]
CMP: Okay. Perform a [glossary:GDC] aline.

[05:07:21:03]
CC:  Okay. On panel 8: ROTATION CONTROL POWER,
     DIRECT, 1 and 2, MAIN A/MAIN B.

[05:07:21:29]
CMP: Okay. These are circuit breakers, ROTATION
     CONTROL POWER, DIRECT, 1 and 2, MAIN A and
     MAIN B, closed.

[05:07:21:42]
CC:  Okay, Jack. I was thinking switch. Let me
     verify that's a circuit breaker, too. I think
     we have to get both of them.

[05:07:21:52]
CMP: Okay, there's those four circuit breakers over
     there, Ken. When you said panel 8, that's what
     I thought you were talking about. I don't
     think the circuit breakers are out right now,
     but why don't we just put - verify the circuit
     breakers and put the switches to MAIN A/MAIN B.

[05:07:22:17]
_page : 656
_tape : Tape 85/19
CC: Okay, that's correct, Jack. Okay, at [glossary:EI] minus
     1 hour, we're going to be doing the [glossary:LM] jettison;
     so just prior to that, we want to do a [glossary:P47].

[05:07:22:47]
CMP: Okay, say at about 1 minute prior to [glossary:LM] jettison,
     huh?

[05:07:22:55]
CC:  Yes, just something that's comfortable for you.

[05:07:23:07]
CMP: Okay.

[05:07:23:08]
CC:  All right, after we've? done that, we want to get
     panel 8, SEQUENTIAL, PYRO ARM, two of them, ON.

[05:07:23:25]
CMP: Okay. I get a GO fron [glossary:MSFN] for this?

[05:07:23:32]
CC:  Okay, John says we can watch it.

[05:07:23:43]
CMP: Okay.

[05:07:23:44]
CC:  All right; the next thing is [glossary:CSM]/[glossary:LM] FINAL SEP,
     two of them, ON, up.

[05:07:23:59]
CMP: [glossary:CSM]/[glossary:LM] FINAL SEP, two, ON.

[05:07:24:02]
CC:  That's correct. Now we're going back to panel 8,
     and it's SEQUENTIAL, PYRO ARM, two of them, to
     SAFE.

[05:07:24:28]
CMP: Okay. SEQ PYRO ARM, two, to SAFE.

[05:07:24:31]
CC:  That's correct, and go back to [glossary:P00].

[05:07:24:42]
CMP: Okay. Go to [glossary:P00].

[05:07:24:44]
CC: All right. And now it's time to configure for
     single ring.

[05:07:25:00]
CMP: Okay. Configure for single ring [glossary:RCS].

[05:07:25:03]
CC:  That's right, and since you're still an hour
     from [glossary:EI], I guess it wouldn't hurt to use MINIMUM
     IMPULSE or something like that rather than the
     [glossary:DAP], at least not until you get closer down.
     We'll have the [glossary:DAP] loads for you later.

[05:07:25:25]
CMP: ... - -

[05:07:25:26]
_page : 657
_tape : Tape 85/20
CC:  Okay. And as soon as you've gotten yourself all
     set up with a good control mode, you want to
     maneuver to the entry attitude.

[05:07:25:45]
CMP: Maneuver to entry attitude per the pad.

[05:07:25:47]
CC:  That's correct. And we show [glossary:EI] minus 55, which
     really means when you get to the entry attitude,
     we have a sextant star check for you. And that
     will be on the pad.

[05:07:26:11]
CMP: Okay. Perform a sextant star check.

[05:07:26:14]
CC:  Okay. And I want to remind you to park the
     optics at 90 degrees of shaft.

[05:07:26:20]
CMP: Okay. Say again why, Ken. I didn't understand
     that.

[05:07:26:31]
CC:  Okay, this is just a precaution, Jack. If we
     park the optics with a 90-degree shaft angle,
     that will line up the slits so it gives you the
     best airflow over that part of the heat shield
     and avoids a hot spot. If you don't remember
     it, I don't think it makes much difference. It's
     just good procedure.

[05:07:26:52]
CMP: Okay.

[05:07:26:55]
CC:  Okay. And after you've got it parked wherever
     you want it, well, turn the OPTICS POWER OFF
     and stow the optics.

[05:07:27:14]
CMP: Okay. OPTICS POWER, OFF; stow the optics.

[05:07:27:17]
CC:  Okay, that's good, Okay. The next thing we'll
     do is to initialize the [glossary:EMS] and that's on entry
     checklist page 2-1, step number 2.

[05:07:27:40]
CMP: Okay, perform [glossary:EMS] initialization per entry
     checklist page 2-1, step 2.

[05:07:27:46]
CC:  Okay, that's correct. Now we're coming up on
     [glossary:EI] minus 45 minutes, and we'll give you an entry
     pad and a final state vector.

[05:07:28:12]
CMP: Okay, at minus 45, entry pad and final state
     vector from [glossary:MSFN].

[05:07:28:17]
CC:  Okay. Now we're going to perform what we call
     the Moon check. Rather than go into detail, if
     you already know what we're doing, just say so;
     otherwise, I'll describe the use of the 
     Moon-attitude set.

[05:07:28:38]
_page : 658
_tape : Tape 85/21
CMP: Maybe you better describe it.

[05:07:28:41]
CC:  Okay, Jack. You remember everybody in the past
     has commented on seeing Moonset just a couple
     minutes prior to [glossary:EI], and your horizon will 
     probably be dark at the time that you get there;
     you're having an early morning entry; and coming
     in from the west, you'll still be looking at a
     dark horizon. So, just as a backup technique,
     just like you would track the horizon, we're
     going to give you an attitude which will be on
     the pad so that you can look directly at the
     Moon. This is an inertial attitude; it won't
     be changing, and you'll put the 36-degree window
     line on the Moon, and then just sit there and
     watch it. And just prior to [glossary:EI], the Earth will
     come up and occult it, and you will then have a
     good horizon check. And I have some times, and
     I'll give you that later. And if you just look
     at this thing now, at that point you can set the
     [glossary:GDC] or whatever you desire. And you will have a
     known attitude reference. It's just like a
     horizon check.

[05:07:29:47]
CMP: Okay, I maneuver to the Moon check attitude; at
     which time I put the 36 window line on the Moon,
     and just prior to [glossary:EI], the Earth will occult the
     Moon.

[05:07:30:03]
CC:  That's correct. And that corresponds to the
     same inertial attitude that you'd have on the
     back of your entry card where it shows the 
     horizon attitude several minutes prior to [glossary:EI]; it's
     the same thing.

[05:07:30:21]
CMP: Yes, that's that one at 17 minutes prior. Okay.

[05:07:30:24]
CC:  Okay, and we're just getting it in a little
     closer. Okay, the next item on the check - checklist 
     here is an [glossary:EI] minus 40; we're going
     to panel 7, and it's [glossary:BMAG] NUMBER 2 POWER to
     WARM UP.

[05:07:30:49]
CMP: Okay, panel 7: [glossary:BMAG] NUMBER 2 POWER to WARM UP.

[05:07:30:52]
CC:  That's correct. Now, I'd like to verify the
     SURGE TANK and REPRESS PACKAGES are ON.

[05:07:31:13]
_page : 659
_tape : Tape 55/22
CMP: Verify SURGE TANK and REPRESS PACKAGE are ON.

[05:07:31:16]
CC: That's correct. On panel 5: circuit breaker
     ENVIRONMENTAL - CONTROL SYSTEM; WASTE WATER/URINE
     DUMP HEATER, two of them, closed.

[05:07:31:44]
CMP: Panel 5: CB [glossary:ECS], WASTE H<sub>2</sub>O/URINE DUMP HEATERS,
     two, to close.

[05:07:31:51]
CC:  That's correct. SUIT COMPRESSOR number 2 to OFF.

[05:07:32:07]
CMP: SUIT COMPRESSOR 2 to OFF.

[05:07:32:09]
CC:  That's right, Jack, and what this - what we're
     planning to do in order to conserve power is
     we're going to run the suit compressor from an
     hour to this point at minus 40. And we'll be
     watching the PCO<sub>2</sub>; if that thing's working, we'll
     turn it off at the earliest time that we have a
     good cabin, and then we'll just leave it off.
     And in the event that the PCO<sub>2</sub> gage isn't working
     properly or something like that, well, we'll just
     go ahead and run it for this time frame.

[05:07:32:40]
CMP: Okay, that sounds good.

[05:07:32:43]
CC:  All right. Now we're at [glossary:EI] minus 30. SEQUENTIAL, 
     LOGIC, that's two of them, to ON, up.

[05:07:32:57]
CMP: [glossary:EI] minus 30; SEQ, LOGIC, two, ON.

[05:07:33:01]
CC:  Okay, in panel 7: the [glossary:BMAG] number 2 POWER to ON.

[05:07:33:13]
CMP: Okay, we - you only gave that 10 minutes for the
     warmup, huh?

[05:07:33:18]
CC:  That's okay.

[05:07:33:20]
CMP: Okay.

[05:07:33:22]
CC:  All right, and [glossary:FDAI] POWER to BOTH.

[05:07:33:33]
CMP: [glossary:FDAI] POWER to BOTH.

[05:07:33:36]
CC:  Okay. And we want to activate the primary
     evaporator.

[05:07:33:54]
CMP: Okay, activate the primary evaporator. All this
     time, Ken, what've we been getting our cooling?
     Right now, I think we have the radiators at PULL
     TO BYPASS.

[05:07:34:03]
_page : 660
_tape : Tape 85/23
CC:  That's correct. We started out that way, and we
     turned the glycol pumps on, and we're just circulating 
     it internally. And we're counting on
     the command module being a heat sink; it's pretty
     cold soaked, and it looks like this is good
     enough. You got some relatively low heat loads - -

[05:07:34:20]
CMP: Okay.

[05:07:34:21]
CC:  - - and we'll keep watching the temps, and if
     we need it, why we'll start the evaporator early.

[05:07:34:27]
CMP: Okay, that sounds good.

[05:07:34:29]
CC:  Do you believe it's cold up there?

[05:07:34:33]
CMP: Yes, and we used to call the command module the
     bedroom and it's now the refrigerator.

[05:07:34:38]
CC:  Okay, just don't call it the reefer. Okay. At
     about [glossary:EI] minus 19, we get back into the standard
     entry checklist on page 2-2, where it starts
     with [glossary:P61].

[05:07:35:04]
CMP: Okay, at [glossary:EI] minus 19, we get back into the entry
     checklist at page 2-2, where we start entering
     [glossary:P61].

[05:07:35:14]
CC:  Okay, Jack. Now that's the - those are the
     time-line notes I had for you. I hate to tell
     you this, but I also have a couple of corrections
     to make to the entry checklist. They aren't corrections, 
     they just are pieces of the entry
     checklist which will correspond to what I've
     written - already read to you. And I'm ready to
     go on that whenever you are. And Vance tells me
     you can get into the descent water for drinking
     now.

[05:07:35:42]
CMP: We can get into the descent water for drinking,
     huh?

[05:07:35:45]
CC:  Yes.

[05:07:35:47]
CMP: Sounds good.

[05:07:35:48]
CC:  Hey, go to it.

[05:07:35:54]
CMP: Jim would like to know whether the descent water
     will be good until [glossary:LM] jettison?

[05:07:36:19]
_page : 661
_tape : Tape 85/24
CC: Okay, Jack. Looks like we're going to go on
     the ascent tanks at [time:05:08:30:00|128:30]. And it looks like - -

[05:07:36:29]
CMP: Okay, understand. We are going - -

[05:07:36:30]
CC:  - - you have plenty of water. I'm sorry we cut
     each other out; say again.

[05:07:36:34]
CMP: Okay, yes. I was going to say, understand we're
     going to go on the ascent tanks at [time:05:08:30:00|128:30].

[05:07:36:40]
CC:  That's right; based on the current rate, that's
     what they predict and you can go ahead and drink
     the water. No sweat.

[05:07:36:48]
CMP: Okay, real fine. And I've got the entry checklist 
     out and I'm ready to copy; just give me the
     page.

[05:07:36:54]
CC:  Okay. Jack, you're starting to sound like an LMP.

[05:07:37:04]
CMP: I think I'm probably the only CMP that's ever
     witnessed an - a [glossary:LM] burn from inside the [glossary:LM] in - in space flight.

[05:07:37:14]
CC:  (Laughter) I hope it stays that way. Okay,
     Jack, we're starting on page 1-1.

[05:07:37:21]
CMP: Go ahead.

[05:07:37:23]
CC:  Okay, down in the middle of the page on line 9,
     we're just going to strike out the "Activate VHF
     for COMM checks," and line 10, "Verify the [glossary:DSE]."
     We're going to leave the [glossary:DSE] OFF, and that's to
     save power, as is the VHF activation.

[05:07:37:42]
CMP: Okay.

[05:07:37:45]
CC:  Okay, on page 1-2. At minus 2 hours, there's a
     title "Logic sequence" check; and we're deleting
     that entire sequence; that's included in what I
     read up to you.

[05:07:38:03]
CMP: Okay, delete the logic sequence check at
     minus 2 hours there.

[05:07:38:09]
CC:  That's correct. And delete lines 23, 24, and
     25. That means a maneuver to SUPERCIRC entry
     attitude. Everything below that is deleted.

[05:07:38:33]
_page : 662
_tape : Tape 85/25
CC:  Okay. Delete lines 23 through 28.

[05:07:38:38]
CC:  That's correct. You got ahead of me. All right,
     on line 29 on page 1-3, we're going to put in a
     time of minus 00:55. That's the time we gave
     you for the boresight check.

[05:07:38:55]
CMP: Okay - -

[05:07:38:56]
CC:  That's your sextant check, really.

[05:07:39:05]
CMP: Got that.

[05:07:39:06]
CC:  Okay, on the top of page 1-4; where it said
     "1 hour and 15 minutes" next to line 32, we're
     going to change that to "Minus 2 hours and
     30 minutes."

[05:07:39:22]
CMP: Okay, minus 02:30 opposite item 32.

[05:07:39:25]
CC:  Okay, down at the bottom of the [glossary:EMS] entry check
     right there where we are, the bottom line now
     reads, "[glossary:EMS] MODE to STANDBY." Well, just above
     that - like to remind you to put a remark, "Do
     not initialize the range to go." This is because
     you're going to come into the [glossary:EMS] entry check,
     you're going to run through all these things;
     then we're going to remove power from the [glossary:EMS].
     And just didn't want you to get ahead of yourself
     and initialize the entry parameters, because
     you'll lose them when we power up.

[05:07:39:59]
CMP: Okay.

[05:07:40:00]
CC:  And, after we go [glossary:EMS] MODE to STANDBY, like for
     you to add "Circuit breaker [glossary:EMS], two, to open."

[05:07:40:19]
CMP: Okay, "CB [glossary:EMS], two, to open."

[05:07:40:21]
CC:  That's correct. And we want to delete this "Set
     up camera" that's listed on the bottom of the
     page. We're deleting that for power reasons.
     That's line 33 Alfa.

[05:07:40:34]
CMP: Okay, we're way ahead of you. We already got it
     stowed.

[05:07:40:39]
CC:  Okay. On the top of the next page where it says
     "Secondary water EVAP," just keep in mind we
     don't plan to use the secondary evaporators unless 
     the primary fails. On line 35 on page 1-5,
     next to "Command module [glossary:RCS] preheat," the time
     is now "Minus 06:30."

[05:07:41:14]
_page : 663
_tape : Tape 85/26
CMP: Okay, "minus 06:30," and the voltage reading 3.9
     still is good, right?

[05:07:41:21]
CC:  Okay, very good. Under "Final stowage," the
     first thing that's listed on line 36, page 1-5,
     is "Optics." And if you want to get started on
     your stowage, we'd like to leave the optics out,
     because we'll have the star check coming up quite
     a bit after this. The rest of that stuff can be
     taken care of at your convenience.

[05:07:41:47]
CMP: Okay.

[05:07:41:48]
CC:  All right, still on pace 1-5, line 37; the time
     is now "Minus 06:10."

[05:07:42:03]
CMP: Got that.

[05:07:42:05]
CC:  Okay, and this is one time it looks like we
     might actually do the preheat, so that's the
     reason we want to make sure that we know that
     not more than 20 minutes of time on the preheat.
     We may not be able to watch it at that time
     because you aren't powered up.

[05:07:42:34]
CMP: Okay. Either 20 minutes or until 3.9 volts DC.

[05:07:42:38]
CC:  That's correct, Jack. And now let's go to
     page 1-6. And about one-third of the way down,
     it shows "Panel 275 CB MAIN A, BAT C, closed,"
     we want to strike off that line, the next two
     lines, and we're going to strike out "MAIN A,
     BAT C, closed; MAIN B, BAT C, closed; and DC
     INDICATOR, MAIN B."

[05:07:43:11]
CMP: Okay. After that step on panel 275, strike out
     "CB MAIN A, BAT C; CB MAIN B, BAT C; and DC
     INDICATORS to MAIN B."

[05:07:43:22]
CC:  That's correct. Now reader panel 8, it tells you
     to "Close all circuit breakers EXCEPT," and I
     have four additions. The first one is CB SERVICE
     MODULE [glossary:RCS] HEATERS, QUAD Charlie, MAIN B, open.

[05:07:43:50]
CMP: SERVICE MODULE [glossary:RCS] HEATERS, QUAD Charlie, MAIN
     Baker, open.

[05:07:43:55]
_page : 664
_tape : Tape 85/27
CC: Okay. And the same thing for SERVICE MODULE [glossary:RCS]
     HEADERS, QUAD Delta, MAIN A, open.

[05:07:44:11]
CMP: SERVICE MODULE [glossary:RCS] HEATERS, QUAD Delta, MAIN A,
     open.

[05:07:44:15]
CC:  That's correct. And Circuit breaker [glossary:EMS], that's
     two of them, open.

[05:07:44:34]
CMP: CB [glossary:EMS], two, to open.

[05:07:44:36]
CC:  All right. And the last is the circuit breakers
     for [glossary:SPS] GAGING, four of them, open.

[05:07:44:54]
CMP: [glossary:SPS] GAGING, four to open.

[05:07:44:58]
CC:  Okay. And how about our readout on the battery
     and that charger?

[05:07:45:05]
CMP: Okay, BAT's at volts and amps.

[05:07:45:09]
CC:  That's affirmed. And let's go back to page 1-6,
     line 41. Let's put in a time "Minus 04:40."

[05:07:45:20]
CMP: Minus 04:40.

[05:07:45:22]
CC:  That's correct. On page 2-1, line number 2, put
     in a time of "Minus 55 minutes."

[05:07:45:44]
CMP: Okay, minus 55 minutes.

[05:07:45:47]
CC:  Okay. And the first thing you want to do under
     "[glossary:EMS] initialization," is circuit breakers [glossary:EMS],
     that's two of them, to close.

[05:07:46:01]
CMP: Okay. CB [glossary:EMS], two, to close.

[05:07:46:04]
CC:  That's correct. All right. Line 4 or step 4,
     where it shows "[glossary:CM] [glossary:RCS] check." That occurs at
     minus 04:30.

[05:07:46:17]
CMP: Okay. Minus 04:30.

[05:07:46:20]
CC:  All right. Under "[glossary:CM] [glossary:RCS] checks," the fourth
     line down says "MANUAL ATTITUDE, three, to MINIMUM 
     IMPULSE." We'll have to use "ACCEL COMMAND"
     and the reason for that, Jack, is we don't have
     the [glossary:SPS] powered up so there's no minimum impulse
     generator.

[05:07:46:39]
_page : 665
_tape : Tape 85/28
CMP: Okay. MANUAL ATTITUDE, three, to ACCEL COMMAND.

[05:07:46:42]
CC:  That's correct. And on the same page 2-1, strike
     out the last three lines, starting with "RCS
     transfer to service module."

[05:07:46:57]
CMP: Right. The last three lines are scratched out.
     We ain't got one of those things.

[05:07:47:02]
CC:  That's correct. Okay, let's flip to page 2-2
     and strike out the first two lines.

[05:07:47:11]
CMP: Okay. Now wait a second. I need to give you
     volts and amps, Ken.

[05:07:47:14]
CC: All right. Go ahead.

[05:07:47:19]
CMP: Okay. It's 39.6, 1.12.

[05:07:47:25]
CC:  Sounds like you're getting there. Okay. I
     believe we scratched out the first two lines on
     2-2. Now, we're - right below that, it says
     "Separation checklist." So we're going to just
     delete that whole thing; it's included in the
     notes I gave you.

[05:07:47:50]
CMP: Okay. It's included in the notations.

[05:07:47:55]
CC:  All right. Line number 7. It says "Maneuver to
     horizon check attitude." We're going to call
     this the "Moon-check attitude" and this is the
     one we discussed, Jack. The angle of 265 is not
     correct. I'll have one of those for you first
     thing in the morning.

[05:07:48:15]
CMP: Okay.

[05:07:48:16]
CC:  Okay. And at the bottom of the page, step
     number 1. That will be at [glossary:EI] minus 19 minutes,
     and we're off and running through a normal
     sequence of events.

[05:07:48:32]
CMP: Okay. That sounds good. Ken, I guess if you've
     read this thing - Is it a comfortable time line?
     Any areas where you had problems with?

[05:07:48:42]
CC:  Jack, it is very comfortable. We've run it
     several times now and, in fact, it's being run
     right now, again. And we've run it both here
     at Houston and at the Cape. The only place where
     you might find that you need to stay ahead of
     things is during the platform-alinement period,
     when you're getting ready to close out the [glossary:LM]
     and then once you get into the command module and
     jettison the [glossary:LM], why you're back on a very comfortable time. And, of course, we'll be watching
     and anything we can do, like keeping track of
     time for you, we'll remind you of that as we go
     along.

[05:07:49:16]
_page : 666
_tape : Tape 85/29
CMP: Hey, that would be good - that would be good,
     Ken.

[05:07:49:22]
CC:  Okay. Let me emphasize, Jack, that 2-1/2 hours
     is the earliest time we can start in on that
     powerup stuff. Everything else you can do the
     way you normally would, where you get as far
     ahead of the game as you can. But the 2-1/2-hour time is based on saving command module consumables. And if you do that, why we're fat;
     we've got plenty of time to give you some fans
     on the water even. So that's the one point you
     don't want to start early on. I do have a
     couple of more lines to run through on the entry
     checklist and two pages in the G&C. And I think
     that will clean us up.

[05:07:50:14]
CMP: Okay, Ken. And G&C checklist now?

[05:07:50:17]
CC:  Let me finish a couple more things in the entry
     book. You still got that?

[05:07:50:23]
CMP: Yes. Go ahead.

[05:07:50:24]
CC:  Okay. On - These are just cleanup items, Jack.
     On page 2-3, it lists how you separate, from the
     CM/[glossary:SM] SEP and all that, so, obviously, if we're
     on step 5 at 43 minutes down - that's all deleted.
     And that gets deleted all the way over onto
     page 2-4, up to the line where it says "15 minutes." And at that point, we pick back up and
     everything. From 15 minutes down is valid.

[05:07:51:07]
CMP: Okay. Delete item 5 down to the point where it
     says "Minus 15 minutes."

[05:07:51:14]
CC:  That's correct, Jack. Okay, on page 2-5. The
     top line where we had "Horizon check," that's
     now the "Moonset check" and the time is approximately 57:37. And that's minus 02:23. And that
     angle that's listed in the book there - 177 -
     that's really a horizon time at 2 minutes; we'll
     have you - can look that up on the back of your
     entry cue card, and I'll look that number up
     again for you tonight.

[05:07:52:00]
_page : 667
_tape : Tape 85/30
CMP: Okay.

[05:07:52:01]
CC:  Okay. Another thing is to remember when we begin
     blackout, which is around 05g, and you can write
     this in your checklist wherever it's convenient;
     once we've lost COMM, we're going to go ahead and
     power down the [glossary:SCE] POWER OFF and the PMP POWER
     OFF. And we just want to do that after you lose
     COMM, which comes up around [glossary:EI]. Any time after
     that, go ahead and secure the PMP and the [glossary:SCE]
     power.

[05:07:52:42]
CMP: Okay. When COMM is lost, [glossary:SCE] POWER OFF, PMP
     POWER OFF.

[05:07:52:47]
CC:  That's correct, Jack, and that completes the
     entry checklist. Let's look at the G&C book.

[05:07:53:06]
CMP: Okay. Ready to copy.

[05:07:53:08]
CC:  Okay. Let's go to page 2-1.

[05:07:53:25]
CMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[05:07:53:27]
CC:  Okay, Jack. The second line under "[glossary:IMU] powerup"
     says "[glossary:FDAI] POWER to BOTH," and we're going to
     make that a "1." The reason we're doing that
     is, again, to conserve power. There's no reason
     to drive the second [glossary:FDAI] before we get that
     information to put on it.

[05:07:53:48]
CMP: Okay. "[glossary:FDAI] POWER to 1."

[05:07:53:53]
CC:  All right. That's correct. On page 2-2.

[05:07:54:06]
CMP: Go ahead.

[05:07:54:07]
CC:  Okay. Under [glossary:CMC] powerup, line - or step 2 says
     "Flashing 3700, ENTER." The time we're going to
     use this, Jack, is going to be when you've just
     brought the computer up and it has a state vector
     in it that's way back many, many hours ago. So
     we want to do a [glossary:VERB 96], ENTER to stop the integration to keep it from just sitting there
     ambling along. And when the ground gives you a
     new state vector, why then we can go through [glossary:P00]
     and we'll be back in business.

[05:07:54:43]
_page : 668
_tape : Tape 85/31
CMP: Okay. You want me to go to [glossary:VERB 37], ENTER; 00,
     ENTER; and then do a [glossary:VERB 96]?

[05:07:54:55]
CC: When you come up, I guess you're going to - once
     you get the [glossary:CMC] powered up, you're probably going
     to be going - you're going to come up in a flashing 37, and if you'll just do a VERB 96, ENTER
     right there, that will take care of it.

[05:07:55:08]
CMP: Okay.

[05:07:55:09]
CC:  All right. And the last one I have for you is
     on page 2-4.

[05:07:55:23]
CMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[05:07:55:24]
CC:  Okay. Under the [glossary:SCS] powerup, the first line
     says "AUTO [glossary:RCS] SELECT, 16, to OFF." Okay. You
     can just delete that part. On the fifth line,
     it says "Circuit breaker [glossary:SCS] LOGIC POWER," that's
     really "LOGIC BUS, four of them, to closed."
     The DELTA-V CG is not important since we are not
     burning the engine. The "SIGNAL CONDITIONER/DRIVER
     BIAS POWER" lists "Two to AC 1." We are
     going to make that just one of them; make it
     "SIGNAL CONDITION/DRIVER BIAS POWER, one, to
     AC 1." The "[glossary:BMAG] POWER," which is the third
     line from the bottom, says "[glossary:BMAG] POWER, two, ON;"
     we are going to make that just one. We'll bring
     up number 1, and we'll make "[glossary:FDAI] POWER, number 1" and the last line "AUTO [glossary:RCS] SELECT, 16,
     enable," you can strike that off and replace it
     with "[glossary:BMAG] MODE, three of them, to RATE 1." You
     want to try reading that back?

[05:07:56:58]
CMP: Okay. Delete "AUTO [glossary:RCS] SELECT, 16, OFF." Change
     "CB LOGIC POWER" to "LOGIC THRUST POWER - CBS
     CS LOGIC THRUST, four, to closed." Delete
     "DELTA-V CG," coming down here "SIGNAL
     CONDITIONER/DRIVER BIAS POWER, one, AC 1; [glossary:BMAG]
     POWER, 1, to ON," and it's the number 1 [glossary:BMAG].
     "[glossary:FDAI] POWER to 1; [glossary:BMAG] MODE, three, to RATE 1,"
     deleting the "AUTO [glossary:RCS] SELECT, 16, to enable."

[05:07:57:34]
CC:  That's correct. You've got them all, Jack.
     Very good. Thank you.

[05:07:57:40]
CMP: Thank you. This does it, huh?

[05:07:57:43]
_page : 669
_tape : Tape 85/32
CC: Yes, sir. Let's see - just a second - let me
     check on this hatch and integrity check maybe
     I can tell you something about that. And I do
     have an answer to your [glossary:LM] power question about
     the umbilicals. The umbilicals will be unpowered
     according to the [glossary:LM] procedures, so if you'd like
     to disconnect them, you can.

[05:07:58:04]
CMP: Okay. I think we will.

[05:07:58:06]
CC:  All right, sir. Okay, Jack, and they'd like us
     to stand by just a second.

[05:07:58:19]
CC:  Jack, would you get the BATTERY CHARGER, OFF,
     please. And we'll send you - -

[05:07:58:24]
CMP: Okay.

[05:07:58:25]
CC:  - - the rest of that procedure later.

[05:07:58:26]
CMP: You mean there's more? Okay, in work. BATTERY
     CHARGER is going OFF.

[05:07:58:33]
CC:  Right.

[05:07:58:34]
CMP: Okay, Vance. Okay - I don't think you've given
     me the backout procedure, have you, for the
     battery chargers?

[05:07:58:43]
CC:  That's negative. Wait. All we want to do, Jack,
     is say BATTERY CHARGE OFF at the moment. We'll
     complete that procedure as soon as you are
     through with Ken completely.

[05:07:59:01]
CMP: Okay, Vance. The BATTERY CHARGER's OFF, and
     I'm ready to continue with Ken.

[05:07:59:06]
CC:  Okay, Jack. And we'll get the backout to you
     after that.

[05:07:59:13]
CC:  Okay, Jack. It looks like we've closed up the
     loose ends here. Amazingly enough, out of all
     that stuff, it looks like we only generated one
     question on the floor, and we'll research that
     one. We'll even let you guess what it might
     have been. If you have any questions, after you
     mull it over, why, we're always available. Just
     ask us what you're thinking about.

[05:08:00:40]
CMP: Okay. That's what we're going to do. We're
     going to wait until the [glossary:LM] people get theirs,
     and then we're going to discuss it and coordinate
     things here, and make sure that - that we don't
     have any interface problems. And, if we have any
     more questions, we'll be coming back at you.

[05:08:00:55]
_page : 670
_tape : Tape 85/33
CC:  Okay. We did run the thing integrated, so we
     think we've got all the little surprises ironed
     out for you.

[05:08:01:04]
CMP: I hope so because tomorrow is examination time.

[05:08:01:08]
CC:  Roger.

[05:08:01:09]
CDR: Ken, this is Jim.

[05:08:01:11]
CC:  Yes, sir.

[05:08:01:12]
CDR: Appreciate the work you've done, and Jack says
     that it's going to be hard to beat his record
     about saving [glossary:SM] [glossary:RCS] fuel all the way there and
     back.

[05:08:01:22]
CC:  I can't do much about that.

[05:08:01:25]
CC:  Some people will do anything to set a record.

[05:08:01:32]
_extra : END OF TAPE/nAPOLLO 13 AIR-TO-GROUND TRANSCRIPTION
CC:  Hey, Jim, you even did good on service module
     fuel this time.

[05:08:01:40]
_page : 671
_tape : Tape 86/1
CMP: Yes. We're coming back with a full load almost
     of both [glossary:RCS] and [glossary:SPS], that's - That's pretty much of a record.

[05:08:01:56]
CMP: Okay. Did you want to put Fred-o on, or somebody to copy the [glossary:LM] - the [glossary:LM] side of the house.

[05:08:02:08]
CC:  Hey, Jack. Don't wake him up yet. Stand by 1.

[05:08:02:13]
CMP: He's - He's awake.

[05:08:02:30]
CC: Hey, Jack. We'll give you this battery charging
     backout procedure, and then Deke says you ought
     to get some sleep. You're going to need it
     tomorrow.

[05:08:02:44]
CMP: Okay. I'm ready to copy the backout procedure.

[05:08:02:47]
CC:  Okay. Panel 3: BATTERY CHARGE, OFF - you've
     already done that, Jack - next AC INVERTER,
     INVERTER 2 OFF: Panel 5: MAIN BUS TIE BAT B/C
     to BAT B/C. Huh? Yes, it's up - the up position.
     Panel 250: circuit breaker, BAT A POWER ENTRY/
     POSTLANDING to open; circuit breaker, BAT B POWER
     ENTRY/POSTLANDING, open, Panel 5: CB BATTERY
     CHARGER BAT B CHARGE, open. Okay. I'll let you
     read that back, Jack.

[05:08:04:09]
CMP: Okay. BAT CHARGE, OFF; AC INVERTER 2 to OFF;
     MAIN BUS TIE, BAT B/C to on, up. Panel 250:
     BAT A, POWER ENTRY AND POSTLANDING, open; CB,
     BAT B, POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, open. Panel 5:
     CB BAT CHARGER, BAT B CHARGED, open.

[05:08:04:32]
CC:  Okay. That's correct. Now, that gets you back to
     the place where you can back out of the - the big
     battery charging procedure, which you have. And
     I - I think you have the backout procedure for
     that, but I'd like to check with you.

[05:08:05:00]
CMP: Okay. Stand by here.

[05:08:05:12]
CC:  Okay, Jack. Do you have that backout procedure in
     your hand there?

[05:08:05:20]
CMP: Yes, I do, Vance.

[05:08:05:22]
CC:  Okay. Just to verify. It starts out panel 3,
     BATTERY CHARGE switch, OFF; AC INVERTER 2, OFF;
     panel 5, MAIN BUS TIE, BAT A/C, on, up, et cetera.

[05:08:05:40]
_page : 672
_tape : Tape 86/2
CMP: Roger. Continues CB BAT A, POWER ENTRY/
     POSTLANDING, open; INVERTER POWER 2, MAIN B,
     open; and then you reverse the steps that you
     had for entering the procedure.

[05:08:05:54]
CC:  Yes, that's fine. Okay. And we have one other
     comment regarding the systems checklist, and
     stand by 1, and that'll - that'll wrap it up for
     us. Oh, a new item came in, Jack. We need to
     switch to ascent water, and I have a three-step
     procedure for you, if you're ready to copy.

[05:08:06:27]
CMP: Okay. Jim will copy that.

[05:08:06:32]
CC:  Okay. DESCENT WATER valve, CLOSE. ASCENT WATER
     valve to CLOSE, and WATER TANK SELECT valve to
     ASCENT.

[05:08:07:24]
CDR: Okay, Vance. DESCENT WATER valve, closed; ASCENT
     WATER valve, closed; and WATER SELECT TANK to
     ASCENT. Is that correct?

[05:08:07:34]
CC: WATER TANK SELECT valve, ASCENT. That's correct,
     Jim.

[05:08:07:45]
CDR: And we'll proceed with that right now, and how
     about still drinking descent water?

[05:08:08:12]
CC:  Jim, we understand that you should be able to
     continue drinking, it.

[05:08:08:24]
CDR: Okay. We switched to ascent water, but we'll
     probably have to have the descent water valve
     back open up again to drink water.

[05:08:08:34]
CC:  That's affirm. That's the one thing you'll have
     to do is, whenever you want to drink out of the
     descent tank, is open the descent valve - the
     DESCENT WATER valve momentarily.

[05:08:08:49]
CDR: Okay. And we are now on ascent water.

[05:08:08:53]
CC:  Okay; okay. And I need Jack back again, please.

[05:08:09:02]
CMP: Okay, Vance. I'm here, and you have something in
     the systems checklist.

[05:08:09:06]
CC:  That's right. Refer to S/2-6. This - Really
     what we're talking about, Jack, is the hatch
     integrity check decal. And I think it'll be
     easiest, if you'll open to S/2-6 and I explain
     it to you.

[05:08:09:41]
_page : 673
_tape : Tape 86/3
CMP: Okay, Vance. I'm ready to copy.

[05:08:09:44]
CC:  Okay. This will - This just involves changes.
     Look down to the third line where it says "TUNNEL
     VENT valve, TUNNEL VENT for 30 seconds;" cross
     out "30 seconds" and cross out the two lines
     below that. In other words, "[glossary:LM] [glossary:CSM] DELTA-P.
     Check DELTA-P and recycle to TUNNEL VENT."

[05:08:10:24]
CMP: Okay. You want me to delete "For 30 seconds."

[05:08:10:34]
CC:  That's affirm. And the two lines below "30 seconds." And actually the part of the fourth line
     there, which is "8-1/2 minutes."

[05:08:10:50]
CMP: Stand by. Can you read okay?

[05:08:10:53]
CC:  Yes. I hear you now.

[05:08:10:55]
CMP: Okay. Delete the two lines below that, or the
     two-and-a-half lines below that, also.

[05:08:11:02]
CC:  That's affirm. And now, we have an addition to
     put in place of what we deleted. Stand by 1; the
     COMM's bad. How do you read?

[05:08:11:14]
CMP: Roger. Loud and clear.

[05:08:11:16]
CC:  Okay. We want you to vent - tunnel vent until,
     and add the following, "Until [glossary:LM]/[glossary:CM] DELTA-P is
     equal to 3.0 psid."

[05:08:11:42]
CMP: Okay. "Until [glossary:LM]/[glossary:CM] DELTA-P equals 3.0."

[05:08:11:47]
CC:  Okay. And that means that you'll have a pressure
     of 1.5 to 2 in the tunnel, absolute. That's - -

[05:08:11:57]
CMP: Okay.

[05:08:11:58]
CC:  That's a note.

[05:08:12:01]
F:   Jack, that's what we want to end up with ultimately
     is 1-1/2 to 2 there in that tunnel and depending
     on the gage reading, but that should be about 3.

[05:08:12:10]
CMP: Okay, Deke.

[05:08:12:12]
CC:  Okay, then, Jack. Continuing on, everything's
     okay until you get down to - on the next page,
     you get through "Verify O<sub>2</sub> FLOW INDICATOR no increase." We would like to delete everything below
     that, until the last step, which is TUNNEL LIGHTS,
     OFF. So starting with "Before undocking only,"
     delete all lines through "TUNNEL VENT VALVE to
     TUNNEL VENT."

[05:08:12:50]
_page : 674
_tape : Tape 86/4
CMP: Okay. Delete the section that says "Before un-docking
     only" down to where it says "TUNNEL VENT
     VALVE to TUNNEL VENT."

[05:08:12:57]
CC:  Yes, through that.

[05:08:13:00]
CMP: Well, through that. Leave "TUNNEL LIGHTS OFF" is
     the only step remaining.

[05:08:13:04]
CC:  Roger. And just - That's a verify.

[05:08:13:14]
CMP: Okay. Got that.

[05:08:13:15]
CC:  Okay. Really what this does for you, then, is
     it gives you a pressure - a tunnel pressure
     integrity - or a hatch pressure integary - integrity check with a DELTA-P of 3 psi between the
     tunnel and the cabin. And then you never go on
     to the steps of venting that on out. You just
     leave it in there for the time that you separate
     from the [glossary:LM]. And that gives you a shotgun
     DELTA-V effect.

[05:08:13:52]
CMP: Okay. Copy that.

[05:08:13:54]
CC:  Okay. I think that's all, but we're polling the
     house here to see if there's another comment for
     you. Stand by.

[05:08:15:19]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:08:15:23]
CMP: Go ahead, Vance.

[05:08:15:24]
CC:  Jack, that's it. Unless you have any more questions, why, everyone is hoping you'll hit the sack
     and get some rest.

[05:08:15:34]
CMP: Okay. You want that battery backout procedure
     now to take that - to complete the remaining
     steps?

[05:08:15:50]
CC:  That's affirm, Jack. We request that you go
     ahead and finish out the backout completely until
     you get to square 1. Over.

[05:08:16:04]
CMP: Okay.

[05:08:16:24]
_page : 675
_tape : Tape 86/5
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[05:08:16:26]
CC:  Go ahead, Jim.

[05:08:16:29]
CDR: Do you have any more updates for us?

[05:08:16:32]
CC:  We've still got a [glossary:LM] update, but we strongly
     recommend that you and Jack work as hard as you
     can sleeping for about the next 5 hours. Fred
     can handle it.

[05:08:16:42]
CDR: Okay. That's what we'll do. We'll put Fred on
     watch here, and Jack and I will take it easy, and
     if Fred copies the [glossary:LM] update, well, then we'll all
     start from fresh in the morning.

[05:08:16:56]
CC:  You bet.

[05:08:23:44]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[05:08:23:48]
LMP: All right, go ahead, Vance.

[05:08:23:50]
CC:  Okay, Fred. Two - three things. First thing is
     we need a docking angle check as soon as you can
     conveniently get it. Second point, you're free
     to drink all the descent stage water you want,
     if that wasn't clear before. And the third point,
     if you have a piece of paper, stand by to get
     writer's cramps. We have something to give you
     here.

[05:08:24:21]
LMP: Okay. You want the - again a look at the docking
     tunnel index?

[05:08:24:27]
CC:  Why don't you go ahead and look at that - -

[05:08:24:28]
LMP: ... - -

[05:08:24:31]
CC:  Look at that first, yes.

[05:08:24:34]
LMP: Okay.

[05:08:25:46]
LMP: Okay. Jim says the docking tunnel index is a
     plus 2.1 degrees.

[05:08:25:52]
CC:  Okay. Plus 2.1 degrees, docking tunnel index.

[05:08:25:58]
LMP: Okay. He corrects himself. He says make that
     sign a minus. Minus 2.1 degrees.

[05:08:26:04]
CC:  Okay. We just changed, plus to minus.

[05:08:26:09]
_page : 676
_tape : Tape 86/6
LMP: Okay. And your second item was, we can drink all
     of that descent waster that's left - looks like
     about 5 percent, and I'll get a book here and be
     ready to start writing.

[05:08:26:23]
CC:  Okay. Get - This won't be as long as - as the one
     T. K. read up, but you'll need several pages,
     probably.

[05:08:26:35]
LMP: Okay. I've got lots of pages here of Ken's photo
     log set to go.

[05:08:26:41]
CC:  Okay, Fred-o. Okay. This is "Entry, [glossary:LM] PREP."
     Starts [glossary:EI] minus 6 hours. At that time, you power
     up the ACS. I think I'll give you a line at a
     time and, when I hear you say okay on that, I'll
     go to the next. That sound reasonable?

[05:08:27:11]
LMP: Okay. I'll go hot mike briefly.

[05:08:27:16]
CC:  Okay. BAT 5 -

[05:08:27:25]
LMP: Hey, how do you read now?

[05:08:27:27]
CC:  Okay. I read you okay, Fred. Okay. Battery 5 - -

[05:08:27:33]
LMP: Okay ...

[05:08:27:37]
CC:  Battery 5 NORMAL FEED ON is the first step.

[05:08:27:50]
LMP: Okay, Vance. That - Go ahead.

[05:08:27:53]
CC:  Okay. Use modified [glossary:LM] [glossary:DPS]/[glossary:RCS] 30-minute activation
     checklist.

[05:08:28:22]
LMP: Okay.

[05:08:28:25]
CC:  [glossary:EI] minus 5 hours. Midcourse-7, if required.
     Next: [glossary:LM] preentry procedure. And, Fred, the
     time on [glossary:LM] preentry procedure is just - -

[05:08:28:49]
LMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[05:08:28:50]
CC:  Okay. The time on the [glossary:LM] preentry procedure is
     just as soon as you finish midcourse-7, or
     5 hours -

[05:08:29:08]
LMP: All right, go ahead, Vance.

[05:08:29:09]
CC:  Okay.

[05:08:29:10]
_page : 677
_tape : Tape 86/7
LMP: Okay. I've got this [glossary:TEI] minus 5 hours, [glossary:MCC]-7 if
     required, and now you're going to start me a new
     procedure called [glossary:LM] preentry procedure. Go ahead.

[05:08:29:19]
CC:  Roger. Maneuver to [glossary:SM] SEP attitude. Configure
     for [glossary:CSM] hotfire.

[05:08:29:44]
LMP: Okay.

[05:08:29:46]
CC:  Under that, DEADBAND, MAX; and ATTITUDE CONTROL,
     three, to PULSE.

[05:08:30:04]
LMP: Okay.

[05:08:30:05]

LMP: Okay.

[05:08:30:25]
CC:  And under that, ATTITUDE CONTROL, PITCH and ROLL,
     PULSE; YAW, MODE CONTROL.

[05:08:30:51]
CC:  Okay. Next, [glossary:EI] minus 4 hours, 30 minutes. Configure for CM/[glossary:SM] SEP.

[05:08:31:02]
LMP: Okay. Hold on a minute.

[05:08:31:03]
CC:  Okay.

[05:08:31:04]
LMP: That was [glossary:EI] - [glossary:EI] minus 4-1/2?

[05:08:31:07]
CC:  That's correct.

[05:08:31:26]
LMP: Okay. That's [glossary:EI] minus 4-1/2 hours, configure
     for [glossary:SM] SEP.

[05:08:31:30]
CC:  That's affirm, and under that, BALANCE COUPLE, ON.

[05:08:31:42]
LMP: Okay.

[05:08:31:44]
CC:  [glossary:AGS] 404, plus 0; 405, plus 0; 406, plus 0; and
     470, read out.

[05:08:32:11]
LMP: Okay. Got it.

[05:08:32:14]
CC:  Translate plus-X at 0.5 feet per second.

[05:08:32:30]
LMP: Okay.

[05:08:32:32]
CC:  Then CM/[glossary:SM] SEP. After SEP, null 470 - -

[05:08:32:42]
_page : 678
_tape : Tape 86/8
LMP: Okay. stand by 1.

[05:08:32:43]
CC:  Okay.

[05:08:33:00]
LMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[05:08:33:02]
CC:  After SEP, null 470 to 0.

[05:08:33:25]
LMP: Okay.

[05:08:33:27]
CC:  ATTITUDE CONTROL, three of them, to PULSE.

[05:08:33:43]
LMP: Okay.

[05:08:33:44]
CC:  Pitch to acquire service module for photos.

[05:08:34:07]
LMP: Okay.

[05:08:34:09]
CC:  Okay. Note: use ACA for control.

[05:08:34:30]
LMP: Okay. We can use the ACA now for control.

[05:08:34:37]
CC:  Roger. [glossary:EI] minus 3 hours, maneuver and ATT HOLD
     for Moon view, attitude - -

[05:08:34:59]
LMP: Wait a minute. Was that maneuver in ATT HOLD for
     Moon view. Is that right?

[05:08:35:04]
CC:  For - That's affirm. - For Moon view attitude
     until [glossary:CM] platform release.

[05:08:35:43]
LMP: Okay. It says maneuver in ATT HOLD for Moon view
     attitude until [glossary:CM] platform release.

[05:08:35:49]
CC:  That's affirm. Better worded, it would have been
     maneuver and hold in attitude for Moon view,
     et cetera.

[05:08:36:00]
LMP: Okay. That's mainly for Jack to be able to get
     it in the optics, you mean.

[05:08:36:08]
CC:  Yes, that's correct. Okay, Fred - -

[05:08:36:11]
LMP: Okay.

[05:08:36:12]
CC:  Could you give us a readback on everything up to
     this point?

[05:08:36:20]
LMP: Okay. I'll go back to NORMAL VOICE. It might -
     Or is this pretty clear?

[05:08:36:24]
_page : 679
_tape : Tape 86/9
CC:  It's clear.

[05:08:36:40]
LMP: Okay. The master title, "Entry, LM PREP, [glossary:EI] minus
     6 hours." First, BAT 5 NORMAL FEED, ON; second,
     use modified [glossary:LM] [glossary:DPS]/[glossary:RCS], 30-minute activation checklist. Next, is at [glossary:TEI] minus 5 hours, [glossary:MCC]-7, if
     required. Now, we have a [glossary:LM] preentry procedure.
     First, we maneuver to service module SEP attitude.
     Second, configure for [glossary:CSM] hotfire. Under that,
     DEADBAND MAX, and ATTITUDE CONTROL, three, to
     PULSE. Thirdly, perform [glossary:CSM] hotfire. Fourth,
     we - The [glossary:LM] maneuvers back to [glossary:SM] SEP attitude,
     with ATTITUDE CONTROLs, PITCH and ROLL to PULSE,
     ATTITUDE CONTROL, YAW, to MODE CONTROL. Now, you
     got that so far, Vance?

[05:08:37:56]
CC:  That's correct so far, Fred-o.

[05:08:37:59]
LMP: Okay. At [glossary:EI] minus 4-1/2 hours, configure for [glossary:SM]
     SEP. First, BALANCE COUPLE, ON. Secondly, zero
     the counters in [glossary:AGS]; 404, 405, 406, plus 0; read
     out 470. Thirdly, translate plus-X to 0.5 foot
     per second. Fourth, CM/[glossary:SM] SEP. Fifth, after SEP,
     null 470 to 0. Sixth, ATTITUDE CONTROL, three,
     to PULSE. Seventh, pitch to acquire service module
     for photos. And a note, use the ACA for control.
     Last, we had - you gave me was [glossary:TEI] minus 3 hours.
     Maneuver in ATT HOLD for Moon view until the CM
     platform release.

[05:08:39:19]
CC:  Okay, Fred. Only - Only a minor point that we
     just picked up. At the very top, [glossary:EI] minus 6 hours,
     the title is "power up," above BAT 5 NORMAL FEED,
     ON.

[05:08:39:41]
LMP: Okay. The title above BAT 5 NORMAL FEED, ON, is
     "power up."

[05:08:39:46]
CC:  Okay. And on the last, it was maneuver and ATT
     HOLD for Moon view attitude until [glossary:CM] platform
     release. I think that's what you read. Okay.
     Ready to go on? [glossary:EI] minus - Are you there?

[05:08:40:04]
LMP: Okay. Next is - Okay. Next is [glossary:TEI] minus what,
     Vance?

[05:08:40:08]
CC:  It's - It's [glossary:EI] minus 2-1/2 hours, Fred.

[05:08:40:17]
LMP: Okay. [glossary:EI] minus 2-1/2.

[05:08:40:20]
CC:  Okay. The title, "Power removal from [glossary:CM] [glossary:LM]
     umbilical."

[05:08:40:53]
_page : 680
_tape : Tape 86/10
LMP: Okay. "Power removal from [glossary:CM] [glossary:LM] umbilical."

[05:08:41:00]
CC:  That's correct. Next, assumes - This assumes all
     descent batteries on line.

[05:08:41:14]
LMP: Okay. I'll put that as a note.

[05:08:41:31]
CC:  And ASCENT BATTERIES 5 and 6 on NORMAL FEED.

[05:08:41:52]
LMP: Okay. This assumes all descent BATs on line, and
     ASCENT BATs 5 and 6 on NORMAL FEED. Go ahead.

[05:08:41:57]
CC:  Roger. Next, [glossary:CSM] CB [glossary:LM] POWER 1, MAIN B to open.

[05:08:42:27]
LMP: Okay. [glossary:CSM], CB [glossary:LM] POWER 1, MAIN B, open.

[05:08:42:30]
CC:  Next. CB, [glossary:LM] POWER 2, MAIN B, open.

[05:08:42:42]
LMP: Okay. [glossary:CSM], CB [glossary:LM] POWER 2, MAIN B, open.

[05:08:42:47]
CC:  CB [glossary:EPS] SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN B to open.

[05:08:43:10]
LMP: Okay. CB [glossary:EPS] SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN B, open.

[05:08:43:14]
CC:  Okay. Next, the [glossary:LM]. CB, [glossary:EPS] panels 11 and 16,
     CROSS TIE BALANCE LOADS to close.

[05:08:43:55]
LMP: Okay. On the [glossary:LM] side now. CB [glossary:EPS] 11, panels 11
     and 16, CROSS TIE BAL LOADS, close.

[05:08:44:04]
CC:  That's correct. Next, CB [glossary:EPS] panel 16, BAT FEED
     TIE, two of them, open.

[05:08:44:40]
LMP: Okay. [glossary:LM], CB [glossary:EPS], panel 16, BAT FEED TIE, two,
     open.

[05:08:44:50]
CC: Okay. CB [glossary:EPS] 16, ASCENT ECA CONTROL to close.

     close.

[05:08:45:18]
CC:  Correct. BATTERY 1, HI VOLT - HIGH VOLTAGE to
     OFF/RESET.

[05:08:45:40]
LMP: Okay. BATTERY 1, HI VOLT, OFF/RESET.

[05:08:45:42]
CC:  BATTERY 5, OFF/RESET.

[05:08:45:55]
LMP: Okay. BATTERY 5, HI VOLT - or, it should be
     BATTERY 5 NORMAL FEED to OFF/RESET.

[05:08:46:04]
_page : 681
_tape : Tape 86/11
CC:  Roger. And - Stand by.

[05:08:46:13]
LMP: Or did you mean battery 2?

[05:08:46:17]
CDR: Yes. I think that's what he meant.

[05:08:46:22]
CC:  Okay. We mean BATTERY 5 to OFF/RESET.

[05:08:46:30]
LMP: Okay.

[05:08:46:33]
CC:  That's a NORMAL FEED.

[05:08:46:34]
LMP: BATTERY 5, NORMAL FEED - NORMAL FEED, OFF/RESET.
     Got you.

[05:08:46:39]
CC:  Okay. BAT 2, LOW VOLTAGE, OFF/RESET then ON.

[05:08:47:05]
LMP: Okay. BATTERY 2, LOW VOLT, OFF/RESET, then ON.

[05:08:47:11]
CC:  Next. BAT 2, HI VOLT, OFF/RESET, then ON.

[05:08:47:59]
LMP: Okay. You still there, Vance?

[05:08:48:01]
CC:  Roger. I didn't catch your readback, Fred.

[05:08:48:05]
LMP: Oh, okay. The last item was item 9, and that was
     BAT 2, LOW VOLT, OFF/RESET, then ON.

[05:08:48:12]
CC: Roger. After that, I gave another one. BAT 2,
     HI VOLT, OFF/RESET, then ON.

[05:08:48:39]
LMP: Okay. BAT 2, HI VOLT, OFF/RESET, then ON.

[05:08:48:42]
CC: Correct. BAT 1, HI VOLT, ON.

[05:08:48:55]
LMP: Okay. BAT 1, HI VOLT, ON.

[05:08:49:00]
CC:  BAT 5, NORMAL FEED, ON.

[05:08:49:15]
LMP: Okay. BAT 5, NORMAL FEED, ON.

[05:08:49:20]
CC:  CB, [glossary:EPS], 16, BAT FEED TIE, two of them, closed.

[05:08:49:45]
LMP: Okay. CB, [glossary:EPS], 16, BAT FEED TIE, two, closed.

[05:08:49:49]
CC:  Roger. Next. The LMP should transfer to the [glossary:CM].

[05:08:50:12]
LMP: Okay. I'll underline that one. LMP transfer to
     [glossary:CM].

[05:08:50:17]
CC:  Don't let them forget you.

[05:08:50:29]
_page : 682
_tape : Tape 86/12
CC:  Okay. And just before LMP transfer to [glossary:CM], we'd
     like to have you add another step, Fred. That
     is - -

[05:08:50:40]
LMP: Go ahead.

[05:08:50:41]
CC:  That is, CB, [glossary:EPS], ASCENT ECA CONTROL, open.

[05:08:51:08]
LMP: Okay. You want CB - CB, [glossary:EPS], that's on 16, I
     assume, ASCENT ECA CONTROL, open.

[05:08:51:19]
CC:  Affirm. Okay. This is [glossary:EI] minus 1 hour 45 minutes,
     next.

[05:08:51:44]
LMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[05:08:51:47]
CC:  Okay. Maneuver to [glossary:CM] [glossary:LM] JETT attitude.

[05:08:52:01]
CC:  And you'll have a pad for that attitude.

[05:08:52:12]
LMP: Okay. Maneuver to [glossary:CM] [glossary:LM] JETT attitude.

[05:08:52:16]
CC:  That's affirm. Matter of fact, Jack has a listing of your pads there, Fred-o, so you can review them after this is over.

[05:08:52:25]
LMP: Okay.

[05:08:52:30]
CC:  [glossary:EI] minus 1 hour 35 minutes. Configure - -

[05:08:52:40]
LMP: - - [glossary:EI] minus 1 hour 30.

[05:08:52:42]
CC:  That's correct. Configure for jettison.

[05:08:52:58]
LMP: Okay.

[05:08:52:59]
CC:  Under that, verify [glossary:CM] free.

[05:08:53:12]
LMP: Verify [glossary:CM] free.

[05:08:53:16]
CC:  Okay. Next, the COMM configuration. S-BAND, PM,
     PRIM.

[05:08:53:33]
LMP: Hold on. Say again now.

[05:08:53:35]
CC:  Okay. Next, COMM configuration.

[05:08:53:40]
LMP: This is for the command module?

[05:08:53:42]
CC:  Negative. The step above for [glossary:CM] free was command
     module, but the COMM is for [glossary:LM] again.

[05:08:53:55]
_page : 683
_tape : Tape 86/13
LMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[05:08:54:01]
CC:  Okay. S-BAND, PM, PRIMARY, PRIMARY again, OFF,
     PCM, RANGE, OFF, and HI.

[05:08:54:49]
LMP: Okay. Our S-BAND CONFIG is: PM, PRIM, PRIM, OFF,
     PCM, RANGE, OFF, HI.

[05:08:54:55]
CC:  That's correct. Stand by 1.

[05:08:55:24]
LMP: Do you have any druthers about which OMNI?

[05:08:55:26]
CC:  Yes. Select best OMNI.

[05:08:55:30]
LMP: Select - Did you say AFT, or best?

[05:08:55:33]
CC:  Best. Best in the west.

[05:08:55:38]
LMP: Okay. I was wondering if that's still going to
     be best after it leaves - But, okay. Select best
     OMNI at the time.

[05:08:55:43]
CC:  That's affirm. Okay. We've covered COMM, Fred.
     Next, [glossary:ECS].

[05:08:56:01]
LMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[05:08:56:04]
CC:  Okay. Under [glossary:ECS], FORWARD DUMP valve, close.

[05:08:56:21]

[05:08:58:31]
LMP: REPRESS VALVE, close.

[05:08:58:35]
CC:  SUIT FAN, OFF.

[05:08:58:41]
LMP: How many more steps, Vance?

[05:08:58:43]
CC:  Two after this, Fred-o.

[05:08:58:47]
LMP: Okay. Stand by.

[05:08:58:52]
CC:  Maybe you need a scroll, yet.

[05:08:58:56]
LMP: Yes.

[05:08:58:58]
CDR: I want to ask him why all these steps just to
     get rid of a [glossary:LM] that's going to burn up in a
     half hour. Seems ridiculous. God damn it. Too
     many guys - -

[05:08:59:08]
LMP:  SUIT FAN, OFF.

[05:08:59:10]
CDR: - - got in the act.

[05:08:59:15]
CC:  Okay. The last one was SUIT FAN, OFF. Hey, Jim,
     Deke said he thought you were asleep.

[05:08:59:38]
CDR: Okay. All these steps woke me up.

[05:08:59:46]
CC:  Okay. We'll try to be quieter. Except I don't
     know how. Okay, Fred-o - -

[05:08:59:55]
CDR: I got my audio breaker on.

[05:08:59:57]
CC:  Did you get SUIT FAN, OFF?

[05:09:00:01]
LMP: Yes. SUIT FAN, OFF.

[05:09:00:05]
CC:  Okay. Circuit breakers, panel - circuit breaker
     panel 16 rather. [glossary:ECS], CABIN REPRESS to open.

[05:09:00:37]
LMP: Okay. CB panel 16, [glossary:ECS], CABIN REPRESS, open.

[05:09:00:42]
CC:  Roger. OVERHEAD DUMP VALVE, closed. Maybe Jim
     has a point there, though.

[05:09:00:56]
LMP: Yes. OVERHEAD DUMP VALVE close, and it is already.

[05:09:01:02]
CC:  Right. Okay. That's all for the [glossary:ECS]. Next,
     ATTITUDE CONTROL, three, to MODE CONTROL.

[05:09:01:23]
_page : 685
_tape : Tape 86/15
LMP: Okay. Stand by 1.

[05:09:01:31]
CC:  Oh, stand by 1, Fred. We'd like to - change the
     position of that ATTITUDE CONTROL, three, MODE
     CONTROL to be just under [glossary:CM] free. That's a more
     convenient time.

[05:09:01:51]
LMP: Yes, I agree. Okay. Under, it'll be my item B,
     after verify [glossary:CM] free, it's ATT CONTROL, three, to
     MODE CONTROL.

[05:09:02:04]
CC:  And, along with that, DEADBAND, MAX.

[05:09:02:11]
LMP: Okay. Three to MODE CONTROL, comma, DEADBAND to
     MAX.

[05:09:02:18]
CC:  Next verify - -

[05:09:02:20]
LMP: If I don't sound too clear, it's because I'm
     holding a flashlight between my teeth.

[05:09:02:29]
CC:  Roger.

[05:09:02:33]
LMP: Okay.

[05:09:02:35]
CC:  Okay. Now - -

[05:09:02:36]
LMP: Okay. I think I'm - I'm up with you. Go ahead,
     Vance.

[05:09:02:39]
CC:  Okay. Now again down at the bottom beneath [glossary:ECS],
     verify transfer list.

[05:09:03:02]
LMP: Okay. Verify transfer list.

[05:09:03:06]
CC:  [glossary:IVT] to [glossary:CM], and close hatch.

[05:09:03:12]
LMP: What was that - What was the first part of that?

[05:09:03:15]
CC:  Transfer yourself to the [glossary:CM]. Or rather, [glossary:IVT], that's
     the commander to the [glossary:CM], and close hatch.

[05:09:03:25]
LMP: Okay.

[05:09:03:46]
LMP: Actually, it's commander transfer to [glossary:CM] and you
     mean close hatches. Plural, right?

[05:09:03:53]
CC:  That's correct. Yes.

[05:09:03:56]
LMP: Okay.

[05:09:04:01]
_page : 686
_tape : Tape 86/16
CC:  Okay. That's all for the time line, Fred. Now
     the contingency checklist, if it's handy.

[05:09:04:12]
LMP: Okay. Which page?

[05:09:04:15]
CC:  Turn to 30-minute activation on page 24.

[05:09:04:25]
LMP: Okay. I'm there.

[05:09:04:28]
CC:  Okay. Now, at this point, you have this section
     marked up already, so what I give you now represents additional DELTAs to your previously marked
     up checklist.

[05:09:04:43]
LMP: Okay. That's all right. I've got a different
     color pen, so it'll show up nicely. Go ahead.

[05:09:04:47]
CC:  Okay. Okay. Go down to item 4.

[05:09:04:54]
LMP: Roger.

[05:09:04:56]
CC:  Verify ACS STATUS switch, OFF. That's an addition.

[05:09:05:09]
LMP: Do you mean, under [glossary:IVT] to the [glossary:LM], number 4, [glossary:RCS]
     SYSTEM A/B-2, QUADs 4, AUTO? That 4?

[05:09:05:21]
CC:  That's affirm. Yes. It's the - the only 4 on
     that page 24 and it's a - presently has after it
     [glossary:RCS] SYSTEM A/B-2, QUADs, 4, to AUTO. Under that
     put - -

[05:09:05:34]
LMP: Roger.

[05:09:05:36]
CC:  - - put verify [glossary:AGS] STATUS switch to OFF.

[05:09:05:45]
LMP: Okay. Verify [glossary:AGS] STATUS switch OFF.

[05:09:05:49]
CC:  Okay. At the bottom of the page - Okay. You
     already have that. MODE CONTROL, both, OFF.

[05:09:06:05]
CC:  Okay. Next, page 26, circuit breakers.

[05:09:06:13]
LMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[05:09:06:16]
CC:  Okay. First row is okay as is. Second row, under
     FLIGHT DISPLAYS, GASTA should be closed.

[05:09:06:33]
LMP: Okay.

[05:09:06:34]
CC:  Under AC BUS A, close GASTA.

[05:09:06:43]
_page : 687
_tape : Tape 86/17
LMP: Okay. GASTA FLIGHT DISPLAYS and AC BUS A will be
     closed.

[05:09:06:47]
CC:  Roger. That's all on the second line. Now the
     third line, under STABILITY and CONTROL, ATCA
     (PGNS) to closed.

[05:09:07:03]
LMP: Okay. ATCA (PGNS) to close.

[05:09:07:05]
CC:  That's all on that line. Fourth line, near the
     right side, [glossary:LGC] STANDBY to close. And - -

[05:09:07:21]
LMP: Wait a minute. You mean [glossary:LGC]/[glossary:DSKY].

[05:09:07:25]
CC:  [glossary:LGC]/[glossary:DSKY]. I'm sorry.

[05:09:07:29]
LMP: Okay.

[05:09:07:30]
CC:  And [glossary:IMU] OPERATE, close.

[05:09:07:35]
LMP: Okay. [glossary:IMU] OPERATE, close.

[05:09:07:49]
LMP: Okay, Vance. [glossary:IMU] OPERATE, close.

[05:09:07:52]
CC:  That's correct. Okay. Fourth row is okay as is.
     Now we would like to add - add in a late arrival
     to row two. Under - -

[05:09:08:09]
LMP: Go ahead.

[05:09:08:10]
CC:  Under FLIGHT DISPLAYS, MISSION TIMER, closed.

[05:09:08:19]
LMP: Okay. FLIGHT DISPLAYS, MISSION TIMER, closed.
     We can look at the ghosties right to the end.

[05:09:08:26]
CC:  Yes, that's right. Okay. That's all for that
     page, Fred. That should add up to six circuit
     breakers all closed, on that page.

[05:09:08:39]
CDR: Vance, Jim.

[05:09:08:41]
CC:  Go ahead, Jim.

[05:09:08:43]
CDR: Have we looked seriously now at just the essential
     things required to make a safe [glossary:LM] jettison? We're
     not - I don't think we have the time to really do
     any engineering data that people might want to
     look at as this thing goes into the atmosphere.

[05:09:09:06]
CC:  Well, Jim. I - I think that that was what everybody aimed for, and people down here feel that
     it's the essentials, that it's what you need.

[05:09:09:19]
_page : 688
_tape : Tape 86/18
CDR:  Well, we'll do everything you think is essential,
     but I just don't want to be throwing switches at
     the last minute. What we're really thinking
     about, getting that command module in good shape.

[05:09:09:35]
CC:  Hey, Jim. This is Tom. The only reason we're
     bringing up the [glossary:PGNS] is to have another reference
     system just to control the [glossary:LM] when you jettison
     the thing. Over.

[05:09:09:45]
CDR: Okay. Okay, Tom. It's - I thought the - an [glossary:AGS]
     ATT HOLD would have been sufficient for this,
     when we first thought about this.

[05:09:09:53]
CC:  Yes. I agree. But we decided just in case we
     have any glitch with the [glossary:AGS], we want to make
     sure we get that [glossary:LM] off in a good shape. And I
     agree with you on keeping out all the garbage on
     it.

[05:09:10:03]
CDR: Okay, Tom.

[05:09:10:05]
CC:  Hey, would you like to have - -

[05:09:10:06]
CDR: Good night.

[05:09:10:07]
CC:  Would you like to have us play you some guitar
     music to put you to sleep?

[05:09:10:10]
CDR: (Laughter) Oh, you know how to get to a guy.

[05:09:10:14]
CC:  We'll even have a 12-string guitar for you, Jimbo.

[05:09:10:20]
CDR: Okay.

[05:09:10:23]
CC:  Okay, Fred. Page 28.

[05:09:10:28]
LMP: Okay. I'm looking at panel 16 now.

[05:09:10:32]
CC:  No - No changes to panel - -

[05:09:10:33]
LMP: ...

[05:09:10:34]
CC:  No changes to panel 16.

[05:09:10:38]
LMP: Okay. I'm on 28 now.

[05:09:10:41]
CC:  Right. Okay. At the top of the page, under step 4,
     just above "VHF/S-band activation," put in, "Delete
     POWER AMP and [glossary:LGC]." These are caution lights.

[05:09:11:07]
_page : 689
_tape : Tape 86/19
LMP: Okay. You mean delete PREAMP.

[05:09:11:10]
CC:  I'm sorry. PREAMP and [glossary:LGC].

[05:09:11:18]
LMP: Okay.

[05:09:11:22]
CC:  Okay. Under "VHF/S-band activation and checkout,"
     step 2, we have changes to the COMM as fellows.

[05:09:11:34]
LMP: Go ahead.

[05:09:11:40]
CC:  Okay. Scratch - Scratch out the DOWN and DOWN
     VOICE. That leaves - That'll give you VOICE.

[05:09:11:50]
LMP: Okay. That's the way we had it last time.

[05:09:11:54]
CC:  Okay. And, we'd like to insert RANGING.

[05:09:12:01]
LMP: Okay. Instead of OFF/RESET put RANGING.

[05:09:12:04]
CC:  That's correct.

[05:09:12:15]
LMP: Okay.

[05:09:12:17]
CC:  Okay. Under "[glossary:PGNS] turn-on," add in steps 1 and 2
     again, which are NO ATTITUDE light off, [glossary:VERB 96]
     ENTER, and set EVENT TIMER.

[05:09:12:35]
LMP: Okay. Steps 1 and 2 back in.

[05:09:12:38]
CC:  That's affirm. And underneath "Set EVENT TIMER,"
     add the following: [glossary:VERB 25] [glossary:NOUN 07], ENTER;
     1257, ENTER.

[05:09:13:04]
LMP: Okay. Go ahead, Vance.

[05:09:13:06]
CC:  Okay. If you got the 1257, ENTER, then 252,
     ENTER and ENTER.

[05:09:13:18]
LMP: Okay. After event, set EVENT TIMER, it's [glossary:VERB 25]
     [glossary:NOUN 07], ENTER; 1257, ENTER; 252 ENTER; ENTER.

[05:09:13:28]
CC:  Roger. And this activates your upfiring jets.

[05:09:13:35]
LMP: Say the last again, Vance.

[05:09:13:36]
CC:  Roger. What this does, Fred, is activate upfiring
     jets.

[05:09:13:41]
LMP: Oh, okay.

[05:09:13:43]
_page : 690
_tape : Tape 86/20
CC:  They're all - actually, all vertical jets.

[05:09:14:00]
LMP: Okay. I got it.

[05:09:14:01]
CC:  Okay. Next, same page, under "[glossary:DAP] set gimbal
     drive," go to step 2. Okay. Add in after NOUN 46,
     32021.

[05:09:14:31]
LMP: Okay. 32021.

[05:09:14:35]
CC:  Okay. Proceeding on down below the [glossary:NOUN 47], to
     the PROCEED, insert [glossary:VERB 34], ENTER, after the
     PROCEED. And that would come before the [glossary:NOUN 48].

[05:09:14:59]
LMP: Okay. To PRO and then do a [glossary:VERB 34].

[05:09:15:13]
CC:  Roger. Okay. We have some noise here, Fred.
     Stand by a minute.

[05:09:15:29]
LMP: I switched OMNIs. How's that?

[05:09:15:31]
CC:  Hey, that helped. Okay. No changes now on 29,
     30, and 31. Next page is 32.

[05:09:15:45]
LMP: Okay. I'm on 32.

[05:09:15:48]
CC:  Okay. At the very first step above "GUIDANCE
     CONTROL, [glossary:AGS]," put in [glossary:VERB 76], ENTER.

[05:09:16:02]
LMP: Okay. [glossary:VERB 76], ENTER.

[05:09:16:05]
CC:  Okay. Below "GUIDANCE CONTROL, [glossary:AGS]," the third
     step should be changed to be MODE CONTROL, both,
     to ATT HOLD.

[05:09:16:18]
LMP: Okay. You want MODE CONTROL, both, to ATT HOLD.

[05:09:16:21]
CC:  That's affirm.

[05:09:16:31]
LMP: Okay.

[05:09:16:32]
CC:  Okay. At minus 6 - 6 hours - or 6 minutes rather,
     under MODE CONTROL, [glossary:PGNS], ATT HOLD, which was
     scratched out, insert [glossary:VERB 41] [glossary:NOUN 20], ENTER, and
     three more ENTERs. So - So it's as shown in your
     procedure there.

[05:09:17:13]
LMP: Yes.

[05:09:17:14]
CC:  Okay - -

_page : 691
_tape : Tape 86/21
LMP: Coarse aline 000.

[05:09:17:17]
CC: Below that, put in [glossary:DEDA], 400 plus 5.

[05:09:17:35]
LMP: Okay. [glossary:DEDA], 400 plus 5.

[05:09:17:38]
CC:  Okay. Okay. We want back in again the next step
     which is "At burn attitude: [glossary:VERB 40] [glossary:NOUN 20], ENTER."

[05:09:17:56]
LMP: Okay.

[05:09:18:08]
CC: Okay. Proceeding on down, delete "At burn attitude" and the step above it, which is 400 plus 5.

[05:09:18:24]
LMP: 400 plus 5 and the "at burn attitude."

[05:09:18:28]
CC: Correct.

[05:09:18:39]
CC: Okay. That's all for page 32, Fred. Next, page 33.

[05:09:18:46]
LMP: Go ahead.

[05:09:18:49]
CC:  Okay. Under 4 minutes, minus 4 minutes, add back in MODE CONTROL, both, to ATT HOLD.

[05:09:19:10]
LMP: Okay. MODE CONTROL, both, to ATT HOLD.

[05:09:19:15]
CC:  Okay. Two steps below that, add back in [glossary:TTCA] COMMANDER THROTTLE MIN [glossary:DPS], and add in [glossary:DPS].

[05:09:19:36]
LMP: Wait a minute.

[05:09:19:39]
CC:  Stand by 1.

[05:09:19:41]
LMP: TTC - Yes. Seems like you should be in JETS, since
     this is going to be - is this going to be [glossary:RCS] or a
     [glossary:DPS] burn?

[05:09:19:49]
CC: Okay. This will be JETS for [glossary:RCS] and THROTTLE
     for [glossary:DPS].

[05:09:20:00]
LMP: What I don't understand is, what is this [glossary:MCC]
     likely to be? I thought it was going to be an [glossary:RCS].

[05:09:20:05]
CC: Well, we - We expect that, but we're remaining
     flexible.

[05:09:20:11]
LMP: (Laughter) Okay. Okay. I'll put in [glossary:TTCA] THROTTLE
     MIN for [glossary:DPS], JETS for [glossary:RCS].

[05:09:21:00]
LMP: Hold on, Vance; I don't understand. We want to
     delete everything on page 34?

[05:09:21:07]
CC:  No, that's not correct, Fred. What we wait to do
     is leave everything the way it is on 34, and add
     this one comment I'm giving you at the - at the
     bottom of it.

[05:09:21:17]
LMP: Oh, okay. Okay. I misunderstood. Okay. Go
     ahead with your added comment.

[05:09:21:43]
CC:  That's affirm. At [glossary:EI] minus 5 hours.

[05:09:21:48]
LMP: Okay. At [glossary:EI] minus 5 hours. Let me take a look
     and see how that flows, now.

[05:09:22:00]
CC:  Okay. And also you have a - -

[05:09:22:02]
LMP: Okay. That would be the [glossary:LM] - the [glossary:LM] preentry
     procedure. Yes. Okay.

[05:09:22:08]
CC:  That's correct, and, also on that page, you - from
     our last correct - or addition exercise, you have a
     section called "Reestablish [glossary:PTC]." We'd like to
     scratch all of that, of course.

[05:09:22:22]
LMP: Roger.

[05:09:22:46]
CC: Okay, Fred. That's all except for one comment that
     we have, and - just a second.

[05:09:25:09]
CC: Stand by 1. Fred, we're polling the room for
     comments here, any last minute thoughts from
     people. We'll be right back with you.

CC: Aquarius, Houston.

[05:09:28:17]
LMP: Okay, Go ahead.

[05:09:28:19]
CC: Okay, Fred. Just two changes, comments to what
     we just gave you. The first is near the front
     at [glossary:EI] - in the section under "[glossary:EI] minus 2-1/2 hours,"
     power removal from [glossary:CM] [glossary:LM] umbilical." We'll let
     you turn to that.

[05:09:28:44]
LMP: Okay, I'm there at "[glossary:EI] minus 2-1/2 hours, power
     removal [glossary:CM] [glossary:LM] umbilical."

[05:09:28:49]
CC: Okay. Under [glossary:LM], we have a step, BAT 2, LOW
     VOLTAGE, OFF/RESET, than ON. Next we have a
     step BAT 2, HI VOLTAGE. OFF/RESET, then ON. We
     request that you wait in between these two steps
     for us to give you a GO. In other words, we'd
     like to look and see that all the relays closed
     and all that sort of thing before you throw BAT 2,
     HI VOLTAGE, to OFF/RESET, and ON.

[05:09:29:33]
LMP: Okay, After BAT 2, LOW VOLTAGE, OFF/RESET, I'll -
     then ON, I'll wait for a [glossary:MSFN] GO before proceeding.

[05:09:29:42]
CC: Right-o. Okay. Next, at - Under the section of
     "[glossary:EI] minus 1 hour and 45 minutes" - No, change
     that. Correction, "[glossary:EI] minus 1 hour, 35 minutes,"
     refer to the [glossary:ECS] section, and we have a change.

[05:09:30:13]
LMP: All right. Go ahead, Vance.

[05:09:30:17]
CC:  Okay, Jim's right. We should cross out all this
     stuff with a couple of exceptions. FORWARD DUMP
     valve, closed, the first step, should remain.
     All other steps should be scratched, except for
     the last one, which is OVERHEAD DUMP valve, closed.
     That leaves two steps.

[05:09:30:45]
LMP: Okay. Under [glossary:ECS], we delete all except the first
     step, FORWARD DUMP valve, close, and step 10,
     which is OVERHEAD DUMP valve, closed, and leave
     in verify transfer list.

[05:09:31:06]
CC: That's affirm. Leave in what follows, which is
     verify transfer list and [glossary:IVT] and all that.

[05:09:31:28]
CC: [glossary:IVT], of course, meaning CDR transferring to the [glossary:CM].

[05:09:31:38]
_page : 694
_tape : Tape 86/24
LMP: We wouldn't forget it.

[05:09:31:43]
CC: Okay, Fred-o. That's - That's the changes. Not
     quite as extensive as the [glossary:CSM] had, but still pretty
     long. Any comments or questions to the house
     here?

[05:09:32:02]
LMP: No, it looks pretty good to me, Vance.

[05:09:32:06]
CC: Okay. Very good. Only other comment, aside from
     the checklist, we've been watching your descent
     stage water, and it looks - or your ascent stage
     water, and it looks real good.

[05:09:32:22]
LMP: Okay.

[05:09:32:42]
CC: Okay, Fred. We're going to try to refrain from
     calling you from now on, so that you can maybe
     get a couple of winks. We're getting a status
     around the room first, to see if anybody has any
     comments for you and, after that, we'll try to
     leave you alone for awhile.

[05:12:31:02]
LMP: Okay. You ought to have it now, Jack.

[05:12:31:09]
CC:  Okay. You're coming through good now, Fred. I've
     got three DELTAs to the checklist. They're
     minor changes. I'd like to pass them along now.
     One of them is to the [glossary:CSM] checklist. So if
     you'll pick that up, I'll give it to you.

[05:12:31:25]
LMP: Okay. Which one?

[05:12:31:29]
CC:  Okay. Stand by 1.

[05:12:31:33]
LMP: Is it the one Jack wrote them all in? The big
     long readout? He also wrote something in the
     G&N book.

[05:12:31:41]
_extra : Paga 690
CC:  It's in the big, long one he wrote out at about
     [glossary:EI] minus 02:30. [glossary:EMS] entry check.

[05:12:31:51]
_page : 697
_tape : Tape 88/2
LMP: Okay. He's coming back down with it.

[05:12:32:37]
CC:  Meanwhile, Fred, I've got two for you on the [glossary:LM]
     PREP checklist.

[05:12:32:44]
LMP: Okay. Jack's here now. I'll hand it to him.

[05:12:33:28]
CMP: Okay, Houston; Aquarius.

[05:12:33:32]
CC:  Hello, Aquarius. I've got a couple of changes
     for you on your [glossary:CSM] checklist.

[05:12:33:44]
CMP: Okay. Stand by 1.

[05:12:33:56]
CMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[05:12:34:00]
CC: Okay, Jack. The time line between [glossary:EI] minus 02:30
     and 1 hour is real crowded, so you're really
     going to have to hustle, and we've decided to
     delete the [glossary:EMS] entry check at minus 02:30. That'll
     give you a little more time in there. What we've
     decided to do with it is wait until after [glossary:EI] minus 1,
     just before you initialize the [glossary:EMS]. If you have
     time, and only if you have time, do the [glossary:EMS] entry
     check. Otherwise, forget it and go right on into
     [glossary:EMS] initialization. You understand?

[05:12:34:49]
CMP: Okay. You're going to delete between 2 hours and
     30 minutes and 02:15 there, and you're going to
     add it, if there is time, only if there is time,
     at [glossary:EI] minus 1 hour where the [glossary:EMS] initialization
     occurs .

[05:12:35:11]
CC:  That's right. You got it correctly. Okay, Jack.
     One other item. Just before [glossary:EI] minus 2 hours
     and 15 minutes, we need an E-memory dump
     [glossary:VERB 74] ENTER. Over.

[05:12:35:40]
CMP: Okay. Stand by 1, would you, please?

[05:12:36:24]
CMP: Okay. Right before 2 hours and 15 minutes, I
     assume that's before [glossary:MSFN] gives their [glossary:P27] update,
     I do a [glossary:VERB 74]. Right?

[05:12:36:34]
CC:  That's affirmative, Jack.

[05:12:36:54]
CC:  How much sleep did you get, Jack?

[05:12:37:01]
CMP: Oh, I guess - Stand by. I guess maybe 2 or 3 hours.
     It was awful cold, and it wasn't very good sleep.

[05:12:37:15]
_page : 698
_tape : Tape 88/3
CC:  Roger. You plan to try to get any more?

[05:12:37:20]
CMP: What [glossary:GET] do you have?

[05:12:37:24]
CC:  We got [time:05:12:37:00|132:37].

[05:12:37:40]
CMP: Well, if I - If I get everything done, I'll try,
     but I tell you, it's almost impossible to sleep.
     All of us have that same problem. It's just too
     cold to sleep.

[05:12:38:07]
CC:  Roger. The way we're looking at it, looks like
     you ought to have a couple 3 hours here before
     you have to really get with it.

[05:12:38:19]
CMP: We'll - we'll take it easy, but I - and we'll
     try to sleep, but it's just awful cold.

[05:12:38:33]
CC:  Present data indicates that your entry angle
     is minus 6.03 degrees. Your DELTA-V at the
     midcourse is going to 2.8 feet a second.

[05:12:38:45]
CMP: Okay. Copy.

[05:12:38:54]
CDR: Jack, this is Jim. I understand this is going
     to be an [glossary:RCS] burn.

[05:12:39:01]
CC: That's affirmative, Jim. It's going to be an
     [glossary:RCS] burn.

[05:12:39:05]
CDR: Okay.

[05:12:39:10]
CC:  And we need the SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF valve back
     to AUTO. Correction, back to CLOSE.

[05:12:39:24]
_extra : END OF TAPE
CMP: Hey, Jack, that's in work. And one thing,
     comparing Jim's checklist with my own, I find
     one difference there at [glossary:EI] minus 02:30. His
     checklist has me changing a - opening a [glossary:EPS]
     SENSOR SIGNAL circuit breaker right prior to
     turning off [glossary:LM] power. Is - I'd like to find out
     which checklist is correct.

[05:12:41:05]
_page : 699
_tape : Tape 89/1
CC:  Hey, Jack. The [glossary:LM] checklist is just for information to Jim.
     It's just to tell him that - that
     you're changing back to command module power.
     Your checklist is correct. Over.

[05:12:41:20]
CMP: Okay. And when do you figure that you'll be
     sending up the pads that you have?

[05:12:44:02]
CC:  Aquarius, all of your pads will be coming up in
     about 3-1/2 hours, at [glossary:EI] minus 06:30. And one
     thing we want to remind you of, when you remove
     power from the command module [glossary:LM] umbilical, is
     to be sure that you open the [glossary:LM] POWER MAIN B
     circuit breakers, both of them, before you start
     throwing switches and circuit breakers in the
     [glossary:LM]. Do it as we've outlined it in the procedure,
     in that order. Over.

[05:12:44:33]
LMP: Okay. That's the way we planned on it. We'll
     let Jack do his three and then he'll tell us
     when we're GO from there. What pages are those
     changes on?

[05:12:44:48]
CC:  Okay, Fred. The one I've got for you is at the
     end of power removal from the command module [glossary:LM]
     umbilical. And just for your information, after
     you go through that entire procedure and about
     the time you're ready to transfer to the command
     module, at that time, power will be removed from
     the umbilical, and it's okay to disconnect it.
     That is, after you've thrown the switches in the
     [glossary:LM]. Is that clear?

[05:12:45:21]
LMP: Roger. That's where I've got a remark here to
     check with you to see if it's all right to proceed.

[05:12:45:28]
CC:  Roger. And that would be just after, on panel 16,
     you opening ASCENT ECA CONTROL breakers.

[05:12:45:42]
LMP: Which step number is that?

[05:12:46:03]
LMP: The confusing thing is, Jack, where they told
     me to wait for [glossary:MSFN] GO before proceeding was
     that BAT 2 LOW VOLTS OFF/RESET, then ON.

[05:12:46:12]
CC:  Okay. That's still affirmative. We'll give you
     a go after waiting 5 seconds, and then down from
     there just a few steps, after you have opened
     the ASCENT ECA CONTROL breakers on panel 16, at that point, the
     umbilical is not powered, and it's okay to disconnect them should
     you care to do so.

[05:12:46:35]
_page : 700
_tape : Tape 89/2
LMP: Okay. After the last step then, I'm free to
     disconnect.

[05:12:46:39]
CC:  Right. And one other change we have is, shortly
     after that, where we're configuring for jettison,
     we have closed both the FORWARD DUMP valve and
     the OVERHEAD DUMP valve. And we don't want to
     get in a locked up position like that, so one
     way to get around it is to - After we close the
     FORWARD DUMP valve, turn the DESCENT OXYGEN valve
     off. Over.

[05:12:47:17]
LMP: Okay. After the FORWARD DUMP valve, add a step
     in that says the DESCENT OX valve, off.

[05:12:47:31]
CC:  Okay, Fred. That concludes the DELTAs. And
     perhaps you heard that our GAMMAs are still
     minus 6.03 and our DELTA-V will be a 2.8-foot-per-second [glossary:RCS] burn.

[05:12:47:46]
LMP: Roger.

[05:12:48:23]
CC:  Fred-o, we've got one more change we'd like to
     give you to clarify a question that Jack asked
     earlier. At [glossary:EI] minus 02:30 - -

[05:12:48:35]
LMP: Okay. Hold on a minute, Jack. I meant to call
     Jack back down. I'm not familiar with the previous discussion.

[05:12:48:42]
CC:  Negative. This is on your checklist.

[05:12:48:47]
LMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[05:12:48:49]
CC: At E mi - [glossary:EI] minus 02:30, during power removal
     from the umbilical, first thing we do is two
     steps with the [glossary:CSM]. We open the MAIN B, the [glossary:LM]
     POWER to MAIN B circuit breakers, and then there's
     a third step which says "Circuit breaker [glossary:EPS]
     SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN B, open." Just delete that
     step. Over.

[05:12:49:18]
LMP: Okay. Delete the third step.

[05:12:50:38]
CC:  And, Aquarius, for your information, as far as
     our water supply is concerned, including our
     plans for powerup, we have an additional 18 hours of water
     remaining from this point.

[05:12:51:01]
_page : 701
_tape : Tape 89/3
LMP: Okay. Eighteen hours of water remaining from
     this point, Jack.

[05:12:51:26]
CDR: Hello, Houston; Aquarius.

[05:12:51:29]
CC:  Hello, Aquarius. Go ahead.

[05:12:51:32]
CDR: Okay, Jack. This is Jim. I just want to make
     sure that you're filtering the changes to the
     checklist that come up to make sure that they're
     absolutely essential. When we learn our procedures, we can only do it one time, and we can't
     make changes at the last minute. We'd like to
     do the best, the safest way possible, but unless
     the changes are really essential, don't bother
     sending them up.

[05:12:51:57]
CC:  Roger. We won't. The chairman of the [glossary:CPCB] is
     still active, and one thing we're trying to do
     is to save you all the time we can between [glossary:EI]
     minus 02:30 and 1 hour.

[05:12:52:10]
CDR: That's affirm. That's a real important time.

[05:12:52:14]
F: Yes. For your information, Jim, I don't know
     whether you heard that originally, but that
     time from 2-1/2 to 1 in there has been run
     about three times, and it's pretty tight, so
     we've tried to weed out what we could, which
     isn't much, but I think the other message you
     might impress on Jack when you get around to
     alining that platform, don't try to get it
     down too neat. It doesn't have to be all
     that good. Just do a nice quick and dirty
     one, and that's going to be good enough anyway.

[05:12:52:43]
CDR: I concur. I think for reentry we don't have
     to have a real accurate platform, but I haven't
     told Jack that.

[05:12:52:50]
F: Roger. Hey, Jim, while you're up and things
     are nice and quiet, let me give you a couple of
     other things to think about. One specifically.
     I know none of you are sleeping worth a damn
     because it's so cold, and you might want to
     dig out the medical kit there around 01:35 or
     in that ballpark, and pull out a couple of
     Dexedrines apiece and try one about then, and
     another around 01:39 to 01:40.

[05:12:53:15]
_page : 702
_tape : Tape 89/4
CDR: Well, I hadn't brought that up. We might -
     We might consider it.

[05:12:53:17]
F: Okay.

[05:12:53:39]
F: Wish we could figure a way to get a hot cup of
     coffee up to you. It'd probably taste pretty
     good about now, wouldn't it?

[05:12:53:46]
CDR: Yes, it sure would. You don't realize how cold
     this thing becomes when it's in a [glossary:PTC] mode that's
     slowing down, and I just clocked the cycles on
     my ... And it's about 11 to 12 minutes now, and
     the Sun is directly overhead, so it's shining on
     the engine bell of the service module and not
     getting down to the spacecraft at all.

[05:12:54:16]
F: Hang in there. It won't be long now.

[05:12:54:19]
CDR: Yes. That's right. As a matter of fact, doing
     this alinement on the Earth this time will be
     like making a landing with a fogged-up windshield.

[05:13:21:53]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:13:22:06]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[05:13:22:08]
CC:  Okay, Skipper. We figured out a way for you to
     keep warm. We decided to start powering you up
     now, and what we want you to do - what we want
     you to do is take your entry [glossary:LM] PREP checklist
     and start at the top where it says "BAT 5 NORMAL
     FEED on," and then jump over as it says to your
     30-minute activation, and do all of the 30-minute
     activation up to, but not including, the burn.
     You copy?

[05:13:22:52]
CDR: Okay. If I understand you correctly, then that
     gives me leeway to maneuver when we get up to
     activation complete, and we can be in position
     for the burn, but we will not burn. We don't
     have a pad anyway.

[05:13:23:15]
CC:  That's affirm, Jim. You could maneuver to burn
     attitude, or you could maneuver to an attitude
     which should put the Sun in the windows to warm
     the place up.

[05:13:23:23]
CDR: Sounds good, and you're sure we have plenty of
     electrical power to do this?

[05:13:23:29]
_page : 703
_tape : Tape 89/5
CC: That's affirmative. We've got plenty of power
     to do it. I can get you a number, though.

[05:13:23:37]
F: Jim, you've got about 100-percent margins on everything from
     here on in.

[05:13:23:45]
CDR: That sounds encouraging.

[05:13:23:46]
F: Roger. That's in the [glossary:LM]. We're not talking
     about the [glossary:CSM] right now.

[05:13:23:52]
CDR: I understand.

[05:13:30:36]
LMP: Houston, Aquarius.

[05:13:30:39]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[05:13:30:43]
LMP: Okay. Question. This short turnon step 3 on
     page 24 has us only turning on the [glossary:RCS] SYSTEM
     A/B, two quads, and the breakers are still out
     on panel 11. Did you want those in, too, or
     are we just going to use one set of heaters?

[05:13:31:02]
CC:  Stand by.

[05:13:31:32]
CC: Aquarius, Houston. Go as the checklist recommends for now. When you get into the circuit
     breaker panel configuration, you're going to
     get the number 1 set of heaters on anyway.

[05:13:31:44]
LMP: Okay.

[05:13:34:14]
LMP: Okay, Houston. We'd like to get a hack to set
     our mission timer here, Jack.

[05:13:34:21]
CC:  Okay, Fred-o. Set it at [time:05:13:35:00|133:35] straight up.
     You've got about 30 seconds to set it.

[05:13:34:49]
LMP: Okay. Standing by.

[05:13:34:52]
CC:  Okay. I'll give you the 2-second delay in there.
     Stand by to start.

[05:13:34:59]
CC:  START.

[05:13:35:03]
LMP: Okay. We've got it.

[05:13:35:05]
CC:  Okay. I'm counting [time:05:13:35:10|133:35:10].

[05:13:35:11]
LMP: Right on.

[05:13:35:41]
_page : 704
_tape : Tape 89/6
CC: Aquarius, Houston. One other way to warm things
     up in a hurry in there is when you get your AC
     on to turn on the window heaters.

[05:13:35:58]
LMP: Okay. I guess the only question I have is what
     it's liable to do to us with the - looks like
     almost a frost on it now.

[05:13:36:25]
LMP: Understand this, Jack. I'd like to let it maybe
     warm up just a little bit more before hitting it
     with the heat load.

[05:13:36:33]
CC:  Not a bad idea.

[05:13:38:26]
LMP: And, as you can see, Houston, at turnon we got
     our old friend downlink 2 back.

[05:13:38:37]
CC:  Roger. We're seeing it, Fred.

[05:13:41:08]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. It looks like you're proceeding
     toward the gimbal lock there. We'd like you to
     check that, please.

[05:13:41:20]
CDR: Roger. Not much we can do about it. We can't use
     the thrusters, Houston.

[05:13:41:32]
CC:  Okay. Forget it now; we'll get it later.

[05:13:44:44]
LMP: And, Houston, Aquarius. I guess the next thing
     for the [glossary:PGNS] will be a coarse aline 000, but I
     guess we ought to hold up now until we get enough
     time on the [glossary:RCS] thrusters.

[05:13:44:56]
CC:  Roger. We're looking at them. We'll give you
     the GO on them. Okay, Aquarius. Your quads
     are 120 to 133 now, so you're cleared for -
     Cleared for thrusters.

[05:13:47:48]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:13:47:52]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:13:47:53]
CC:  Roger. Did you get my GO for [glossary:RCS]?

[05:13:47:56]
CDR: That's affirm. We're GO. What we're doing now,
     Jack, is letting the spacecraft drift in this
     mode to pick up the Earth again.

[05:13:48:00]
CC:  Okay.

[05:13:48:07]
CDR: I don't want to just go blasting around the sky
     and get high rates, because I don't have anything
     to null the rates on until the Earth comes back
     up again. And - Once I get the Earth in sight,
     we have no strain on nulling rates. That part
     of the Earth, that is.

[05:13:53:50]
_page : 705
_tape : Tape 89/7
CDR: It's going to be interesting today, Jack. The
     Earth's a lot bigger; the crescent is a lot
     more pronounced than it was yesterday.

[05:13:54:04]
CC:  Well, you're going in the right direction.

[05:13:54:10]
CDR: That's right.

[05:13:55:27]
LMP: And, Jack, I guess we haven't changed our angle
     much with respect to the Sun 93 million miles
     away, so it ought to be in about the same place
     in the [glossary:AOT], isn't that Charlie?

[05:13:55:50]
CC:  Hold 1 on that, Fred. I'll get an answer for
     you.

[05:13:55:54]
LMP: Okay.

[05:13:57:20]
CC:  Aquarius, your ASA is warmed up now. You can
     activate the [glossary:AGS].

[05:13:57:26]
LMP: Okay.

[05:14:00:46]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. When you look out a detent
     2 in the proper burn attitude, what you ought
     to see is the Sun at 12 o'clock, about halfway
     between the top of the [glossary:AOT] and the center of the
     pipper. And you ought to see the Earth - -

[05:14:01:03]
LMP: Okay.

[05:14:01:04]
CC:  - - at 6 o'clock.

[05:14:01:07]
LMP: Okay.

[05:14:01:41]
CDR: And, it's getting a little warmer in here now.
     Thank you.

[05:14:01:58]
CC:  Duck blinds are always warmer, Jim, when the
     birds are flying.

[05:14:02:06]
CDR: Right.

[05:14:02:47]
CDR: Jack, I've gotten so used to flying attitude
     with the [glossary:TTCA], I won't be able to do it normally.

[05:14:02:56]
_page : 706
_tape : Tape 89/8
CC:  Say again, Jim.

[05:14:02:59]
CDR: I said I've gotten so used to flying attitude
     with the translational control, I won't be able
     to do with the ACA.

[05:14:06:06]
CC:  Aquarius, we see your glycol temperature getting
     up there. If you want to make it a little warmer,
     or you can try putting your SUIT TEMP valve to
     HIGH, if you haven't already got it there.

[05:14:06:25]
LMP: Okay.

[05:14:10:45]
CC:  Aquarius, something we're thinking about right
     now is, if we can do it without using a lot of
     [glossary:RCS], it would be to our advantage timewise to
     try to get an alinement.

[05:14:11:00]
CDR: Okay. You mean a [glossary:P52]?

[05:14:11:05]
CC: We're - -

[05:14:11:06]
CDR: I'll ... around.

[05:14:11:07]
CC:  A combination of 51 and 52.

[05:14:11:15]
CDR: I'll see what we can do, Jack.

[05:14:11:18]
_extra : END OF TAPE
CC: Okay. And we'd planned to use the Moon and the Sun for that.

[05:14:14:46]
_page : 707
_tape : Tape 90/1
CC: Aquarius, Houston. On panel 16, we'd like for
     you to close the CROSS TIE BAL LOADS breaker,
     please.

[05:14:14:57]
CMP: Okay. It's closed.

[05:14:15:04]
CC:  And it looks like we could support a - an alinement
     in a few minutes, if you'd be willing to go
     ahead with that.

[05:14:15:13]
CDR: Jack, it sounds good. I think from our position
     here, we know where the Sun and Moon are and it's
     strictly going to be a pitch maneuver. But I
     think we can save some gas. I'll see what we can
     do.

[05:14:15:24]
CC: Roger.

[05:14:22:58]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[05:14:23:00]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[05:14:23:02]
CDR: We're all set to go. Are you going to ship us
     up a [glossary:REFSMMAT]?

[05:14:23:06]
CC:  Yes, we are. Stand by 1.

[05:14:23:09]
CDR: Okay.

[05:14:23:25]
CDR: The Sun feels wonderful. It's shining in the
     rendezvous window.

[05:14:23:32]
CC:  And, Aquarius, before we can ship you a load,
     we'll have to have, on panel 11, under COMM, the
     UPDATA LINK circuit breaker closed.

[05:14:23:54]
CDR: It's closed.

[05:14:24:00]
CC:  Roger. It'll be a few - -

[05:14:24:01]
CDR: ... closed ... -

[05:14:24:02]
CC:  Okay. And it'll be a few minutes yet, Jim.
     We're still cranking it up.

[05:14:24:10]
LMP: Okay. Stay with it, Jack, and I'll go back to
     data.

[05:14:24:15]
CC:  Roger.

[05:14:25:02]
_page : 708
_tape : Tape 90/2
LMP: I got BAT in about 33-1/3 percent on that uplink.
     Too fast alarm.

[05:14:25:13]
CC:  Say again on that, Fred.

[05:14:25:20]
LMP: I just got another uplink too fast when I took
     the DATA switch back off - It's happening, I
     guess, about a third of the time.

[05:14:25:25]
CC:  Roger.

[05:14:28:11]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We're ready with your load
     if you'll give us DATA please.

[05:14:28:16]
CDR: Going to DATA. You got it.

[05:14:34:42]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. After the uplink, you'll have
     to set the drift and the [glossary:REFSMMAT] flag as on
     page 8 of the contingency book, steps 5 and 6.

[05:14:34:55]
CDR: Page 8, steps 5 and 6. Roger.

[05:14:37:21]
LMP: Okay. Are you done with the computer now, Jack?

[05:14:37:24]
CC: Negative. We'll give you the word.

[05:14:37:27]
F: Roger. Aquarius, we're through with it, it's
     your computer.

[05:14:37:32]
CDR: Thank you.

[05:14:39:32]
CC:  And, Aquarius, Houston; take option 1 on a [glossary:P52]
     when you get to it. And I've got some ball
     angles for a Sun and Moon.

[05:14:39:46]
LMP: Okay. We want an option 1 and you've got some
     ball angles for Sun and Moon. And right now,
     Jim has the Sun pretty well squared away right
     in the middle of [glossary:AOT].

[05:14:43:19]
LMP: And have you got some plan in vectors for us,
     Jack?

[05:14:43:37]
CC:  Okay, Fred-o. For the Sun, I've got 246; for
     the Moon I've got 250.

[05:14:43:55]
LMP: Are you talking about ball theta angles?

[05:14:43:59]
CC:  Negative. I was - I was reporting the code for
     [glossary:NOUN 70].

[05:14:44:07]
_page : 709
_tape : Tape 90/3
F: They're in the computer, Fred.

[05:14:44:10]
LMP: Oh, okay.

[05:14:49:06]
CDR: Okay, Houston. We have the Sun marks and I'll
     start up at pitch now to go over and pick up
     the Moon.

[05:14:49:14]
CC:  Roger.

[05:14:53:22]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[05:14:53:24]
CC:  Go ahead.

[05:14:53:27]
CDR: Just as a note of interest in this dock configurations 
     for [glossary:P52]s, the command module docking
     probe is right down the middle of - the docking
     light, rather, is right down the middle of the
     detent. And when the Sun flashes on, it really
     makes it difficult.

[05:14:53:48]
CC:  Roger.

[05:15:02:10]
CDR: Just like the simulator.

[05:15:02:15]
CC:  Yes. It was good training.

[05:15:02:35]
CDR: Well, Jack, that's what it says the torquing
     angles are.

[05:15:02:39]
CC:  We haven't got them yet.

[05:15:02:51]
CC:  Aquarius, hold on to torquing angles, please.

[05:15:02:55]
CDR: We're doing that.

[05:15:03:18]
CC:  Jim, the reason for the delay is that we're not
     seeing the data yet. We're having to check a
     point here; and as soon as they come up, we'll
     let you know what to do with them.

[05:15:03:30]
CDR: Okay. We had a large NOUN 105 of - what - 112,
     and our torquing angles, Jack, are minus 01713,
     minus 03278, minus 01395.

[05:15:03:53]
CC:  Roger. Minus 01713, and we see them now.

[05:15:04:17]
CC:  Aquarius, torque them.

[05:15:04:20]
CDR: Okay.

[05:15:04:28]
_page : 710
_tape : Tape 90/4
CDR: At [time:05:15:04:25|35:04:25].

[05:15:06:10]
CC:  Aquarius, do you have a star close by there you
     could check?

[05:15:06:18]
CDR: I'll look around, Jack. I was just trying to
     get a check on the Moon, again, to see if those
     angles were indeed true, and we got the Moon
     back again and centered.

[05:15:06:27]
CC:  Roger.

[05:15:10:09]
CDR: Okay, Jack. What you're reading now the angles?
     We had the Moon centered, and it's pretty close
     to what we have on the 8 ball, I guess. Close
     enough for any entry that we'd like to do.

[05:15:10:20]
CC:  Roger. And I'm told that Denubla - Denebola and
     Regulus are nearby if you wanted to make a star
     check.

[05:15:10:35]
CDR: Okay. I'm going to start pitching around again,
     and I'll see if I can pick them up. I have Orion
     out here to my left a little bit, but it's pretty
     close to the - oh, here. I've got Sirius. That's
     a nice one. How about that?

[05:15:10:55]
CC:  Sounds good here.

[05:15:14:44]
CC:  Aquarius, is Jack sitting on the rumble seat
     there?

[05:15:14:48]
LMP: He was. He just headed upstairs to take another
     look around.

[05:15:14:53]
CC:  Okay. I got a minor addition to the entry checklist for him. This time it's in the - -

[05:15:14:58]
LMP: Okay. Stand - -

[05:15:15:00]
CC:  - - entry book.

[05:15:15:02]
LMP: Okay. Stand by 1. He has that in his pocket.

[05:15:15:54]
CDR: What I'm doing, Jack, is just - I'm pitching
     over now. I'm going to pick up another star.
     Sirius was just too far off. I thought I was
     going to use too much gas getting there.

[05:15:16:05]
CC:  Roger.

[05:15:16:08]
_page : 711
_tape : Tape 90/5
CDR: By the time I get alined in the - in the [glossary:AOT] -
     be nice if we didn't have Odyssey attached, we could just AUTO -
     AUTO maneuver over to these things.

[05:15:16:28]
CC:  Looks to us like you've got her alined, Jim, so
     I wouldn't worry about it too much.

[05:15:16:33]
CDR: Yes. I'm pretty confident that the platform's
     fairly decent.

[05:15:17:38]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We need an E MOD [glossary:VERB 74],
     when you've got a chance, please.

[05:15:17:43]
CDR: Okay. Coming to you.

[05:15:22:35]
CC:  Okay, Jack. On your entry checklist, on page 2-5.
     Down there on step 9, where it says 152 degrees
     pitch at .05g, adjacent to that, so that Recovery
     can see you better on the way down, we want you
     to turn your S-BAND, POWER AMPLIFIER to HIGH.
     Over.

[05:15:23:25]
CMP: Okay. Turn S-BAND, POWER AMP to HIGH at .05g
     time.

[05:15:23:37]
CC:  That's affirmative.

[05:15:23:49]
CMP: Okay. Is that it?

[05:15:23:52]
CC:  That's it, Jack.

[05:15:32:42]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We're considering doing the
     midcourse with [glossary:PGNS], unless you'd rather do it
     in [glossary:AGS].

[05:15:32:52]
CDR: No. [glossary:PGNS] is fine with me. I just aline myself
     up with the old ball again. So I've got you
     foresighted again, but any way you want to do it.

[05:15:33:02]
CC:  Like you say, you might as well go first class.

[05:15:33:07]
CDR: I guess you're right.

[05:15:33:14]
LMP: Now wait a minute, Jack.

[05:15:33:22]
CC:  I just lost a lot of friends there.

[05:15:35:20]
LMP: And, Jack, you can tell Owen Morris that the [glossary:RCS]
     SYSTEM A/B 2 QUAD 1 breaker is still nicely in.

[05:15:35:52]
_page : 712
_tape : Tape 90/6
CC: Roger. We'll pass the word.

[05:15:38:21]
CC: Aquarius, Houston. We think we've figured out
     a way to save you some time at a very critical -
     very full schedule. And that's by doing a
     docked coarse aline, since we got the [glossary:LM] up now.
     That would save you a maneuver or two.

[05:15:39:38]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius. It seemed to me a docked
     coarse aline might be quicker for - for Jack.

[05:15:39:45]
CC:  Yes. We think it would be, and it'd save quite
     a bit of time at a place where you're going to
     be pretty busy. Also save you some petrol.

[05:15:39:56]
CMP: Affirm.

[05:15:40:13]
CC:  Okay, Jim. We're looking at doing this in the
     service module SEP attitude, and the optics will
     be pointed away from the Sun. So it should be a
     good attitude for a [glossary:P52].

[05:15:40:34]
CDR: Okay. So, we'll be going to the service module
     SEP attitude, at which time we'll do a docked
     coarse aline, and -

[05:15:40:54]
CDR: Then you want - You want Jack then to do a [glossary:P52]7

[05:15:41:20]
CC:  The way we'll do that in our time line Jim, is
     to go ahead and do the service module JETT and
     then we'll just stay in that attitude and when
     it comes time in our time line as we've outlined,
     to bring the platform up, we'll proceed with the
     [glossary:P52] - coarse aline, and then the [glossary:P52].

[05:15:41:40]
CDR: Okay. Are we going to use the same techniques
     that we normally do for [glossary:LM] activation? In other
     words, I try to maintain an attitude, and give
     him some angles and then - Are you going to give
     him the angles? Then he does the 52.

[05:15:41:57]
CC:  Basically, it's the same procedure just reversed,
     Jim.

[05:15:42:01]
CDR: Okay.

[05:15:42:02]
CC:  Another nice thing about this, is it's one we've
     done before.

[05:15:42:40]
CC:  And, Aquarius. One thing, however, that we do
     not plan to do is to proceed with the command
     module powerup prematurely.

CMP: Roger.

[05:15:42:57]
CDR: Understand.

[05:15:45:27]
CMP: Okay, Houston. This is Jack.

[05:15:45:32]
_extra : END OF TAPE
CC:  Go ahead, Jack.

[05:15:45:33]
_page : 714
_tape : Tape 91/1
CMP: Okay. I just wanted to talk over with you, it
     looks like we've had some changes in the flight
     plan here, due to Jim's [glossary:P52]. Do you have - Can
     you talk over with me what your plans are?

[05:15:45:50]
CC:  Roger, Jack. Since we've got the [glossary:PGNS] up, we
     plan to use that information to give the [glossary:CMC] a
     dock coarse aline, and then we're in the service
     module jettison attitude, we'll wait until it
     comes time to power up the [glossary:CMC], and we'll get
     the [glossary:CMC] a dock coarse aline, and we'll pick some
     good stars to give you a fine aline with, and it
     looks like we can pick some stars that are looking
     away from the Sun in which you can find in that
     service module jettison attitude; so, we'll save
     you quite a bit of gas: and save you some time
     in a very busy time.

[05:15:46:36]
CMP: Hey, that sounds good. Really fine.

[05:15:46:40]
CC:  Keeping warm?

[05:15:46:43]
CMP: Hey, it's warmed up here now. It's almost comfortable.

[05:15:46:52]
CDR: I'm looking out the window now, Jack, and that
     Earth is whistling in like a high-speed freight
     train.

[05:15:47:13]
CC:  We're clocking you at 48 000 miles and coming in at about 9000.

[05:15:47:21]
CDR: I don't think there's many [glossary:LM]s that have seen it
     like this. I'm still looking for Fra Mauro and
     Cone Crater.

[05:15:47:38]
F:  You're going the wrong way, son.

[05:15:48:29]
CMP: Okay, Jack. It looks - just looking over what I
     may expect here, it looks like I'm just going to
     get three angles to do a [glossary:VERB 41] [glossary:NOUN 20], right?

[05:15:48:45]
CC:  That's what it looks like from here, Jack. It's
     pretty much the opposite of the [glossary:LM] activation
     procedure where we do the dock coarse aline.

[05:15:49:05]
CMP: Yes, except in a way we did a lot of [glossary:VERB 06]
     [glossary:NOUN 20], ENTERS, simultaneously, and then you
     all shipped him up post-torque values. You're
     not going to do anything like that are you?

[05:15:49:20]
_page : 715
_tape : Tape 91/2
CC:  Say again, please, Jack.

[05:15:49:23]
CC:  Okay. During the activation part, we do a lot
     of [glossary:VERB 06] [glossary:NOUN 20], ENTERS simultaneously, reading
     you out the difference in the angles, and then
     [glossary:MSFN] furnishes the post-torquing angles, in
     order to get the platform fine alined. Do you
     plan something like that or just three coarse
     aline angles.

[05:15:49:53]
CC:  Jack, we're going to give you three coarse aline
     angles, and then you can go right to your checklist as we're giving it,
     and start in with the [glossary:VERB 40] [glossary:NOUN 20].

[05:15:50:07]
CMP: Okay. Real fine.

[05:15:52:45]
LMP: And, Jack, how do you read?

[05:15:52:48]
CC:  Fine - square.

[05:15:52:54]
LMP: I was around shooting pictures of all the debris
     inside here, before we left, and I inadvertently
     changed the settings on the DC command module
     Reseau camera that we need for the service module
     pictures. I wonder if FAO can dig them out again -
     what we need, f-stop and speed.

[05:15:53:18]
CC:  Okay, Fred. Stand by.

[05:15:54:55]
CC:  Fred, in regards to the camera settings, for
     black-and-white 3400 film, the settings were
     f:5.6 at 1/250th. Over.

[05:15:55:09]
LMP: Okay. I'd guessed right after all, but thank you.

[05:16:04:59]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[05:16:05:03]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[05:16:05:04]
CC:  Okay, Jim. I got [glossary:MCC]-7 pad when you're ready to
     copy. Over.

[05:16:05:09]
CDR: Okay. Stand by.

[05:16:05:35]
LMP: Okay. We're in luck, I got one pad left.

[05:16:05:38]
CC:  Okay. We'll take care not to change this one.
     Ready to go?

[05:16:05:45]
_page : 716
_tape : Tape 91/3
LMP: Go ahead, Joe.

[05:16:05:46]
CC:  [glossary:MCC]-7: [time:05:17:39:48|137:39:48.39], minus 0003.1, plus all
     zeros, plus 00001, N/A, plus 0020.5, 0003.1,
     0:23, 008, 359; the rest is N/A. Remarks: plus-X,
     four jets, [glossary:RCS]; and your weights for the [glossary:DAP] load:
     [glossary:LM] weight, 25181; [glossary:CSM] weight, 62468. Over.

[05:16:07:02]
LMP: Okay, Joe. [glossary:MCC]-7: [time:05:17:39:48|137:39:48.39], minus 0003.1,
     plus all balls, plus 0000.1, N/A, plus 0020.5,
     plus 0003.1, 0:23, 008 359; the rest of pad N/A.
     Remarks: plus-X, four jets, [glossary:RCS], ullage; the
     [glossary:LM] weight, 25181; [glossary:CSM] weight, 62468. Over.

[05:16:07:51]
CC:  Okay. Readback correct.

[05:16:08:22]
CC:  And, Aquarius; Houston. I have a service module
     SEP pad if you want to copy that, now. Over.

[05:16:08:32]
LMP: Say again, Joe.

[05:16:08:34]
CC:  Roger, Fred. I have a service module SEP pad with
     the attitudes. You don't need a pad sheet for it;
     just any old blank sheet will do.

[05:16:08:49]
LMP: Okay. I was going to say I don't - We don't hardly
     carry a service module SEP pad.

[05:16:08:56]
CC:  Yes, we'll have to change that.

[05:16:09:02]
LMP: Okay. I'm using a [glossary:P27] here. Go ahead.

[05:16:09:06]
CC:  Okay. The pad reads as follows and then I'll repeat
     the angles for you, so you can copy them.
     The following [glossary:MCC]-7, maneuver the [glossary:LM] to the
     following [glossary:FDAI] attitudes: roll, 000; pitch, 91.3;
     yaw, 000. Now do you want those attitudes repeated, Fred?

[05:16:09:40]
LMP: Okay. Following [glossary:MCC]-7 we're to maneuver to the
     following attitudes: roll, 000; pitch, 091.3;
     yaw, 000.

[05:16:09:54]
CC:  Okay. That's correct. And the last part of the
     pad is at [glossary:GET] [time:05:18:10:00|138:10:00], which is [glossary:EI] minus 4.5 hours,
     execute a push of 0.5 feet per second, four jet,
     plus-X; perform [glossary:SM] SEP; then execute pull, 0.5 feet
     per second, four jet, minus-X. Over.

[05:16:10:45]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius. Jack's entering the command
     module, now.

[05:16:10:48]
_page : 717
_tape : Tape 91/4
CC: Okay, Jim.

[05:16:11:14]
LMP: Okay. That last Joe was execute at the [glossary:GET] at
     [time:05:18:10:00|138:10:00] which is [glossary:EI] minus 4-1/2 hours; execute
     a push of 0.5 feet per second, four-jet ullage;
     then execute [glossary:SM] SEP followed by a pull of 0.5 feet
     per second, with respect to a nomenclature on the
     [glossary:TTCA]; I think we really need an up of 0.5 and then
     a down of 0.5.

[05:16:11:47]
CC:  That's correct, Fred.

[05:16:12:02]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius. The last pad I had for you right
     now is the [glossary:LM] jettison pad. Similar to the -
     Stand by 1, Aquarius.

[05:16:12:22]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius; Houston. Request [glossary:P00] and DATA for
     a data load. Over.

[05:16:12:28]
LMP: You got it.

[05:16:12:30]
CC:  Okay. And I was about to say the [glossary:LM] jettison pad
     is similar to the [glossary:SM] SEP pad, Fred, when you're
     ready to copy.

[05:16:12:42]
LMP: Just about the same number of lines?

[05:16:12:44]
CC:  Yes.

[05:16:13:09]
LMP: Okay. Go ahead, Joe.

[05:16:13:11]
CC:  Okay, Fred. Prior to [time:05:21:40:00|141:40:00], which is [glossary:EI] minus 1
     hour, maneuver the [glossary:LM] to the following [glossary:FDAI] angles:
     roll, 130; pitch, 125; yaw, 012.4. The corresponding
     [glossary:CSM] gimbal angles will be roll, 291; pitch,
     196; yaw, 045, and that's the pad. Over. And the
     computer is yours, Aquarius.

[05:16:13:14]
CDR: Thank you.

[05:16:14:23]
LMP: Okay. A [glossary:LM] SEP pad prior to [time:05:21:40:00|141:40:00], [glossary:EI] minus
     1 hour, maneuver to following attitudes: roll,
     130; pitch, 125; yaw, 012.4. The corresponding
     [glossary:CSM] gimbal angles are roll, 291; pitch, 196;
     yaw, 045.

[05:16:14:49]
CC:  Readback correct.

[05:16:15:57]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:16:16:01]
_page : 718
_tape : Tape 91/5
LMP: Go ahead, Joe.

[05:16:16:02]
CC:  Okay. We're so efficient down here that we got an
     entry pad ready, Fred. Do you want to copy that
     for Jack? Over.

[05:16:16:10]
LMP: Stand by. I'll have to try to borrow his book
     from him.

[05:16:16:14]
CC:  Roger.

[05:16:16:17]
CDR: Can we hold off on that a little bit, Joe?

[05:16:16:19]
CC:  Oh, absolutely, Jim. We're well ahead. I just
     wanted to let you know that we had it.

[05:16:16:25]
CDR: Okay. I hope that when you send up all those
     uplinks to Jack that you could get them up to
     him quick]y.

[05:16:16:33]
CC:  We're shooting for less than 5 minutes.

[05:16:16:38]
CDR: Sounds good.

[05:16:16:43]
LMP: And are you still using the computer?

[05:16:16:46]
CC:  That's a negative, Fred. The computer is yours.

[05:16:16:58]
CC:  And, Fred, the computer has your target load in.

[05:16:17:04]
LMP: Okay.

[05:16:18:56]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[05:16:18:59]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[05:16:19:01]
CDR: Okay. I just want to clarify one thing on the
     [glossary:LM|LM] SEP pad. It appears to me that in my configuration, I could probably use a [glossary:VERB 49] loading in
     622, yaw, pitch, and roll, in that order; and then
     being able to fly out at 5018 in roll, pitch, and
     yaw. Is that correct?

[05:16:19:24]
CC:  Stand by; I'll verify it, Jim.

[05:16:19:29]
CMP: Okay, Joe. And while you're doing that I've got
     a question about the command module checklist.

[05:16:19:32]
CC:  Okay, Jack. Go ahead with your question.

[05:16:19:37]
CMP: Okay. Either I copied the circuit breaker wrong,
     or - I can't read it. Comes down just about the -
     oh, about the 20th one down, after panel 276,
     where it says CB INSTRUMENTATION POWER CONTROL 3
     and 4, open. The next circuit breaker on panel 5 - I - Would you
     give that to me again?

[05:16:20:03]
_page : 719
_tape : Tape 91/6
CC:  Roger. That's CB ESSENTIAL INSTRUMENTATION POWER,
     MAIN B. Over. And it's, closed.

[05:16:20:16]
CMP: Okay. I just can't, right - I just can't read
     my writing, ESSENTIAL INSTRUMENTATION POWER MAIN B,
     closed.

[05:16:20:20]
CC:  That's affirmative.

[05:16:21:39]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:16:21:45]
LMP: Go ahead, Joe.

[05:16:21:46]
CC:  Roger. The word we have is that you can't make
     a [glossary:VERB 49] maneuver to the [glossary:LM|LM] jettison attitude
     because those are [glossary:FDAI|FDAI] angles we gave you, they
     don't correspond to the gimbal angles for the
     load; it'll have to be a manual maneuver. Over.

[05:16:22:05]
LMP: Okay.

[05:16:22:06]
CC:  And mind out for gimbal lock.

[05:16:22:12]
LMP: We will.

[05:16:42:01]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:16:42:05]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[05:16:42:07]
CC:  Roger. We're looking at [glossary:LM|LM] current, to see if
     Jack has started his preheat, and we haven't seen
     it yet. Is he doing okay down there?

[05:16:42:24]
CDR: Houston, Jack said he's already started it, and
     he said that in 1 more minute, he'll be up to
     20 minutes.

[05:16:42:31]
CC:  Oh. Roger that.

[05:16:42:42]
CC:  Jim, Houston. Have him let us know what his test
     meter reads when he's done.

[05:16:42:51]
CDR: He says that he had a battery A voltage drop of
     2 volts, and he'll try to look at the test meter
     for you right now.

[05:16:42:55]
_page : 720
_tape : Tape 91/7
CC: Okay.

[05:16:42:58]
CDR: He's been looking at them, but they haven't been
     coming up, so far.

[05:16:43:02]
CC:  We copy.

[05:16:43:23]
CDR: Do you see a current now, Houston?

[05:16:43:28]
CC: Stand by 1 on that, Jim. That's affirmative, Jim;
     it looks like we are seeing one now.

[05:16:43:43]
CDR: Okay. And thanks for keeping us on it.

[05:16:43:51]
CC:  Okay.

[05:16:46:43]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:16:46:46]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:16:46:47]
CC:  Roger. Reminder [glossary:P41|P41] for the [glossary:RCS|RCS] burn.

[05:16:46:54]
CDR: Thanks for keeping us honest.

[05:16:46:57]
CC:  We got to protect our jobs, Jim.

[05:16:47:09]
CDR: We've been [glossary:DPS]-ing so long here.

[05:16:47:12]
CC:  Yes.

[05:16:54:30]
CDR: Okay, Houston. I finished up the maneuvers, the
     AUTO maneuver in 41, but only roll and yaw needles
     seem to be offset. Pitch is okay.

[05:16:54:41]
CC:  Okay, Jim. We copy. Stand by. Aquarius, Houston.
     We recommend [glossary:PGNS|PGNS] MODE CONTROL to ATT HOLD. Save
     a little gas and stand by on the error needles.

[05:16:55:01]
CDR: Okay.

[05:17:04:39]
LMP: Houston, Aquarius.

[05:17:04:53]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Did you call?

[05:17:04:57]
LMP: Roger, Joe. Figured, if we're going to do this
     burn in [glossary:PGNS|PGNS] now, I ought to give you an update
     on the contingency book pages 32, 33, and 34, because the last time we went through this portion,
     we were burning it in ACS.

[05:17:05:22]
_page : 721
_tape : Tape 91/8
CC: Okay, Fred. Stand by. We've been talking about possibly having you do it in
     ACS. We recommend at this time that you do an ACS to [glossary:PGNS|PGNS] aline, the 400 plus 3 procedure only. Over.

[05:17:05:44]
LMP: Okay.

[05:17:06:19]
CC:  And, Aquarius, Houston

[05:17:06:23]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[05:17:06:24]
CC:  Roger. We recommend that you perform this burn
     in [glossary:AGS|AGS], as you did the last midcourse manuever;
     we think it will save gas. Over.

[05:17:06:36]
CDR: Okay. Joe, do you want me to line up the same
     way we did the last one, too?

[05:17:06:42]
CC:  Stand by on that.

[05:17:06:57]
LMP: And, Joe, Jack just handed me some injector 
     temperatures, if you want to read these on ... so I can
     plug them in.

[05:17:07:05]
CC:  Roger. Go ahead with those.

[05:17:07:07]
LMP: Okay. 5 Charlie, 14.0; 5 Dogs, 3.7; 6 Able, 3.5;
     6 Bravo, 4.1; 6 Charlie, 4.2; 6 Delta, 3.8.

[05:17:07:21]
CC:  Okay. Copy those, Fred.

[05:17:09:09]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:17:09:11]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[05:17:09:13]
CC:  Okay, Jim. Our recommendation on this burn is that
     you maneuver to the burn attitude, in [glossary:PGNS] MIN
     IMPULSE, then do a body-axis aline, 400 plus 5,
     followed by 400 plus 0, and then do the burn in
     [glossary:AGS]. Over.

[05:17:09:34]
CDR: Okay. Now we're spinning it with the [glossary:PGNS], what
     you gave us for a [glossary:PGNS] attitude. Is this the wrong
     one? Do you want me to just to aline up the Earth
     as I did before in the last midcourse?

[05:17:09:46]
CC:  No. We don't want you to do that. Read me your
     [glossary:FDAI] angles, and let's compare them with what
     we have down here.

[05:17:09:55]
_page : 722
_tape : Tape 91/9
CDR: Okay. You're looking at them in the [glossary:DSKY]. I've
     got roll of 8.47; pitch of about 0.51; and yaw
     looking at about 3.750.

[05:17:10:18]
CC:  Okay, Jim. Those are very close - I guess all you
     need to do is trim them up a bit.

[05:17:10:26]
CDR: I plan to do a final trim - AUTO trim, and then
     a four-jet translation.

[05:17:10:40]
CC:  Okay, Jim. For fuel conservation, we'd prefer
     you to trim it up MIN IMPULSE, and there's really
     very little trim required; and then go ahead and
     do it [glossary:AGS]. We're on the expected fuel usage, but
     we're just being old ladies about it.

[05:17:10:58]
CDR: Okay. Understand. My only question, Joe, is the
     fact that both the roll and the yaw needles did
     not go to null when I did an AUTO maneuver. I'd
     tried to go manually to the attitude; and then
     went to AUTO, but the roll and the yaw do not
     come in at all.

[05:17:11:14]
CC:  Roger. I haven't got an answer on that yet, but
     your attitude looks very close.

[05:17:11:20]
CDR: Okay. I can take it on ...

[05:17:12:45]
CDR: And, Houston, Aquarius. I'm not sure that if I
     follow and null the needles, that will be the
     proper attitude.

[05:17:13:02]
CC:  Okay. Stand by 1, Jim. We're talking about it.
     It's going to be very close; in any event, close
     enough.

[05:17:13:10]
CDR: Okay.

[05:17:13:16]
CC:  And, Jim, just for your information, I have the
     entry pad. I have the landing area weather
     summary, which you probably don't even have to
     copy, but which I'll read up to you when you're
     ready; and some stars for Jack that I'm holding
     for him for later on.

[05:17:13:31]
CDR: Okay.

[05:17:13:42]
LMP: And, Joe, Jack says all the injector temperatures,
     he just checked them again, and they're all over
     3.9 - -

[05:17:13:50]
_page : 723
_tape : Tape 91/10
CC:  That they're all over 3.9 now. Thanks a lot.

[05:17:13:58]
CC:  You can tell him that it's looking good to us.
     They were even happy with the previous ones.

[05:17:14:05]
LMP: Okay.

[05:17:15:02]
CDR: And, my only question, Houston, is do you want me
     to null the [glossary:PGNS] needle manually?

[05:17:15:08]
CC:  Okay. Stand by 1 more minute, Jim.

[05:17:16:47]
LMP: Houston, Aquarius.

[05:17:16:49]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[05:17:16:51]
LMP: Yes. I guess the basic question is comparing the
     balls here and out the window it doesn't look
     too unreasonable, and I guess Jim says the [glossary:COAS]
     is yawed and roll slightly off from what he might
     eyeball; but yet, the [glossary:FDAI] air needles for [glossary:PGNS]
     are showing a full scale left in roll and full
     scale left in yaw. ...

[05:17:17:17]
CC:  Okay. Go ahead.

[05:17:17:23]
LMP: Yes. It appears if we track those we, obviously,
     aren't going to be on the attitude that we burned
     the last midcourse.

[05:17:17:30]
CC:  Okay. Well, this attitude we passed you is not
     quite alined to the terminator, and stand by on
     this.

[05:17:17:39]
_extra : END OF TAPE
CC:  It should be off about 8 degrees, FLIGHT.

CDR: How you doing there, Houston?

[05:17:20:37]
CC:  Oh, we're getting there, Jim. We're - we're all
     agreed that you're almost, but not quite, in the
     proper attitude, and we're just trying to get
     you one firm recommendation on how to proceed
     from here.

[05:17:20:48]
CDR: Okay. I have nulled the null - roll needle and
     the pitch needle now and I'm yawed - rolled left
     now. I'm rolled left about 9 degrees.

[05:17:20:59]
CC:  Okay. Understand the needles are nulled.

[05:17:21:03]
CDR: The yaw isn't, but the pitch and roll are.

[05:17:21:07]
CC:  Roger that.

[05:17:23:50]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:17:23:52]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:17:23:53]
CC:  Okay. Here's the big story. Your attitude
     really looks quite good except in roll, and we'd
     like you to do the following. In MIN impulse
     [glossary:PGNS], we'd like you to trim to zero pitch, which
     is about where you are now; to 008 degrees in
     roll, which is about 16 degrees from your present roll attitude; and to zero degrees in yaw,
     which is about where you are now. Then we'd
     like you to do the body-axis aline 400 plus 5,
     400 plus 0. PITCH and ROLL to PULSE, select
     [glossary:AGS], do the burn in [glossary:AGS]. How does that sound?
     Over.

[05:17:24:33]
CDR: Okay. I'm rolled the wrong way; that is what
     you're saying, right?

[05:17:24:37]
CC:  That's right.

[05:17:24:49]
CDR: And you know I can't roll in minimum impulse.
     I've got to use [glossary:TTCA|TTCAs].

[05:17:24:56]
CC:  That's right, Jim. Sorry.

[05:17:26:26]
CDR: And you don't want me to automatically trim 5018,
     I take it.

[05:17:26:42]
_page : 725
_tape : Tape 92/2
CC:  That's affirm, Jim. Don't trim 5018.

[05:17:26:46]
CDR: Okay.

[05:17:26:53]
CC:  We just want you to cycle on through [glossary:P41] to get
     the average g and burn it out.

[05:17:27:00]
CDR: Okay.

[05:17:27:51]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:17:27:53]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:17:27:54]
CC:  Just for your information, we see 3.0 in register 1. We read you up 3.1 on the pad. The
     actual DELTA-V was 3.05, and they warned me that
     it might come out 3.0.

[05:17:28:11]
CDR: Okay. That's a little burn.

[05:17:28:13]
CC:  Right.

[05:17:29:36]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Your attitude looks real
     good. We will give you a mark at 10 minutes to
     the burn, which is in 28 seconds.

[05:17:29:46]
CDR: Okay. We'll burn it in [glossary:AGS] and use the [glossary:AGS] ball.

[05:17:29:54]
CC:  Right. I was looking at the wrong clock, and
     we're a little under 10 minutes now. I'll give
     you a mark at 9 minutes. Okay?

[05:17:30:05]
CDR: That's fine.

[05:17:30:36]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. We have 10 seconds until
     9 minutes to the burn. 3, 2, 1 -

[05:17:30:49]
CC:  MARK.

[05:17:30:50]
CC:  Nine minutes.

[05:17:30:53]
CDR: Very well. That agrees with our event timer.

[05:17:30:56]
CC:  Okay.

[05:17:36:57]
CDR: Okay, Houston. About 3 minutes to go, and we're
     all squared away.

[05:17:37:14]
CC:  And, Aquarius; Houston. Roger that. And we're
     standing by for your body-axis aline and your
     zeroing 404, 405, 406, going to 470.

[05:17:37:27]
_page : 726
_tape : Tape 92/3
LMP: Okay. You'd asked - you'd asked me before, Joe,
     to go 400 plus 3, which I did. I assume you've
     changed the script again.

[05:17:38:08]
CC:  Okay, Fred. We did tell you to do that awhile
     ago, and it doesn't matter; you're looking good.

[05:17:38:15]
LMP: Okay.

[05:17:39:50]
LMP: Yes. It looks like we had a minus 0.2 bias at
     470. We're burning.

[05:17:39:54]
CC:  Copy that, Fred.

[05:17:40:24]
CC:  Good show, Aquarius.

[05:17:40:29]
CDR: We're tweaking now, Joe.

[05:17:40:31]
CC:  Roger. Aquarius, Houston. You're good right
     where you are.

[05:17:40:40]
CDR: Okay. That's it.

[05:17:40:49]
LMP: Okay. If you're happy, can we maneuver to service
     module SEP attitude now?

[05:17:40:57]
CC:  That's affirmative, Aquarius.

[05:17:41:19]
CDR: And I'm pitching up to the proper attitude.

[05:17:41:23]
CC:  Okay. We're looking at it.

[05:17:41:26]
CDR: And it's again necessary to use the [glossary:TTCA] to pitch.

[05:17:41:30]
CC:  Okay. Affirmative.

[05:17:43:55]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:17:43:58]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[05:17:43:59]
CC:  Okay. Recommend you terminate [glossary:P41].

[05:17:44:08]
CDR: Okay.

[05:17:47:38]
F: Hey, Jim, have you broken into the medical kit
     per my recommendation a few hours ago?

[05:17:47:46]
CDR: Yes. Everything is taken care of Deke.

[05:17:47:49]
F: Okay, fine. You might hit it again in about
     2 hours.

[05:17:47:55]
_page : 727
_tape : Tape 92/4
CDR: Okay.

[05:17:50:37]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. AFT OMNI.

[05:17:50:41]
CDR: I beat you to it, Houston.

[05:17:50:43]
CC:  Yes. I thought you did, but I thought I'd say
     it anyway.

[05:17:55:52]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius; Houston. That attitude looks
     pretty good. How's Jack getting along?

[05:17:55:58]
CDR: He's getting along, all set to go. And I'm going
     to go into [glossary:PGNS] ATT HOLD.

[05:17:56:02]
CC:  Roger.

[05:17:57:06]
CC: Aquarius, Houston.

[05:17:57:10]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:17:57:11]
CC:  Roger. Again for fuel-consumption reasons, we'd
     like you to go back to the [glossary:AGS] mode you were in
     rather than [glossary:PGNS] ATT HOLD. Over.

[05:17:57:20]
CDR: Okay. I'm in [glossary:PGNS] MINIMUM IMPULSE right now
     while we're firing. And I'll go back to the
     [glossary:AGS] mode.

[05:17:57:31]
CC: Okay, Jim. [glossary:PGNS] MIN IMPULSE is okay; [glossary:AGS] is
     okay too. It's your choice.

[05:17:57:37]
CDR: Soon as we get rid of the service module, Joe,
     I think I'll be able to maneuver a lot better.

[05:17:57:42]
CC:  Sure thing.

[05:17:57:48]
CDR: Okay, Jack just reported that all thrusters fired
     on both rings.

[05:17:57:53]
CC:  Real fine. Real fine.

[05:17:58:32]
CDR: And [glossary:SM] JETT at [time:05:18:12:00|138:12].

[05:17:58:43]
CC:  Roger. Understand; that's [glossary:SM] JETT, [time:05:18:12:00|138:12]. It's
     not that time critical, Jim.

[05:17:58:52]
CDR: Can we do it at any time, Joe?

[05:17:58:55]
_page : 728
_tape : Tape 92/5
CC: I think so, but let me check. Aquarius, Houston.
     That's affirmative. You can jettison the service
     module when you are ready; no big rush, but any
     time.

[05:17:59:14]
CDR: Okay. Sounds good.

[05:18:00:41]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:18:00:44]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:18:00:45]
CC: Roger. We recommend that you use the [glossary:AGS] for
     the separation maneuver, because we'd like to
     get the proper weight in for the [glossary:DAP] before we
     use the [glossary:PGNS] again.

[05:18:00:59]
CDR: Roger. We will. Stand by.

[05:18:02:06]
CDR: [glossary:SM] SEP.

[05:18:02:09]
CC:  Copy that.

[05:18:03:53]
CDR: Do you see it, Jack?

[05:18:04:26]
CC: Okay, Aquarius; Houston. I recommend you terminate AVERAGE G. Over.

[05:18:04:33]
CDR: Okay, I've got her, Houston.

[05:18:04:36]
CC: Beautiful, beautiful. And for you information,
     Jim, you'll be coming up on an [glossary:RCS] caution light
     for helium. No sweat. Over.

[05:18:04:46]
CDR: And there's one whole side of that spacecraft missing.

[05:18:04:50]
CC: Is that right?

[05:18:04:57]
CDR: Right by the - Look out there, will you? Right
     by the high gain antenna, the whole panel is
     blown out, almost from the base to the engine.

[05:18:05:09]
CC:  Copy that.

[05:18:05:22]
LMP: Yes, it looks like it got to the [glossary:SPS] bell, too,
     Houston.

[05:18:05:28]
CC:  Think it zinged the [glossary:SPS] engine bell, huh?

[05:18:05:31]
_page : 729
_tape : Tape 92/6
LMP: That's the way it looks; unless that's just a
     dark brown streak. It's really a mess.

[05:18:05:51]
CC:  Okay, Jim. We'd like you to get some pictures,
     but we want you to conserve [glossary:RCS]. Don't make
     unnecessary maneuvers.

[05:18:06:08]
CC:  And, Jim; Houston. In particular, of course, we
     don't want any translation maneuvers.

[05:18:06:16]
CDR: Right on that. Joe, you realize that when I went
     up to the [glossary:SM] SEP attitude, I had to use [glossary:TTCA] to
     do it.

[05:18:06:25]
CC:  That's affirm. We know that. That's okay.

[05:18:06:50]
CDR: All right. She's drifting right down in front
     of our windows now, Houston.

[05:18:06:55]
CC:  Okay.

[05:18:08:12]
LMP: Okay, Joe, I'm now looking down the [glossary:SPS] bell, and
     it looks - looks okay on the inside; maybe it is
     just a streak.

[05:18:08:19]
CC:  Okay. Copy that, Fred. Was the bell deformed
     on the outside or just nicked or what?

[05:18:08:33]
CDR: I think the explosion, from what I could see,
     Joe, had - had stained it. I don't know whether
     it did any actual deformation or not.

[05:18:08:41]
CC:  Okay.

[05:18:09:09]
LMP: Man, that's unbelievable!

[05:18:09:38]
CDR: And, Joe, looks like a lot of - a lot of debris
     is just hanging out the side near the S-band
     antenna.

[05:18:09:47]
CC:  Roger, Jim.

[05:18:10:43]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:18:10:46]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:18:10:47]
CC:  I know you're busy, but when Jack gets a chance,
     we'd like BAT C current and MAIN A voltage in the
     command module.

[05:18:12:19]
_page : 730
_tape : Tape 92/7
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[05:18:12:21]
CC: Go ahead, Aquarius.

[05:18:12:23]
CDR: Okay. I've pitched up to about 180 degrees now,
     and do you want me to go to the [glossary:LM] SEP attitude
     for his alinement?

[05:18:12:30]
CC:  Stand by on that, Jim.

[05:18:12:46]
CC: Aquarius, Houston.

[05:18:12:48]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:18:12:49]
CC: Roger. We want you to go to the service module
     SEP attitude.

[05:18:12:54]
CDR: Okay.

[05:18:12:58]
CC:  And, Jim, when you have leisure to copy, I have
     your [glossary:NOUN 46] and [glossary:NOUN 47] [glossary:DAP] data load numbers.

[05:18:13:08]
CDR: Okay. Go ahead.

[05:18:13:10]
CC:  Okay. NOUN 46, 31021; [glossary:NOUN 47], plus 25248 and
     plus 09050. Over.

[05:18:13:33]
CDR: Roger; 31021, plus 25248, plus 09050.

[05:18:13:40]
CC: That's correct.

[05:18:14:27]
CDR: And now, Houston, do you still think that [glossary:AGS]
     is going to be less expensive than [glossary:PGNS] mode?

[05:18:14:33]
CC: That's affirmative, Jim.

[05:18:14:36]
CDR: Okay. I'm in [glossary:AGS] pulse right now. It's the ...

[05:18:14:40]
CC:  Okay. We concur.

[05:18:14:48]
CDR: Going back to [glossary:LM] SEP attitude - or [glossary:CSM] SEP
     attitude.

[05:18:14:53]

     it. Stand by 1.

[05:18:17:09]

     ENTER; 06, ENTER again. Over.

[05:18:17:17]

     SEP attitude.

[05:18:19:00]

     whether Jack got any pictures out of window 5?
     Was it still fogged up? Over.

[05:18:19:09]
CDR: I don't think so. I think he came right down
     here, because I think he saw it first in the -
     in the [glossary:LM].

[05:18:19:15]

     up, we got the entry pad and the landing area
     summary for you.

[05:18:19:36]

CMP: Okay. Doing a [glossary:VERB 37], ENTER; 06, ENTER does
     bring up the three balls 62 display, but I can't
     PROCEED on it on either [glossary:DSKY] and a [glossary:VERB 33]

CC:  Jack, Houston. How long did you hold PROCEED
     before you quit on it?

[05:18:20:49]
CMP: Well, it was varying lengths. Is it suppose to
     be a long-time PROCEED?

[05:18:20:56]
CC: We think it may be, Jack. We think it may be
     15 to 20 seconds, and our recommendation is that
     you PRO and hold it down for a good period of
     time, probably half a minute or more, and see
     if the [glossary:DSKY] blanks.

[05:18:21:11]

     Maybe 2 or 3 seconds is the longest I held it.

[05:18:21:15]

     said the computer's okay.

     that BAT C MAIN A reading for us?

[05:18:22:05]

[05:18:23:30]
_page : 733
_tape : Tape 92/10
CC: Okay. We'd like to have Jack verify that the
     PYROs in LOGIC are SAFE, and we'd like to remind
     him to do no further powerup of the [glossary:CSM] until
     [glossary:EI] minus 2 plus 30.

[05:18:23:44]
CDR: Roger. He reports that the PYROs are SAFE, and
     we're standing by for 02:30.

[05:18:23:48]

[05:18:24:06]
CDR: Well, I can't say that this week hasn't been
     filled with excitement.

[05:18:24:12]
CC:  Well, James, if you can't take any better care
     of a spacecraft than that, we might not give
     you another one. Hey, Jim; Houston. You might
     ask Jack, while he's down there, to take a peek
     through the telescope and tell us whether he
     can see any stars. Over.

[05:18:24:34]
CDR: Okay.

[05:18:26:20]
CDR: Joe, Jack tells me that there's still a lot of
     particles floating around and he's - he can't
     pick out any constellation that he recognizes
     so far. But it might clear here in a little
     while.

[05:18:26:30]
CC:  Okay, understand.

[05:18:30:56]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[05:18:30:59]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:18:31:00]
CC:  Okay. [glossary:EECOM] is looking at that battery amperage
     that you gave us awhile ago. He'd like to see
     it about a half an amp to an amp lower. Like
     you to ask Jack to just check the circuit breakers
     and switches that he's pulled in so far and make
     sure he doesn't have any extra loads on MAIN A;
     specifically, the FLOODLIGHT configuration, and
     his CAUTION AND WARNING circuit breakers, and
     his ESSENTIAL INSTRUMENTATION POWER circuit
     breakers. Over.

[05:18:31:35]

[05:18:31:37]
CC: Thanks.

[05:18:34:39]
_page : 734

CDR: Okay. Jack reported that he turned out all the
     floodlights.

[05:18:34:45]
CC: Okay. Okay, we copy that. Like to have him
     check the amperage on there; see what you have
     now, and give us a voltage reading, too.

[05:18:35:05]
CDR: Okay, will do.

[05:18:35:33]
CMP: Okay, Joe. This is Jack.

[05:18:35:35]
CC:  Go ahead.

[05:18:35:37]
CMP: Okay. I've been not reading any voltage at all
     on BAT C, and the amperage looks like about
     2 amps, but that could be kind of noise-level
     stuff. I've got all the floodlights off and I -
     Can you think of anything - I could power down
     to lower MAIN A.

[05:18:35:53]
CC:  Okay. How about reading the voltage off of
     MAIN A?

[05:18:35:57]
CMP: Okay. Oh, this is Ken. Okay. Ken, it was 30.2.

[05:18:36:03]
CC: Okay. We're checking out the floodlights we
     gave you. Actually, Jack, you ought to be able
     to go ahead and use the lights we gave you.
     There's no reason to sit in the dark. They're
     supposed to be coming off of MAIN B, and we're
     checking that now.

[05:18:36:19]
CMP: Okay. It's not bad down there. We're in - got
     plenty of light. But should I be reading the
     voltage on BAT C?

[05:18:36:39]
CC:  Jack, you should be reading BAT C voltage. That
     circuit breaker should be open.

[05:18:36:46]
CMP: Okay. Okay, can you think of anything else you
     want to get turned off to lighten load on MAIN A?

[05:18:37:01]
CC:  Okay. We're perusing that subject right now,
     Jack. It's really not that big a thing, just
     something we wanted to dress up.

[05:18:37:11]
CMP: Okay.

[05:18:37:57]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius; Houston.

[05:18:38:00]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:18:38:02]
_page : 735
_tape : Tape 92/12
CC:  Say, Jim, as something to try, you might have
     Jack turn off the RING 1's AUTO coils, which
     are probably on MAIN A. Have him turn those
     off and take a look at the readings.

[05:18:38:13]
CDR: Okay.

[05:18:39:11]
CDR: Okay. Jack has turned off RING 1 that was on
     MAIN A, and he's still reading 30.2 volts.

[05:18:39:19]
CC:  Roger that, Jim. What's his amperage? Did he
     read that off?

[05:18:39:29]
CDR: I guess. He says it's down in the mud; it's
     less than 2 amps.

[05:18:39:32]
CC:  Down in the mud. Okay, understand that. Request
     he turn them back on and - Okay, Jim, that's the
     AUTO coils back on RING 1, MAIN A, and when you
     get that done, I'd like you to copy the entry
     pad.

[05:18:40:25]
CDR: Okay, Joe. Standing by to copy the entry pad.

[05:18:40:29]
CC:  Okay, here we come. Entry pad: Mid-Pacific,
     000153; 000. The next two lines will be the
     [glossary:GET] of moonset and the Moon-check attitude;
     [time:05:22:38:17|142:38:17], 178; NOUN 61, minus 21.66, minus
     165.37; 06.7; 36211, 6.51; 1168.9, 36292;
     [time:05:22:40:40|142:40:40]; 00:28. The next four are N/A;
     D<sub>O</sub> is 4.00, 02:04; 00:17, 03:22, 08:14;
     33, 353.1, 29.9. Boresight star is Sigma
     Libra, down 08.8, left 0.4; lift vector up.
     Comments: [glossary:GDC] for entry alinement, stars 31
     and 23. The roll aline 041, pitch 245, yaw 024,
     use [glossary:EMS] nonexit pattern. Maintain Moon-check
     attitude until moonset; then go to entry attitude or track horizon with the 36-degree window
     mark. Last comment: constant g entry is roll
     right. Over.

[05:18:43:46]
CDR: Entry pad as follows: Mid-PAC, 000153, 000;
     [time:05:22:38:17|142:38:17], 178; minus 21.66, minus 165.37;
     06.7; 36211, 6.51; 1168.9, 36292; [time:05:22:40:40|142:40:40];
     00:28. Next four columns are N/A; D<sub>O</sub> is 4.00,
     02:04; 00:17, 03:22 08:14; 33, 353.1, 29.9.
     Zebra Libra, or something like that, Beta Libra
     is down 08.8, left 0.4; lift vector up; [glossary:GDC]
     entry alined, stars 31, 33. Roll 041, pitch,
     045, yaw 024. [glossary:EMS] nonexit pattern to be used;
     maintain Moon-check attitude until moonset.
     and if all else is lost, the constant g entry
     is right - Roll is right.

[05:18:45:08]
_page : 736
_tape : Tape 92/13
CC:  Okay. Roger that, Jim. I want to verify a
     couple of things I'm not sure I heard you
     read back. The first one was Zebra Libra
     (laughter) that's Sigma Libra. The set
     stars 31 and 23. Did you get that? Over.

[05:18:45:27]
CDR: Okay. No, I had 31 and 33, and I got Sigma
     Libra now, and it'll be 31 and 23 for the
     set stars.

[05:18:45:34]
CC:  Okay. And your [glossary:GDC] pitch aline, I wasn't
     sure whether that was - whether you read
     back 245 or 045. The correct number is 245.
     Over.

[05:18:45:45]
CDR: Good show, because I have 045 down. 245.

[05:18:45:48]
CC:  Okay. And the Moon check here, unlike the
     horizon check, is on the 36-degree window
     mark all the way. Just wanted to repeat
     that.

[05:18:46:08]
CDR: Moon check on 30-degree window mark.

[05:18:46:11]
CC:  That's 36-degree window mark, Jim.

[05:18:46:14]
CDR: Three six. Roger.

[05:18:46:16]
CC:  Okay. Readback correct. And, Aquarius; Houston.
     If you want me to read you the landing area
     summary, I'll do that.

[05:18:46:31]
CDR: Sounds good.

[05:18:46:33]
CC:  Okay. In the mid-Pacific landing area, the
     weather is good. The cloud cover is 2000,
     scattered; visibility, 10; winds 060 at 10;
     wave heights are 4 feet, and the altimeter
     2986, if you care. Scattered showers less
     than 10 percent of the area. Recovery forces
     are as follows: the Iwo Jima will be at the
     touchdown point, the aircraft call sign will
     be Recovery 1, on station with swimmers on
     board. The - we have the constant g backup
     reentry area covered with the USS Hall, the
     Good Liberty Ship, and the other recovery
     aircraft whose call signs you may hear are
     Samoa Rescue C-130s.

[05:18:47:31]
_page : 737
_tape : Tape 92/14
CDR: Okay, fine. We have the Iwo Jima as the prime
     recovery ship.

[05:18:47:34]
CC: That's correct.

[05:18:47:37]
CDR: Joe, Jack tells me he is still having trouble
     looking through the optics. I'm just going to
     pitch up a little bit more here to see if he can
     get into the dark spot.

[05:18:47:46]
CC:  Okay, real fine. You might tell him when we get
     to that point, we have some - some stars with
     corresponding shaft and trunnion angles to pass
     to him as backups in case the computer doesn't
     happen to point him straight at one. And it's
     the Summer Triangle.

[05:18:51:16]
CDR: And are you tracking us, and do you have any
     results on that last midcourse?

[05:18:51:21]
_extra : END OF TAPE
CC:  Stand by. It looks good. I'll try and get
     you numbers.

[05:18:52:14]
_page : 738
_tape : Tape 93/1
CDR: It feels nice to use the hand controller again.

[05:18:52:19]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[05:18:52:22]
CDR: I just said, Joe, it feels nice to use the hand
     controller again.

[05:18:52:25]
CC:  Oh. Roger that. [glossary:FIDO] says he's got you nailed
     within a half a foot per second; the midcourse
     looked real good.

[05:18:52:33]
CDR: Okay.

[05:18:52:35]
CC:  And I've got two things we'd like Jack to do in
     the command module to ease the load on MAIN A.
     One of them is to verify or turn the CM/RCS
     HEATER switch to OFF. We're done with that, and
     even though the circuit breakers are pulled, the
     switches might be drawing a little current. And
     the second one is, we'd like him to turn [glossary:SCS]
     LOGIC POWER 2/3 to OFF; we don't need it now.
     It's called up in the checklist at the appropriate time, and we'd like him to turn that off.
     Over.

[05:18:53:20]
CDR: Okay. I'll tell Jack to check that the CM/RCS
     HEATER switch is off, and, if not, we'll turn
     it off; and also to turn off the [glossary:SCS] LOGIC POWER
     2/3 switch, OFF, since it comes up later in the
     checklist.

[05:18:53:34]
CC:  That's correct.

[05:18:54:14]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius. We're recording MAIN A voltage up to 31.0.

[05:18:54:19]
CC:  Roger. That's 31.0. We're smiling.

[05:18:59:10]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[05:18:59:11]
CC:  Go, Aquarius.

[05:18:59:14]
CDR: Okay. How about if I hold a pitch attitude of
     about 115 instead of about 91. I think Jack can
     use the optics a little bit better at that angle.

[05:18:59:28]
CC:  Jim, that's perfectly okay with us, if it looks
     good for stars.

[05:18:59:35]
_page : 739
_tape : Tape 93/2
CDR: He just looked at them briefly; I'll go down and
     look at them a little bit better here.

[05:18:59:41]
CC:  Okay. With the new attitude, our shaft and trunnion angles we were going to pass him don't mean
     anything, but it's more important to have a good
     star field.

[05:19:09:45]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:19:09:48]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:19:09:49]
CC:  Okay, Jim. We - We've been talking about your
     going to a different attitude than the pad attitude for better star field vision out the command
     module, and what we'd like to have you do is this.
     If you can predict now or sometime soon, what
     attitude it is that you would like to hold at
     that time, and go to that attitude now, we'd like
     to be able to compute the coarse aline gimbal
     angles for the [glossary:CSM], and we can do that if you go
     to the selected attitude, hold it, call up a
     [glossary:VERB 06] [glossary:NOUN 20], and read us your [glossary:LM] gimbal angles,
     we can take those and compute [glossary:CSM] coarse aline
     gimbal angles on the assumption that, when we get
     back into the [glossary:CSM] coarse aline, you will return
     to that selected attitude. Does that sound okay?
     Over.

[05:19:10:46]
CDR: Yes. I'll try to hold the attitude we select
     directly, while you're giving us the coarse aline
     attitude. We're not too sure what - what's the
     best attitude. I'm going to ask Jack again if
     115 is sufficient for him.

[05:19:11:02]
CC:  Okay. You can take some time figuring out the
     best attitude, and then you won't have to hold
     it all the way from now until then, if you just
     get back to it.

[05:19:12:58]
CDR: Houston, Jack would like to know what constellations are in his sextant, or scanning telescope,
     field of view at an attitude of about 105 pitch,
     zero roll, zero yaw. Can you give that to us?

[05:19:13:15]
CC:  Okay. We'll sure give it a go. As I said, we -
     We have some stars. They're not - They're not
     centered with the shaft and trunnion zero. Let
     us take a quick look at 105 pitch, shaft and
     trunnion zero, and see if we can get you an
     answer.

[05:19:13:52]
_page : 740
_tape : Tape 93/3
CC: Aquarius, Houston.

[05:19:13:55]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:19:13:56]
CC: Roger. These - None of these stars will be
     exactly centered, but, at a pitch attitude of
     115, we had computed that Vega, Altair, Rasalhague,
     and Deneb would all be in the telescope field of
     view, and the first three were also in view at
     the 91-degree pitch, so he should be able to see
     one or more of those four stars. Over.

[05:19:14:30]
CDR: Okay. Thank you, very much.

[05:19:14:33]
CC:  Okay. And, Jim, I can give shaft and trunnions
     if - if he's interested.

[05:19:14:42]
CDR: Okay. Why don't you give us the shaft and trunnion for - say, Altair at 115, and I'll go up
     there, and I'll see if he can pick it up.

[05:19:14:52]
CC:  Okay. Real fine, At 115 degrees of pitch, Altair,
     shaft 274, trunnion 22.2. Over.

[05:19:15:08]
CDR: Roger. Shaft is 274, trunnion 22.2.

[05:19:15:11]
CC:  That's affirm.

[05:19:15:44]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:19:15:47]
CDR: Go ahead, Joe.

[05:19:15:48]
CC:  Okay, Jim. In the [glossary:LM], there we have - We show
     battery 3 only drawing about an amp, and we think
     it's probably time to get it off the line; battery 3 to OFF/RESET. Over.

[05:19:16:10]
CDR: Battery 3 is OFF/RESET.

[05:19:16:12]
CC:  Okay.

[05:19:16:19]
CDR: Just how's our power consumption, Houston, just
     out of curiosity?

[05:19:16:25]
CC:  I'll verify it, Jim. I'm sure it's okay.

[05:19:16:47]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius; Houston. With the present amount
     of power you've got in the LM, which is over
     500 amp-hours, and the rate you're using them,
     we figure you've got almost 12 hours of power left.

[05:19:17:04]
_page : 741
_tape : Tape 93/4
CDR: Twelve hours, huh? We could reenter with it.

[05:19:17:06]
CC:  That's affirm.

[05:19:17:15]
CC:  That's enough for two touch-and-goes and a full
     stop, Jim.

[05:19:17:24]
CDR: That's right, Joe; if you could dig a crater like
     Cone Crater, I could might hit it.

[05:19:17:30]
CC:  (Laughter) Okay.

[05:19:17:33]
CDR: Jack reports that he thinks he can see Altair.

[05:19:17:36]
CC:  Very good.

[05:19:17:40]
CDR: He says, he thinks he can see Altair.

[05:19:17:44]
CC: Okay. I'll take back the "very," but I'll leave
     the "good."

[05:19:21:22]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[05:19:21:25]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Go.

[05:19:21:30]
CDR: I ran back there to take a look and see what I
     could see in the - in the scanning telescope.
     It looks pretty grim back there right now. It
     might be that we have to go with the coarse aline,
     and maybe computation of some fine aline docking
     angles, if we have time.

[05:19:21:46]
CC:  Okay. We'd like to do that, too. Wait a minute;
     stand by, Jim.

[05:19:23:28]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?

[05:19:23:31]
CDR: I read you loud and clear.

[05:19:23:32]
CC: Okay. What we'd like to do, Jim, is - We'll go
     ahead and get the coarse aline to the gimbal
     angles that - that you're going to be holding
     for us; and we'll get the platform up, and then
     when you call [glossary:P52] and you use PICAPAR, it probably won't be close enough to put the star in
     the sextant, but if you can see any kind of a
     bright star in the general vicinity, - and like
     general vicinity, I mean 2 to 3 degrees from the
     center of the telescope, so that you have some
     clue as to which way to go, then the identification problem shouldn't present much of a - of a
     difficulty. And once you get the thing in the
     sextant, then you can go ahead and treat it like
     any other PICAPAR.

[05:19:24:18]
_page : 742
_tape : Tape 93/5
CDR: That sounds great, Ken. One little problem:
     there's all sorts of bright objects floating
     around us, and also that just staring at part
     of Aquarius; it's just reflecting light like
     mad. We can give it a try. There's no problem
     there; if we can see it, we'll get it.

[05:19:24:38]
CC:  Okay. And in - in the event that that doesn't
     work, we're standing by with the original scheme,
     a set of [glossary:LM] [glossary:FDAI] angles to fly to that'll point
     the command module optics at the Moon and the
     Sun; so we can always go back to that.

[05:19:24:53]
CDR: Okay.

[05:19:25:10]
CC: And, Aquarius, Houston. We'd like you to verify
     the SUIT RELIEF valve to closed. Over.

[05:19:25:18]
CDR: Stand by. It's closed.

[05:19:25:25]
CC:  Okay.

[05:19:31:05]
CDR: Okay, Houston; Aquarius.

[05:19:31:07]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Go.

[05:19:31:09]
CDR: We'll go with your original 91-degree angle, if
     you have the stars figured out, and the coarse
     aline angle for it.

[05:19:31:18]
CC:  Okay. Roger that, Jim. Then at - at your convenience here, we'd like you to go to that attitude, as close as you can get, and call up a
     [glossary:NOUN 20] for us.

[05:19:31:31]
CDR: Okay. In work now.

[05:19:31:33]
CC:  Okay.

[05:19:34:58]
CDR: Houston, Aquarius.

[05:19:35:02]
CC:  Go ahead, Aquarius.

[05:19:35:05]
CDR: Okay. I take it that, if - if Jack cannot see
     stars at this attitude after you give him the
     coarse aline angles, we're just not going to
     read down to you our gimbal angles and have you
     figure out a target angle for Jack, but you want
     him to do sighting on the Moon and the Sun. Is
     that correct?

[05:19:35:26]
_page : 743
_tape : Tape 93/6
CC:  That's roughly correct, Jim. Jack will coarse
     aline at that attitude. This is what we're having you maneuver to the - to that attitude for.
     We're going to compute coarse aline gimbal angles
     and pass them up to him, and the first thing he'll
     do when he gets there, per his checklist, is to
     coarse aline his platform. Then he'll go into
     the [glossary:P52], and, if he can't see stars, we will
     quickly pass up to you the - your [glossary:FDAI] angles to
     put him in the Moon-view attitude, and he'll do
     his [glossary:P52] on the Moon, and then have you maneuver
     on the Sun and complete the [glossary:P52] of the Sun.

[05:19:36:11]
CDR: Okay. But I'm going to have to maneuver to the
     Moon to help him out.

[05:19:36:15]
CC:  Oh. That's - That's affirmative. If he can't
     see stars at the - at the SEP attitude that -
     that you'll be holding, you'll have to maneuver
     to the Moon attitude and then to the Sun attitude
     for him.

[05:19:37:26]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:19:37:29]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:19:37:30]
CC:  Just like to mention that, even if, for some
     reason, we run out of time or something and
     don't complete the Moon-Sun [glossary:P52], Jack will have
     a platform coarse aline to the entry [glossary:REFSMMAT],
     which we feel will be plenty good enough.

[05:19:37:46]
CDR: Roger. That's my feelings, too.

[05:19:37:48]
CC: Okay.

[05:19:50:45]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:19:50:49]
CDR: Hello there, Houston.

[05:19:50:50]
CC:  Hi! Jim, we - We've gone ahead and computed
     the [glossary:CSM] coarse aline gimbal angles based on your
     being at the service module SEP attitude at the
     time that Jack cranks up the computer and - and
     coarse alines the [glossary:IMU]. That is, we assume that
     you're going to be at roll, 0; pitch, 091; yaw, 0;
     and, if you concur on that, I'd like to pass up
     the angles for - for Jack to have.

[05:19:51:27]
_page : 744
_tape : Tape 93/7
CDR: Okay. I'll be there to the best of my ability.

[05:19:51:38]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:19:51:40]
CC:  Okay. [glossary:CSM] coarse aline angles: ROLL, plus
     298.95; PITCH, plus 271.30; YAW, plus 000.20.

[05:19:52:11]
CDR: Okay. The command module angles will be: ROLL,
     298.95; PITCH, 271.30; and YAW, 000.20.

[05:19:52:21]
CC:  That's affirmative, and that's for his [glossary:VERB 41]
     [glossary:NOUN 20] when he gets there.

[05:20:00:50]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[05:20:00:53]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston; Aquarius here.

[05:20:00:55]
CC:  Okay, Jim. We're getting about 9 minutes from
     the commencement of command module powerup, and
     we wanted to just mention to you for Jack's
     benefit that, although the batteries are looking
     real good, in case they're cool and have a little
     difficulty hacking the load just at first, we'd
     like him to monitor main bus voltage to 24 volts
     or above during the powerup procedure and, if it
     falls below, we'll have a couple of circuit
     breakers for him that - that will solve the problem.

[05:20:01:33]
CDR: Okay. And I take it you're also monitoring
     main bus voltage.

[05:20:01:38]
CC:  Negative. Not in the command module at this
     time, because we don't call up telemetry until
     a little bit later on.

[05:20:01:44]
CDR: Ah so. That's right; I forgot. Okay. I will
     tell him.

[05:20:01:47]

     module.

[05:20:09:56]
CDR: Right-o. We're starting now.

[05:20:09:58]
CC:  Okay.

[05:20:10:32]
LMP: Okay. We have [glossary:LM] power breakers.

[05:20:11:22]
LMP: Okay. Houston, you're looking at it.

[05:20:11:24]
CC:  Okay. Roger. Stand by.

[05:20:11:34]

CDR: OMNI Charlie. Okay. Standby.

[05:20:16:45]

     system known as yelling through the tunnel.

     power up the [glossary:CM], and I'm staying down in good
     old Aquarius.

     Can you read them?

[05:20:21:36]
CC:  Negative. Don't read Odyssey yet; has he got
     his intercom panel configured?

[05:20:21:41]
CDR: I'll doublecheck. They're hearing you.

[05:20:21:49]
CC:  Okay. Good deal. I don't hear them, yet.

[05:20:22:42]
CDR: We've got a lot of things to do, Houston.

[05:20:22:45]
CC:  I know it. Okay, Aquarius; Houston. Recommend
     in Odyssey that he switch the POWER AMPLIFIER to
     LOW. Over.

[05:20:22:54]
CDR: POWER AMPLIFIER to LOW.

[05:20:23:02]
CDR: It's been switched to LOW, Houston.

[05:20:23:05]
CC:  Roger. Okay. Verify the POWER AMP talkback is
     gray, Jim.

     bit better signal strength on another OMNI.

[05:20:25:10]
CC:  Okay. Stand by.

[05:20:25:23]
CC:  Okay, Odyssey; Houston. Select your own best
     OMNI and then repeat [glossary:VERB 74] ENTER. Over.

[05:20:26:50]

CC:  You're looking good on the ground, Odyssey.

[05:20:35:41]
LMP: Okay.

[05:20:35:45]
CC:  And I think the reason you don't read voltage is
     it's a circuit breaker that we have called as
     being out.

[05:20:35:53]
LMP: All right.

[05:20:36:56]
CC:  Odyssey, Houston. The uplink is going well. We

CMP: Is the computer mine now, Joe?

[05:20:39:13]

     to the jettison attitude.

[05:20:43:23]

[05:20:43:37]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. I copied that you - that he's

CMP: Okay, Joe. I don't have a star in the sextant.
     I'm going to hunt for it in a minute.

[05:20:48:09]
CC:  Roger that, Jack.

[05:20:49:23]
CMP: Okay, Joe. Can you give me any stars that I might
     try here?

[05:20:49:28]
CC:  That's affirmative. Vega and Altair should be
     good. Vega is 36, Altair is 40.

[05:20:49:36]
CMP: Okay. We'll give that a try.

[05:20:49:38]
CC:  Okay. And you might look for them in the telescope if they're not in the sextant right off.
     They should be close to the crosshairs.

[05:20:49:45]
CMP: Okay. I got all that material that's venting from
     the bottom of the command module.

[05:20:49:53]
CC:  Roger that.

[05:20:52:07]
CDR: I have an [glossary:RCS] light, Houston.

[05:20:52:16]

     time ago. Low helium; no sweat.

[05:20:52:22]
CDR: Oh, okay.

[05:20:52:39]
CMP: Okay, Houston. There's a star angle difference
     with stars 36 and 40.

[05:20:52:46]
CC:  How about that, baby.

[05:20:52:49]
CMP: An odd maneuver, Houston.

[05:20:52:52]
CC:  Roger that. Copy you're maneuvering to the [glossary:LM]
     JETT attitude. Is that right?

[05:20:52:58]

[05:20:52:59]

[05:20:54:06]
CMP: I am OMNI Bravo, Jim.

[05:20:54:08]
CC:  Okay.

[05:20:54:18]
CMP: Okay, Houston. The sextant star check passes.

[05:20:54:25]
CC:  Say again, Jack.

[05:20:54:28]
CMP: I did a star check, and it passes. It puts that
     star right in the telescope.

[05:20:54:35]
CC:  Good enough. You can press on in the checklist,
     Jack.

[05:20:54:56]
CC:  Find out [glossary:LM] gimbal lock, Jim.

[05:20:54:59]

     worried about.

[05:20:55:03]

[05:20:55:28]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston.

[05:20:55:30]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:20:55:31]
CC:  Roger. If you concur, we would be inclined to recommend that you go to [glossary:AGS] for the maneuver because
     you'll have to be there later on anyway.

[05:20:55:41]
CDR: Okay.

[05:20:55:43]
CC: And [glossary:AGS] PULSE is the recommendation.

[05:20:55:46]
CDR: We're having trouble maneuvering, Joe, without
     getting it in gimbal lock.

[05:20:55:50]
CC:  Okay. You can - -

[05:20:55:51]
CDR: You picked a lousy attitude, though, to separate.

[05:20:55:55]
CC:  Well, we apologize. Just take your time. Jim,
     we've got time now.

[05:20:56:01]
CDR: Okay.

[05:20:56:28]
_page : 752
_tape : Tape 94/6
CDR: Houston, why can't I stay in [glossary:PGNS] ATT HOLD for
     the [glossary:LM] attitude hold?

[05:20:56:38]
CC:  Stand by on that, Jim.

[05:20:57:34]
CC:  Aquarius, Houston. Over.

[05:20:57:36]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:20:57:38]
CC:  Okay. Our recommendation is that you stay in [glossary:AGS]
     for the [glossary:LM] JETT simply because we've thought it
     through. We've got the right deadbands and all
     set up. Over.

[05:20:57:49]
CDR: Okay. It's a lot easier for me to maneuver in
     [glossary:PGNS], Joe, than it is [glossary:AGS].

[05:20:57:56]
CC:  Yes. You can maneuver in [glossary:PGNS], Jim. I'm sorry,
     I thought you were talking about the ATT HOLD and
     the [glossary:LM] JETT afterward. You can maneuver in [glossary:PGNS]
     if you want to.

[05:20:58:22]
CDR: I want to get way over here, Joe. To prevent
     him into gimbal lock, I have the yaw at about -
     I'd say about almost 50 degrees.

[05:20:58:35]
CC:  Roger that. Just stay out of gimbal lock and
     that 45-degree isn't critical - the out of plane,
     that is.

[05:20:59:05]
CC:  Odyssey, Houston. Request OMNI Charlie.

[05:20:59:10]

[05:21:00:32]
CC:  Okay, Jim. The particular [glossary:DAP] configuration we have
     set up now is using more fuel than we'd like out

     attitude and I'm planning on bailing out.

[05:21:02:36]

[05:21:02:40]
CC:  We recommend that, Jim.

[05:21:02:54]
CC:  Okay, Aquarius; Houston. In [glossary:AGS] ATT HOLD, we
     recommend WIDE DEADBAND. Over.

[05:21:03:01]

[05:21:05:35]

[05:21:05:43]

[05:21:05:46]
CC:  That's affirm.

[05:21:05:48]
CMP: Yes, We've transferred that.

[05:21:05:50]
CC:  Okay. Good deal. Jack, let me mention something
     about the hatch integrity check. You're going to
     vent the tunnel until you get a 3-psi DELTA-P.
     That should take 9 or 10 minutes, and it's our firm
     feeling that you don't have to wait another
     10 minutes after that for a leak check. If it
     holds pressure for a minute or so or even gets
     down there, you know you've got a good hatch.
     Over.

[05:21:06:16]
CMP: Okay. Copy that.

[05:21:06:18]
CC:  Okay.

[05:21:12:42]

[05:21:12:47]

[05:21:12:53]
CMP: Well, we might be pressurizing a lot of the system
     that was not pressurized.

[05:21:12:59]

_comment : "Actually attributed to CMP/CDR"
CMP: Go ahead.

[05:21:15:19]
CC:  Okay. We're observing middle gimbal angle getting
     a little bit high. The [glossary:LM] appears to be deadbanding 
     okay within its attitude, but just wanted you
     to know that we're keeping an eye on it and if it
     does get too high, we might want you to punch off
     early.

[05:21:15:32]
CMP: Okay.

[05:21:15:36]
CC:  And verify that the hatch is secured and that you
     are venting the tunnel. Over.

[05:21:15:42]
CMP: That's verified. We have a DELTA-P of 2.8.

[05:21:15:46]
CC:  Real good. Real good.

[05:21:16:27]
CMP: Okay, Joe. Since we're ahead of the time line,
     can I proceed on and kind of punch off early, or
     do you want me to punch off at exactly 1 hour?

[05:21:16:35]
CC:  Jack, when you are comfortably ready to punch off,
     you can go ahead and do it.

[05:21:17:49]
CC:  Odyssey, Houston. We just had a formal GO for [glossary:LM]
     JETT at your convenience. Over.

[05:21:17:57]
CMP: Okay. Thanks, Joe.

[05:21:17:58]
CC:  Okay.

[05:21:18:25]
CC:  Okay, Odyssey; Houston. We're ready for you to
     bring the [glossary:BMAGs] ON and WARM UP and all other things
     being equal, we'd like you to go through the [glossary:LM]
     JETT at - on the checklist you've got. And that
     is [glossary:BMAG]s 1 - -

[05:21:18:38]
CMP: Okay. Will do.

[05:21:18:40]
CC:  - - 1. That's [glossary:BMAG] 1 now, as you know.

[05:21:18:45]
_page : 756
_tape : Tape 94/10
CMP: Yes, [glossary:BMAG] 1 is in WARM UP.

[05:21:18:47]
CMP: Okay, Houston. Do you have a command module
     weight for me?

[05:21:20:24]
CC:  Stand by 1, Jack.

[05:21:20:43]
CC:  Odyssey, Houston.

[05:21:20:47]
CMP: Go ahead.

[05:21:20:48]
CC:  Okay. I'm reminded that the entry [glossary:DAP] is all
     you've got. It'll initialize itself, and you won't
     have an - you won't have an [glossary:RCS] [glossary:DAP], so you don't
     have to fool with it.

[05:21:20:59]
CMP: Okay.

[05:21:22:12]
CMP: Okay, Joe. I'm - Have you got your checklist out
     there on the [glossary:SPS] powerup?

[05:21:22:17]
CC:  That's affirm.

[05:21:22:19]
CMP: Okay. I'm coming down here to a step that says
     [glossary:FDAI] POWER, off. Is that what you want right now,
     I guess, huh?

[05:21:22:28]
CC:  Go ahead.

[05:21:22:29]
CC:  Okay, Jack. That [glossary:FDAI] POWER, OFF, is to stop
     momentary gliches as you bring up the [glossary:BMAG] to
     put it on, and you turn right around and put the
     [glossary:FDAI] POWER right back on 1.

[05:21:22:44]
CMP: Okay. And I don't have the [glossary:BMAG] TEMP light
     out yet. Do you want me to go ahead and put
     the [glossary:BMAG] ON with the TEMP light still ON?

[05:21:22:50]
CC:  That's affirm. We can go ahead and you'll have
     a good stable rate.

[05:21:22:55]
CMP: All right. Let's do it.

[05:21:26:38]
CMP: Okay, Houston. We'll punch off at 141 plus 30.

[05:21:26:43]
CC:  Okay, Jack. We copy and we concur.

[05:21:28:21]
CMP: Okay, Houston. Do we have a GO for PYRO ARM?

[05:21:28:34]
CC:  Odyssey, Houston. We can give you a GO if you'll
     put the LOGIC ON momentarily first.

[05:21:28:41]
_page : 757
_tape : Tape 94/11
CMP: Okay. The SECs LOGIC is on.

[05:21:28:42]
CC: Okay. Just copied that, and you are GO for
     PYRO ARM.

[05:21:28:47]
CMP: Real fine.

     thank you.

[05:21:30:24]

[05:21:36:05]
CMP: Go ahead.

[05:21:36:06]
CC:  Okay, Jack. We'll have a pad for you in a few
     minutes. We're getting data now on the tracking,
     and although we suspect the changes from your
     preliminary pad will be very small, we recommend
     that you hold off on initializing the [glossary:EMS] until
     we get you the final pad. Over.

[05:21:36:23]
CMP: Okay. Will do.

[05:21:36:25]
CC:  Roger.

[05:21:37:20]

     Jack.

[05:21:37:35]
CMP: Yes. I was kind of lucky, I guess.

[05:21:37:41]
CC:  Give you a big gold star for that.

[05:21:37:44]
CMP: Thank you.

[05:21:38:15]
CMP: Hey, Joe. We're standing by to copy your new pad.

[05:21:38:18]

     to get it right up to speed.

CMP: Okay. I can proceed with [glossary:EMS] check, can't I, Joe?

[05:21:38:46]

     that.

[05:21:46:48]

[05:21:46:51]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[05:21:46:53]

     looking real good also, Jim.

[05:21:47:16]

     same; if you want me to copy them, let me know;
     otherwise, you can read back. Over.

     except lift vector which is up; and I have the

[05:21:50:51]
CC:  Okay, Jim. That's a tiny hair shallower than
     we had you before, but it's based on solid tracking, 
     and it still is lift vector up comfortably.

     look? Are you still tracking it?

[05:22:01:17]
CC: All I've heard was that it's that the cabin
     was holding pressure. I haven't heard anything
     more. And, Odyssey, we're ready for you to warm
     up the [glossary:BMAG] number 2's at your discretion and 
     we're curious whether the Moon check attitude
     is good. Over.

     45 degrees now and it's coming on down.

[05:22:09:11]
CDR: OFF, center, is done.

[05:22:09:14]
CC:  Okay. You're still looking real fat on power.
     We show you having over 30 amps on the water.
     If you do get into a bind and don't come up - 
     that's amp-hours - don't come up with Recovery,
     you can always power down and you can always
     put the pyro batteries on the line if you need
     them after you're down.

CMP: Are you planning to turn on the suit compressor
     at all on the way down?

[05:22:18:07]
CC: That's a negative Jack; I'll verify it, but I
     sure don't think so.

[05:22:18:11]
CMP: Okay. That's all right with us.

[05:22:18:22]
