[-00:01:34:00]
Dawn 1 (Rudnev): Rudnev here on the phone. Yuri Alekseyevich, how do you feel, any news there, what do you see through the windows?

_comment: original translated as portholes by Igor, but I've changed that throughout to window

_comment: Cedar: (didn't hear, was on other line)

Cedar: ... everything fine. Do you read me?

_comment: (laugh).

Dawn 1 (Popovych): Ok then, good, take care. Do you know who is talking to you?

Cedar: I know — it's [glossary:Lilies of the Valley|Lily of the Valley].

_comment: (laugh. he called astronaut Popovych P. R. "Landysh")

_comment: This is Russian for Lily of the Valley, a private joke between the cosmonauts who called each other Lilies of the Valley, after a popular song. Source: Leonov in Life, 14th May 1965, p124.

Dawn 1 (Popovych): They will talk to you now.

Cedar: Roger. I will start your task right away.




[-00:01:31:00]
Dawn 1 (Bykov): During separation move switch closer to you.

Cedar: Roger. Default position during work and on the orbit switch should be set to telegraph and [glossary:Zaria]. During separation set switch to "signal".

Dawn 1 (Popovych): Roger. Thats correct, Yuri.




[-00:01:30:00]
Dawn 1 (Popovych): Do you read me?

Cedar: I hear you well. And myself?

Dawn 1 (Popovych): I hear you well. Yuri, what are you doing right now?

Cedar: Ok, I'm not very busy at the moment.

Dawn 1 (Popovych): I've found continuation of "[glossary:Lilies of the Valley]". Got it?

_comment: "Landyshy" [Lilies of the Valley again] is a song

_comment: [The] music he listened to during the preparations for his flight could hardly evoke elevated patriotic feelings: he actually listened to Lilies of the Valley, a popular love song, whose lyrics cosmonauts parodied, turning it into a drinking song. (Soviet Space Mythologies, Slava Gerovitch 2015, chapter 1 "Why are we telling lies?")

Cedar: Got it, got it — continue.

Dawn 1 (Popovych): We will sing it tonight.

Dawn 1 (Korolev): Yuri Alekseyevich, I want to remind you that I won't give the word "seconds", but just the number approximately every fifty seconds, for example: 50, 100, 150 and so on. Is this clear?

Cedar: Roger. I expected that.

_comment: Was originally translated "I've thought so."

Dawn 1 (Korolev): Great.




[-00:01:10:00]

Dawn 1 (Korolev): Roger. Your request will be satisfied, Yuri Alekseyevich.




[-00:01:09:00]
Dawn 1 (Korolev): Yuri Alekseyevich, we have a problem: after closing the hatch one of the contacts hasn't connected well. Because of that we will unmount hatch and will setup it again. Do you read me?

Cedar: Roger. Hatch is open, checking detectors.

[-00:01:01:00]
Dawn 1 (Popovych): Are you working now on throat mike or [glossary:DEMSH]?

_comment: throat mike was translated "laryngo" -- so this is somewhat of a guess (constrasts with DEMSH, which is the "dynamic electromagnetic microphone helmet", ie a headset.

Cedar:  I'm working now on [glossary:DEMSH].

Dawn 1 (Popovych): Roger.

Dawn 1 (Kamanin): This is 50 minute readiness.

Cedar: Roger: 50 minute readiness.




[-00:00:54:00]
Dawn 1 (Korolev): Do you read me? Have they started closing the hatch?

Cedar: I hear you well. It seems that they are finishing mounting the cover.

Dawn 1 (Korolev): Roger, everything fine here.

Cedar: Everything fine here too. Feeling good, buoyant mood.

Dawn 1 (Korolev): Thats wonderful. Moscow just asked about your mood and how are you doing there. We replied that everything is fine.

[-00:00:53:00]
Dawn 1 (Popovych): Yuri, are you bored there?

Cedar: Would be nice to play music, if this is possible

Dawn 1 (Popovych): One minute.




[-00:00:52:00]
Dawn 1 (Korolev): You probably should here noise right now. That's because they are lowering catwalks. All top works have finished. Do you read me?

Cedar: Roger: lowering catwalks, but I don't hear the noise. I feel some vibrations.

Dawn 1 (Korolev): Roger. That's fine.

Dawn 1 (Korolev): Station [glossary:Zaria] this is Zaria-1. Please complete [glossary:Cedar]'s request, play some music for him.

_comment: («Zaria» - on-ground VHF station),

[-00:00:48:00]
Dawn 1 (Korolev): It's ok, you know musicians; now they're here, now they're there, but they don't do anything very fast, as the saying goes, Yuri Alekseyevich.

_comment: Challenge to Apollo, p276 (published by the NASA History Division as NASA SP-2000-4408)

Cedar: They are playing about love.

Dawn 1 (Korolev): Playing about love? That's wise, Yuri Alekseyevich, I think so.

Dawn 1 (Popovych): Yuri, are they playing music, right?

Cedar: Flight continues, congestion is increasing, slow rotations, everything feeling fine. Through the periscope I can see the Earth: it's almost covered with clouds.

_comment: Original seems to translate as porthole "eye". "Optical device for spacecraft orientation in space", apparently. Mercury, Soyuz both described as having a periscope, so I'll call it that.

Dawn 1 (Korolev): Everything goes well. Roger, we hear you well.





[00:00:05:00]

_comment: subsequently passed out of VHF range, and so everything subsequent was via UHF to Khabarovsk.


[00:00:36:00]
Cedar: Do you read me? - -

_comment: Vesna (Kadushkin): ( didn't replied, worked to the plan)


[00:00:39:00]

_note: Khabarovsk station transmitted signal "KK" by telegraph, meaning "send control commands".

_comment: Following converted to comment as it seems unlikely they narrated what they were doing over UHF given presumably the point of the telegraph is when voice comms aren't effective.

_comment: Vesna (Kadushkin): By Kamanin command we transmitted telegram with signal "KK" - that means "send control commands".

_comment: Cedar: (no reply).

_comment: Seems to be internal commentary that Kamanin ordered them to break protocol and send the reassuring message by voice. 'Orbit is calculated' probably refers to the work of NII-4 (see Saddiqi, p278) in determining the orbit parameters (important in subsequently timing the retro burn).

_comment: Vesna (Kadushkin): By command of Kamanin (33rd) turned on transmitters and send message on board: flight goes fine, orbit is calculated.

_comment: Cedar: Transmitted signal "DW" through telegraph — that means "devises work fine".

_note: Pilot transmitted signal "OH" via telegraph, meaning "the equipment is working properly".

_comment: Saddiqi (p279) has this as "VN". It's not hugely important, so I've retained the literal text from the Russian original.

_comment: at this point radio coverage passes from Khabarovsk to Moscow.
