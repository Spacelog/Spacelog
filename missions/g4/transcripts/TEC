     me a little information on the booster, the distance,
     what you have to do to get that close to see it, and
     how's the light working?

[00:00:45:07]
C: Roger. The light's working fine. I can't tell exactly
     how far it is though, I guess I'm probably a
     half a mile or so. The booster started tumbling
     right after we came off of it. I tried to dump the
     rates down, and I got them down till it looked like
     one-quarter degree per second but as soon as we got
     off I got around to see it, it was tumbling.

[00:00:45:25]

[00:00:45:28]
C: I got about 30 ft/sec showing on my window there.

[00:00:45:32]
CC: Okay.

[00:00:45:34]
C: The booster fell away quite rapidly and got below
     us like there was a considerable difference in our
     velocity, and I let the thing get too far from me.

[00:00:45:44]
CC: All right. Can you give me the battery readout?
     If they look good I can give you a GO for 3-4.

_page : 10
P: Roger. We're coming up on the booster now, and you
     can see the daylight starting to break. The lights
     are quite visible, and I estimate that we're probably
     in the vicinity of three-quarters of a mile from the
     booster at the time now. The lights are very easy
     to see, and the horizon is quite easily defined at
     this time. We've unstowed the Contarex, the Hasselblad,
     the 16-mm and the blood pressure cuff. We're
     both finding that there is not as much velcro as we'd
     like to have in the spacecraft. We feel like we need
     more storage of loose items. Same thing that John
     and Gus found.

     telling how far out I am from the booster. I can see
     the two lights flash occasionally, and that's the
     only thing that tells me where I am at all - as far
     as distance with respect to the booster. I didn't
     get the time to aline my platform well before I went
     into ...

C: Roger. The light's working fine. I can't tell
     exactly how far up I am from it. I guess I am
     probably around a half a mile or so. The booster
     started tumbling as we came off of it. I started
     to damp the rates down, and I got them down to what
     looked like a quarter degree per second, but as
     soon as we came off and I got around to see it, it

     the thing get too far from me.

[00:00:51:45]

P: It has a pretty good tumble rate. I'll try to time
     it here.

[00:01:14:37]
_page : 13
P: Makes about one complete revolution in about 8 seconds.
     It's tumbling end over end. It looks like
     now we're out a little further than we were before.
     We've slipped out a little bit. I'd estimate it's
     out about a mile and a half or maybe a little more.
     It was really quite a view when we first saw it
     down there. It looked like almost one of the artist's
     conceptions. It was so vividly clear.

[00:01:20:58]
_extra : Section GUAYMAS
P: Right now, we're in nose-to-the-ground type attitude,
     such that I don't believe the ground stations are
     able to read us. We have heard several calls cut in
     and out for us. We're going to stay in this attitude
     though for a while to keep the booster in sight. It
     doesn't appear that we're making too much progress
     in closing with the booster right now. It looks like
     it's staying out about the same distance as it was
     before. During the night sight when the booster was
     below us, it appeared that there was almost a sky
     full of stars. There was so much of the venting
     coming off the booster and into the sky. In fact,
     I commented on it that they looked like they were
     stars. When you look closely at the booster at that
     time, you could see the fuel -- actually the white
     vapors coming out of the aft end of the booster, and
     I guess that was spreading the little fireflies all
     around. It was to such an extent though, it covered
     the whole visible area in front of us.

[00:01:27:57]
P: Hello, Guaymas. This is Gemini 4.

[00:01:27:59]
CC: Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM.

[00:01:28:00]
P: Roger, Guaymas. We still have the booster. We're
     out quite a ways from it now, and it's taking a little
     more fuel than we had anticipated. We've got 61 in
     the fore and aft window in the aft direction, 37 left
     and 36 up at the present time. We appear right now
     to be just about holding our own with it. Of course,
     we should as we progress here. We should start to
     close with it, but it's out further than we had hoped
     to let it get right now.

[00:01:28:24]
CC: Roger, I copy.

[00:01:28:25]
C: Is there any way of giving me a quick check on what
     my orbit is? This thing is way below me.

[00:01:28:31]
_page : 14
CC: Say again.

[00:01:28:32]
C: I said the booster is way below me. Could you tell
     me my present orbit? As soon as possible.

[00:01:28:43]
CC: Roger, we're working on it.

[00:01:28:50]
CC: Gemini 4, we'll update you with the orbit calculations
     some time after the pass over the States.

[00:01:28:56]
P: Roger, I understand. And be advised our cabin pressure
     seems to be holding just a hair below 5. It
     stabilized down initially at 5.5, decreased to 5.25,
     and then went back up to 5.5, and it's now down a
     little below 5.

[00:01:29:15]
CC: Roger. We copy.

[00:01:29:16]
P: All right, you might get a confirmation for me on
     that on the ground.

[00:01:29:18]
CC: Roger. We're working on it. Put your Quantity Read
     Switch to READ.

[00:01:29:23]
P: Roger. It's going to READ.

[00:01:29:34]
C: Guaymas, this is Gemini 4. We're going to have to
     get a resolution right away whether you want me to
     really make a major effort to close this last thing
     or to save fuel.

[00:01:29:44]
C: Guaymas, do you read Gemini 4?

[00:01:29:46]
CC: Roger, we copy. We suggest you stand by. We want
     to save the fuel.

[00:01:29:51]
C: Okay. I guess it probably expended about 100 ft/sec.

[00:01:29:56]
C: You expended 100 ft/sec?

[00:01:30:01]
C: Yes, that's just a rough guess.

[00:01:31:01]
C: Well, I just can't wait till I get to the Cape. I
     guess we're just going to have to watch it go away.
     I've retrograded enough to help bring me down but I
     don't want to get down to wherever it's going.

CC: Jim, we've estimated you've used about 50 percent
     of your OAMS capability at this time.

[00:01:33:10]
C: Roger. I think we ought to knock it off, Gus. It
     keeps falling, it's probably three or four miles
     away, and we just can't close on it.

[00:01:33:16]
CC: Right, knock off. No more rendezvous with the
     booster.

[00:01:33:20]
C: Okay. Roger.

     could read with good reception on those stations.

P: All right. A very interesting thing - Jim's got full
     daylight out his window, and I have full night out
     of mine. We're gradually yawing around to blunt-end-forward,
     and it looks like the reflection of the sun
     on these fireflies causes them to glow very brightly.
     That was the type of stars that we saw on our first
     dark side.

     flashing like it's the booster. It appears that it's
     that type of an object unless it's picking up some
     glow from the sun. It appears a very bright, bright

     the reflection of the sun on the booster causes a
     very bright image. That's the object I had seen
     earlier. It seems like we're still in fair close

C: Go ahead, Carnarvon. Gemini 4.

[00:02:24:26]
CC: Roger. Will you give me a - - correction, will you
     start pumping up your blood pressure. I don't have
     any T/M as yet. Are you in real time in that
     position?

[00:02:24:34]
C: Stand by.

[00:02:24:38]
C: Negative. We're in COMMAND. Let me give you a real-time
     hack position.

[00:02:24:42]
CC: Roger.

[00:02:24:47]
C: Ed is off the comm. right now. He's trying to get
     his umbilical hooked up.

[00:02:24:50]
CC: Okay. We need a blood pressure immediately from the
     Command Pilot.

[00:02:24:57]
C: Well, stand by one. Listen, you might advise Flight
     by way of land lines that we're running late on this
     thing. There's a lot to do and we're having trouble
     keeping track of all this stuff.

[00:02:25:09]
CC: Okay.

[00:02:25:12]
C: I'll get the blood pressure as soon as I can get
     around to it.

[00:02:25:33]
CC: Give me the switch position on your C-band beacon.

[00:02:25:37]
C: Roger. It's COMMAND.

[00:02:25:40]
C: Do you want it back on CONTINUOUS?

[00:02:25:42]
CC: Affirmative. Back on CONTINUOUS.

[00:02:25:45]
C: Do you want them both on or just the reentry one?

[00:02:25:48]
C: Just the capsule.

[00:02:25:51]
_page : 23
C: Okay. The adapter's on. As soon as I get the blood
     pressure I'll give you a call.

[00:02:25:56]
CC: Okay.

[00:02:26:35]
CC: Full-scale on your blood pressure.

[00:02:26:48]
CC: Can give the Quantity Read Switch for about
     10 seconds?

[00:02:26:50]
C: Roger. I don't think you got a good blood pressure.
     The bulb popped off.

[00:02:26:53]
CC: Okay.

[00:02:27:10]
CC: Gemini 4, you are GO for EVA and decompression. Disregard
     the blood pressure unless you've got a few
     minutes and then try and get it for us. We'd appreciate it.

[00:02:27:17]
C: We don't have any time at all. We're really pressed
     here.

[00:02:27:21]
CC: Okay.

[00:02:27:29]
CC: Okay. After your first repressurization when you're
     about 12 to 15 minutes, we want you to go to BYPASS
     and return to FLOW after you repressurize again.

[00:02:27:37]
C: All right. You want us to go to BYPASS before we go
     to repressurize. Right?

[00:02:27:41]
CC: That'll be after your first repressurization.

[00:02:27:45]
C: Say again.

[00:02:27:47]
CC: Okay. Between your first and second repressurization,
     in that wait period, we want you to put your
     radiator to BYPASS and then to FLOW after you repressurize
     the second time.

[00:02:27:55]
C: Roger.

[00:02:28:28]
CC: Okay. We're done with your Quantity Read.

[00:02:28:30]
C: Roger.

[00:02:28:44]
CC: Okay. We're not going to say anything to you on the
     ground. If you need anything we'll wait.

[00:02:28:46]
C: Okay. Listen, has Houston been advised yet that we're
     running a little late and we might not be ready at
     Hawaii.

[00:02:28:55]
CC: Okay.

[00:02:29:09]
_page : 24
CC: Okay. Houston advised that if you are unable to
     make it, take your evaluation and we'll pick it up
     on the next pass.

[00:02:29:16]
C: Roger. Understand that.

[00:02:29:18]
CC: All right.

[00:02:29:21]
C: That's what we want to get clear.

[00:02:29:23]
CC: Roger.

[00:02:29:37]
CC: Okay. You don't have to acknowledge this - you're
     in a 89.2 by 155 orbit and it's a 4.8 day lifetime.

[00:02:29:41]
C: Roger.

[00:02:29:52]
CC: Turn your Right Secondary O<sub>2</sub> OPEN, your Left Secondary
     O<sub>2</sub> CLOSED.

[00:02:30:07]
CC: Houston advises you can use any attitude you want
     for the Extravehicular Activity.

[00:02:33:52]

     over Texas and they will give you a 4-4 load.

[00:02:54:33]
C: Okay. Very good.

[00:02:54:35]
CC: That's all we have for you.

[00:02:54:37]
C: Thank you. We'll talk to you in about an hour and
     a half.

[00:02:54:41]
CC: Roger. Hawaii out.

[00:02:57:05]
C: Jim McDivitt. Right now it's about T+3 hours.
     When we came off the booster at SECO, we had rates
     of around half a degree a second. I tried to damp
     them out and finally came off around SECO + 30 seconds.
     It seemed that as we came off we might have
     come off with some other rates. What do you think,
     Ed?

[00:02:57:36]
P: Yes, we did. I wasn't watching as we came off, but
     it felt like we did come off.

[00:02:57:41]
C: Yes, at spacecraft separation. It seems to me we
     came off with some rates, the direction of which
     I couldn't really tell, but ...

[00:02:57:48]
P: Felt like we went this way to me.

[00:02:57:51]
C: Yes.

[00:02:57:52]
P: We didn't get a linear type forward separation.

[00:02:57:56]
C: Yes.

[00:02:57:58]
C: As we got turned around, we came right on around,
     and found ourselves about 300 or 400 feet from the
     booster. I guess that was about right, wouldn't
     you say?

[00:02:58:08]
P: Yes.

[00:02:58:10]
C: I thrusted toward the booster about 5 ft/sec. My
     separation burn was around the neighborhood of 6 or
     7 seconds. I thrusted at the booster for about
     5 or 6 ft/sec and then watched it as we were separating
     from it. I thrusted about another 5 ft/sec.
     Looked like we started closing - we started closing
     from off to the side and at about 600 to 700 feet, I
     guess. If you think any of these numbers are wrong
     just call out.

[00:02:59:50]
P: No.

[00:02:59:53]
_page : 27
C: And then it looked like all apparent motion had
     stopped and we were probably closing. So I turned
     the spacecraft around and made an attempt to aline
     the platform. In the meantime, the booster started
     dropping down below us at a rather obvious rate.
     So I gave up trying to aline the platform to line
     up and thrust down toward the booster, and I retrofired
     slightly to slow down with it. Once again,
     it looked like our rates were stopped. But by now
     we had drifted out to about 1000 feet or so. We
     then tracked the booster across Africa pointing
     down at it all the way. We got in to sunset pretty
     quick and at sunset I guess we were at about
     1200 feet, Ed?

[00:02:59:59]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.

[00:03:00:00]
P: Yes, we were in fairly close.

[00:03:00:02]
C: We were at 1200 feet and closing slightly.

[00:03:00:09]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.

P: I'll get them.

[00:03:00:10]
C: Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.

[00:03:00:15]

[00:03:00:17]
C: Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.

_extra : (Watch Timed)
CC: Roger. Jim, you're going to be live as you make
     your pass across the States this time.

[00:03:00:24]
C: Okay. Anything in particular you wanted me to say?

[00:03:00:31]
CC: Suit yourself.

[00:03:00:33]
C: Okay.

[00:03:00:39]
CC: Hey, Jim. Could you give me an idea of how much
     you - what was the ratio of your thruster use, how
     much you used your aft firing, and how much you used
     your forward firing thrusters back early in the
     Flight Plan?

[00:03:00:50]
C: Yes. I'll give you percentage. I used the top
     thrusters down for about 10 or 15 seconds, I guess.
     I used the aft firing ones almost the entire time
     aside from that.

[00:03:01:13]
CC: Roger. I copy. Ten or 15 seconds on the down, almost
     all the rest of it on the aft.

[00:03:01:18]
_page : 28
C: Eight or 10 seconds on the forward firing ones, but
     that's about all.

[00:03:01:21]
_extra : (End of Watch Timing)
CC: Roger.

[00:03:01:29]

     to circle around with us, but it's just too
     far off to go get.

[00:03:01:33]
CC: Roger. Hey, would you check your ACQ aid circuit
     breaker and make sure it's ON.

[00:03:01:37]
C: Make sure that it's OFF?

[00:03:01:38]
CC: It's ON.

[00:03:01:41]
C: Okay. It's OFF at this time. It's coming back ON.

[00:03:01:44]
CC: Okay. It's coming ON.

[00:03:01:47]
C: Negative. It's coming ON.

[00:03:01:49]
CC: Roger. ON.

[00:03:01:51]
C: Righto.

[00:03:02:09]
CC: Hey, Jim, you do have your computer ON, don't you?

[00:03:02:13]
C: Negative. I don't have it ON. Do you want it ON
     at this time?

[00:03:02:15]
CC: Roger. Turn it ON. We're going to give you a 4-4
     time.

[00:03:02:18]
C: Okay. I thought we were going to get it later.
     I'll turn it ON at this time.

[00:03:02:23]
CC: At PRELAUNCH Mode.

[00:03:02:26]
C: Roger. PRELAUNCH.

[00:03:02:43]
CC: Computer light is on. We're ready.

[00:03:02:46]
CC: Say again, Jim.

[00:03:02:47]
C: I say, my computer light is on. We're ready.

[00:03:02:49]
CC: Roger.

[00:03:03:04]
CC: I think you did a smart thing back there.

[00:03:03:08]
C: Yes, Gus. It would have been a short flight if we'd
     kept chasing that mother around.

[00:03:03:12]
CC: Yes. Sounds like you've been awfully busy the first
     couple of orbits, you know.

[00:03:03:17]
_page : 29
C: It would have been impossible. We would never have
     done the EVA at all.

[00:03:03:29]
C: We're finally getting a chance to look out here, Gus,
     and it's really nice.

[00:03:04:16]
CC: Hey, Jim. Jim, this is Houston. Hey, Gemini 4,
     Houston CAP COM.

[00:03:04:24]
C: Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.

[00:03:04:26]
CC: How about describing the way the cockpit is laid out
     now, with all of your gear out?

[00:03:04:35]
C: Okay. Well, we've got to the get-out position here,
     and when we finally called it quits it was obvious
     that we weren't going to make it at that time without
     really rushing. I didn't want to do that.

[00:03:04:44]
CC: Roger.

[00:03:04:46]
C: Ed has most of the equipment on him right now. I've
     got the gun and the camera and the hatch fitting, the
     fitting to tie the two suit hoses together. Ed has
     all the other paraphernalia on him right now, but he's
     on the suit circuit. He's got the Repress valve OFF
     and we're just about all set to go. I think when we
     get about over Africa we're going to go through the
     checklist again, and when we get to Carnarvon we'll
     be all set.

[00:03:05:22]
CC: Roger. Have you taken any pictures yet?

[00:03:05:25]
C: No. As a matter of fact, we really haven't had time
     to do much.

[00:03:08:19]
C: I don't even know where it is right now, Gus.

[00:03:08:21]

CC: Roger, we read you. Go ahead.

[00:03:13:32]
C: Roger. How about turning the computer OFF?

[00:03:13:34]
CC: Roger, turn OFF the computer.

[00:03:13:37]
C: Okay.

[00:03:15:54]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.

[00:03:15:55]
C: Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.

[00:03:15:56]
CC: Hey, your cabin temperature came down 10° since
     you turned your heat exchanger ON.

[00:03:16:02]
C: Roger.

[00:03:16:29]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston.

[00:03:16:33]
C: Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.

[00:03:16:34]
CC: As you come over Ascension I want to try to give you
     a check there. The air-ground remote hasn't worked
     too well today but we sure would like to get that
     one up.

[00:03:16:41]
C: Roger, we'll be waiting.

[00:03:16:44]
CC: Roger.

[00:03:16:45]
C: Would you advise, we've both had a drink, and I had
     10 swallows.

[00:03:16:51]
CC: Roger.

[00:03:27:42]
P: We've got another sighting on the booster. It looks
     like it's just about horizontal with us and right
     straight out in front of us.

[00:03:27:48]
C: Small-end-forward.

[00:03:27:49]
P: We are going small-end-forward and it looks like it's
     very close to our orbit.

[00:03:27:58]
C: And it's at about 3:28 elapsed time.

[00:03:29:48]
P: The lights on the booster are still blinking. I can
     see them at this time.

[00:03:34:00]
C: We're just at 3+34 right now. Just going into darkness.
     The sunlight has been shining on the nose of
     the spacecraft with small-end-forward, just about.
     Actually, we're 30° left of being straight ahead,
     small-end-forward. And the way the sun was shining
     on the edge of the booster ... spacecraft was
     causing a reflection, just like someone had a mirror
     there and was shining it straight ahead.

[00:03:34:34]
_page : 33
P: Yes, that's what ... that last time, Jim.

[00:03:34:41]
C: A bunch of thunderstorms out on the horizon.

[00:03:34:51]
C: Okay. We get to Carnarvon at 3:58. That's when
     we're going to get our GO. We start our depressurization
     right there. What we're going to do is
     that we're going to open the Repress, tighten your
     helmet, ...

[00:03:35:17]
P: We've got one thing left to do in the steps. We've
     got to take these off, Jim.

[00:03:35:20]
C: Take what off?

[00:03:35:21]
P: The suit pressure lines and put them on the interconnect.

[00:03:35:25]
C: Yes, that's not yet though ...

[00:03:35:28]
P: Do you have the interconnect over there handy?

[00:03:35:29]
C: Yes, I've got it right here.

[00:03:35:30]
P: Okay.

[00:03:35:31]
C: This is in the egress.

P: All right.

[00:03:35:32]
C: When we start at Carnarvon.

[00:03:35:34]
C: Open the Repress Valve. Okay, this is what we're
     going to do. Helmet tied on?

[00:03:35:38]
P: Yes.

[00:03:35:40]
C: Right Suit Flow Control OFF?

[00:03:35:45]
P: Right.

[00:03:35:46]
C: Disconnect inlet and outlet ECS hoses. Remove your
     interconnect.

[00:03:36:14]
C: Okay, let's see. Remove the interconnect. Interconnect
     the two ECS hoses ... by your elbow.

[00:03:36:24]
P: Okay.

C: Pack Primary O<sub>2</sub> OPEN.

[00:03:36:28]
P: Roger.

[00:03:36:29]
C: Not yet.

[00:03:36:30]
P: No.

[00:03:36:33]
C: EVA Emergency Shut off OPEN.

[00:03:36:36]
P: Roger. Check the FLOW.

[00:03:36:37]
_page : 34
C: Check the emergency FLOW and then back to CLOSED.

[00:03:36:38]
P: Roger.

[00:03:36:40]
C: Recheck your suit, your pack, and tether.

[00:03:36:42]
P: Roger.

[00:03:36:43]
C: Recheck your face-plate closed and locked. Helmet
     locked, gloves on, inlet-outlet "Y", and ECS hoses
     free. And then I'll have a Command Pilot Suit Check,
     which I've already done ... on to check the flow.
     Hatch lock OPEN. Then you've got your other things
     to check. When we actually start the Depressurization
     Mode, Cabin Vent valve go to 2 psi, then we
     close the vent valve. Then we install both blood
     pressure pump plugs, which I don't seem to be able
     to find.

[00:03:38:05]
C: Gee, I don't even have one on my suit.

[00:03:38:07]
P: I don't have one either, Jim.

[00:03:38:15]
C: Swell.

[00:03:38:18]
P: Aw, baloney.

[00:03:38:23]
P: I sure don't see one.

[00:03:38:30]
C: Nope, I don't have one.

[00:03:38:31]
P: I don't either, unless it's up under my cover.

[00:03:38:42]
C: No, you don't have one, Ed.

[00:03:38:45]
P: The hole's not big enough but still you ought to
     have one.

[00:03:38:50]
C: Right.

[00:03:39:00]
P: Neither of our suits have the blood pressure cuff -
     blood pressure plug

[00:03:39:07]
P: And we just had a very pretty moonset.

[00:03:39:10]
C: Just a casual comment here. We looked out and
     thought we saw the horizon. It turned out, it was
     obviously air glow. We could see the stars well below
     its edge.

[00:03:49:10]
C: We'll talk about this some more later when we get
     more time.

[00:03:50:07]
_page : 35
P: We noticed the old familiar pulsing in the suits
     when we had the RECIRC closed all the way down and
     our dampers that time were open full in both suits.
     It was the same type of a pulsation that occurred
     in altitude chamber and which was, I believe, duplicated
     in the testing.

[00:03:50:33]
_extra : Section CARNARVON
P: Cabin pressure seems to hold around 4.8 to 5.0,
     right on the bottom. Also, our Left Secondary Oxygen
     is pretty high, looks like it's up around 5400.
     Been that way ever since we started.

[00:03:57:34]
CC: Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.

[00:03:57:36]
C: Go ahead, Carnarvon. Gemini 4. How do you read?

[00:03:57:38]
CC: Loud and clear. Will you turn you cabin fan OFF,
     heat exchanger full warm?

[00:03:57:45]
C: Carnarvon, Gemini 4.

[00:03:57:46]
CC: Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.

[00:03:57:50]
CC: Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM. Over.

[00:03:57:59]
C: Hello, Carnarvon. Hello, Carnarvon. Gemini 4.

[00:03:58:01]
CC: Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.

[00:03:58:04]
C: Roger, Carnarvon. Gemini 4. How do you read?

[00:03:58:07]
CC: Loud and clear. How me? Over.

[00:03:58:08]
C: Loud and clear.

[00:03:58:10]
CC: Roger. Will you turn your cabin fan OFF. Heat
     exchanger full warm?

[00:03:58:15]
C: Roger.

[00:03:58:18]
CC: Roger. We'd like a blood pressure from the Command
     Pilot.

[00:03:58:30]
P: The cabin fan does give a noticeable squeal when
     it's on. I notice now that the fan is off. I
     notice a definite decrease.

[00:03:58:35]
CC: What's your status on EVA?

[00:03:58:37]
C: The status is GO for EVA.

[00:03:58:39]
_page : 36
CC: Okay. You're GO for EVA from here. Stand by for
     decompression - correction, depressurization. Can
     you give us a blood pressure? On the Command Pilot?

[00:03:58:43]
C: The status is GO for EVA.

[00:03:58:45]
P: The cabin appears to be venting at about 5.3. Just
     heard the vent valve going ... for EVA.

[00:03:58:49]
C: Roger. I'm going to try to give you a blood pressure
     right now.

[00:03:58:51]
CC: All right.

[00:03:59:15]
CC: Okay. Keep coming, it's coming up.

[00:03:59:24]
CC: You are up to full-scale.

[00:03:59:37]
CC: Can you give me about 10 seconds on your Quantity
     Read switch, please?

[00:03:59:57]
P: Quantity Read is ON.

[00:03:59:58]
CC: Roger.

[00:04:00:08]
P: Quantity Read is OFF.

[00:04:00:10]
CC: Roger.

[00:04:00:16]
CC: Okay. We got a good blood pressure from you.

[00:04:00:19]
CC: Your Right Secondary O<sub>2</sub> should be OPEN and your
     Left Secondary O<sub>2</sub> should be CLOSED.

[00:04:00:26]
P: That is affirmative. That's the configuration. The
     left is CLOSED; the right is OPEN.

[00:04:00:31]
C: We have a GO to start decompression, is that right?

[00:04:00:34]
CC: That's affirmative for decompression and a GO for
     EVA.

[00:04:00:37]
C: Roger ... call again near Hawaii.

[00:04:00:41]
CC: Roger. Very good.

[00:04:01:02]
CC: We'd like for you to turn your Quantity Switch to
     READ from now on until the end of the EVA.

[00:04:01:07]
CC: Okay. I got it on.

[00:04:01:10]
CC: I'll be standing by here on the ground and keep the
     conversation down.

[00:04:01:13]
C: Roger.

[00:04:07:21]
P: Okay.

[00:04:07:24]
C: Hatch lock OPEN.

[00:04:07:29]
_page : 37
P: Hatch locks are OPEN.

[00:04:07:30]
C: Okay.

[00:04:07:33]
C: Don your other thermal gloves. I guess you got one
     of them.

[00:04:07:38]
P: The thermal gloves didn't work out too bad, Jim.

[00:04:07:42]
C: Yes. Okay. We're going to vent the cabin now.

[00:04:07:43]
P: Yes.

[00:04:07:45]
C: Two psi. Did you get that, ... Ed? We're going
     to close vent valve and we're going to check those
     blood pressure readings that we have. We're going
     to check the suits for leaks at 2 psi. Check yours
     to make sure that suit ... one. Okay?

[00:04:08:00]
P: Ready to go.

[00:04:08:09]
C: Hear the valve?

[00:04:08:10]
P: Roger.

[00:04:08:12]
C: Carnarvon, do you still read Gemini 4?

[00:04:08:22]
C: Are we ...

[00:04:10:45]
P: Okay.

[00:04:10:48]
P: I hear it - I'll keep mine...where do you...oh, you
     want mine? All right, I'm sorry, Jim.

[00:04:10:50]
P: All right.

[00:04:10:53]
C: Okay.

[00:04:10:55]
P: Roger, we're in a vacuum now and the right suit is
     holding at 4 and the flow is satisfactory. I'm not
     overly warm.

[00:04:11:02]
C: Okay. We've got the cabin vent valve open ...
     cabin at zero. Time to unlock the hatch.

[00:04:11:10]
P: Roger. Time to unlock the hatch.

[00:04:11:12]
C: ...

[00:04:11:17]
P: Well, the thing about it, I've got to do something
     with the cabin ...

[00:04:11:21]
P: Okay.

[00:04:11:24]
C: What are we going to do with ... ?

[00:04:11:26]
P: Hold on to it, cause I can't ... it.

[00:04:11:29]
C: ...

[00:04:11:50]
_page : 38
C: What's the matter? Isn't it working?

[00:04:11:53]
P: Uh huh.

[00:04:11:55]
P: ... work up here.

[00:04:12:02]
C: ... unlocked ...

[00:04:12:05]
P: Yes, I know they're unlocked.

[00:04:12:07]
P: I'11 look again.

[00:04:12:09]
P: That's why I had these gloves made this way so I
     could take them off.

[00:04:12:12]
C: Right.

[00:04:12:17]
C: ... you're staying up with it, buddy.

[00:04:12:19]
P: What?

[00:04:12:24]
P: That's up.

[00:04:12:26]
C: Say again.

[00:04:12:28]
P: They're both on UP.

[00:04:12:31]
C: Okay.

[00:04:12:45]
C: Now you have ...

[00:04:12:55]
P: I know it.

[00:04:13:07]
P: Three cycles.

[00:04:13:08]
C: Okay, let me stand by for a minute here and get the
     ... controls.

[00:04:13:29]
P: ... to LOCK so we can get on it. Okay now, that's
     working.

[00:04:13:53]
C: Take it easy, Ed ...

[00:04:14:09]
C: Woke up?

[00:04:14:11]
P: Yes, just wait a minute.

[00:04:14:14]
C: Yes, but listen, don't you ... Stand by one, Ed.

[00:04:14:18]
P: Are they doing anything?

C: ...

[00:04:14:19]
P: Are they moving?

[00:04:14:22]
C: No, they're not moving a bit.

[00:04:14:24]
C: Think we're ...

[00:04:14:32]
P: Hold these a minute, will you?

[00:04:14:36]
_page : 39
C: Just take it easy. If we don't make it this time,
     we'll make it next time.

[00:04:14:38]
P: Roger. Next time around.

[00:04:14:41]
C: Or tomorrow.

[00:04:14:43]
C: You can't see too well with that visor on either,
     can you?

[00:04:14:56]
P: They're both on UNLOCK.

[00:04:15:10]
C: ...

[00:04:15:17]
P: Are they moving, Jim?

[00:04:15:19]
C: Stand by. I can't see ...

[00:04:15:27]
C: Negative, it looks like they're not moving at all.

[00:04:15:43]
P: Looks like that thing, isn't moving.

[00:04:15:45]
P: I'll take it easy a minute.

[00:04:15:48]
C: Yes, no sweat.

[00:04:16:08]
C: You know, it's a good thing we can't get it open
     and not close.

[00:04:16:10]
P: Yes.

[00:04:16:15]
C: Let's not leave it OFF.

[00:04:16:17]
P: I'm on LOCK now.

[00:04:16:24]
C: Where're you going?

[00:04:16:33]
P: This is the first time it's ever failed this way.

[00:04:16:36]
C: Sure is.

[00:04:16:39]
C: No it isn't either. It failed that way up at
     McDonnell.

[00:04:16:42]
P: So that it wouldn't move at all?

[00:04:16:43]
C: Yes.

[00:04:16:45]
P: So it was just free swiveling.

[00:04:16:48]
C: Yes, it - I know what the trouble is. It's a spring
     pushing it back.

[00:04:17:00]
C: I think it will be all right.

[00:04:17:02]
C: Let me go to MANUAL and ...

[00:04:17:30]
P: I got it, Jim.

[00:04:17:31]
C: Wait a second.

[00:04:17:33]
P: Okay.

[00:04:17:36]
_page : 40
P: You got it?

[00:04:17:37]
C: Yes, I got it.

[00:04:17:39]
P: All right.

[00:04:17:40]
C: Okay, now make sure you get that mother back on.

[00:04:17:43]
P: Back in LOCK.

[00:04:17:44]
C: All the way?

[00:04:17:45]
P: Yes.

[00:04:17:48]
C: Okay. You got it LOCKED, UNLOCKED all the way then?

[00:04:17:50]
P: Yes, I do, Jim.

[00:04:17:53]
P: They're all back in LOCK now?

[00:04:17:56]
P: Okay. I'm going to take it easy now.

[00:04:18:00]
C: Yes, do that. Now, I want to get the spacecraft
     right-side up and leave that last ...

[00:04:18:04]
P: What a view! By golly. You can see the black sky
     up above.

[00:04:18:10]
C: Okay, just a second. Let me get the spacecraft
     where I want it.

[00:04:18:12]
P: All right.

[00:04:18:17]
P: Door's a little harder to move than I thought.

[00:04:18:21]
P: Yes.

[00:04:18:28]
P: It sure is clear and crystal smooth.

[00:04:18:33]
P: Are we on VOX, Jim?

[00:04:18:36]
C: Something just fell out.

[00:04:18:38]
P: It was a bolt.

[00:04:18:41]
C: No, it was a big white thing.

[00:04:18:43]
P: It's my ... it's adrift probably, huh?

[00:04:18:44]
C: What?

[00:04:18:45]
P: It's my lanyard.

[00:04:18:48]
C: No, I thought I saw it floating away ...

[00:04:18:51]
C: Oh, yes. You can...

[00:04:19:00]
P: Okay, my visor's down.

[00:04:19:12]
C: Okay, take it easy.

[00:04:19:14]
P: Right.

[00:04:19:19]
_page : 41
C: ...

[00:04:19:33]
P: I'm going out there to install the cameras, Jim.

[00:04:19:36]
C: Okay.

[00:04:19:41]
P: The sun's very bright back this way.

[00:04:19:43]
C: Is it?

[00:04:19:45]
P: Yes.

[00:04:19:46]
C: ... your visor.

[00:04:19:48]
P: Got my visor down.

[00:04:19:50]
C: Your foot.

[00:04:19:52]
P: Huh?

[00:04:19:55]
C: You're going to have to watch your foot.

[00:04:19:57]
P: Okay.

[00:04:20:00]
P: You see, I have to turn all around to do this, Jim.

[00:04:20:02]
C: Yes, I know.

[00:04:20:04]
C: Just move it all over the equipment there.

[00:04:20:05]
P: All right.

[00:04:20:17]
P: I can see your thrusters firing.

[00:04:20:24]
P: We're taking some pictures now.

[00:04:20:36]
P: Am I clobbering the switches, Jim?

[00:04:20:38]
C: Yes, you're really all over 'em, Ed.

[00:04:20:41]
P: Okay. Hand me the umbilical guard.

[00:04:20:45]
C: Take it easy now. You sound like you're pulsing.

[00:04:20:49]
P: No, I'm in good shape.

[00:04:20:50]
C: Listen, hold it. Hold it. Hold it.

[00:04:20:55]
P: You got it through?

[00:04:20:56]
C: No, hold on.

[00:04:21:00]
P: Roger. Got plenty of time. Boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

[00:04:21:02]
C: Pretty neat, huh?

[00:04:21:03]
P: Yes, it's something!

[00:04:21:05]
C: Think we're T/M ... Here, I got one of your gloves
     ... I got both of your gloves.

[00:04:21:09]
P: Yes, I don't even need them right now.

[00:04:21:17]
_page : 42
C: Okay ... the T/M. They're calling back now.

[00:04:21:29]
P: As 'Ole Leonov' says, (illegible) work out in
     space. It isn't very much, but I'm doing something.

[00:04:21:33]
C: Pretty black out there, isn't it?

[00:04:21:36]
P: Yes.

[00:04:21:38]
P: Okay, I turned the camera off, so I would save it.

[00:04:21:47]
P: Oh, I just knocked it off the mount.

[00:04:21:48]
C: Did you?

[00:04:21:50]
P: Yes, I'll go back and get it.

[00:04:21:55]
C: Tell me. How do you like this glass?

[00:04:21:57]
P: That's fine.

[00:04:22:02]
P: You know, I'm kinda glad I got the visor on ...
     for the work I'm doing.

[00:04:22:07]
C: Pretty bright?

[00:04:22:09]
P: Well, I'm looking right into it.

[00:04:22:17]
C: Your jiggling around actually moves the spacecraft.

[00:04:22:19]
P: Does it? I can see it pulsing.

[00:04:22:29]
P: Okay. I'm going to feed the umbilical out.

[00:04:22:31]
C: Okay. Be careful you don't trip some of the switches.
     Let me give it to you.

[00:04:22:37]
P: Okay. Feed her out slow.

[00:04:22:43]
C: Okay. I've got ...

[00:04:22:48]
P: All right.

C: Hawaii, do you read Gemini 4?

[00:04:23:17]
CC: Gemini 4, Hawaii.

[00:04:23:19]
C: Hello, Hawaii. Hello, Hawaii. Gemini 4. How do
     you read?

[00:04:23:22]
CC: Roger. Read you loud and clear. Can you give us
     a status on your decompression?

[00:04:23:24]
_page : 43
C: We're going to put you on RECORD so the whole world
     can hear this later on.

[00:04:23:26]
P: All right.

[00:04:23:28]
C: Hawaii, Gemini 4. Do you read?

[00:04:23:30]
C: You're on RECORD. We're on CONTINUOUS INTERPHONE-PUSH
     TO TALK. Still on UHF.

CC: Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Read you loud and clear.
     How me?

[00:04:23:32]
C: Very good, Ed. Very good.

[00:04:23:38]
CC: Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Do you read?

[00:04:23:39]
C: Stand by one.

[00:04:24:40]
CC: Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Read you loud and clear.
     What is your status on decompression?

[00:04:24:46]
C: Hello, Hawaii, Hello, Hawaii. Gemini 4. Do you
     read?

[00:04:24:51]
CC: Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Read you loud and clear.
     How me?

[00:04:24:54]
C: Loud and clear. We're on VOX. I guess you aren't
     getting us on VOX.

[00:04:24:57]
CC: Roger. We just now received you. What is your
     status on decompression?

[00:04:25:02]
C: Got the outside 60-mm camera mounted, and he's
     getting the gun ready right now.

[00:04:25:09]
CC: Roger. I understand. Can you give us a reading on
     emergency O<sub>2</sub>?

[00:04:25:16]
CC: Did you copy, Gemini 4?

[00:04:25:18]
C: Roger. You mean the emergency O<sub>2</sub> in Ed's bottle?

[00:04:25:21]
CC: Affirmative.

C: It's 34 right now.

[00:04:25:30]
C: Say something.

[00:04:25:31]
P: It's 34 right now. Hasn't changed a step. How do
     you read?

[00:04:25:36]
CC: Roger. Read you loud and clear Pilot. How me?

P: Outside the spacecraft, as a matter of fact.

[00:04:25:42]
_page : 44
CC: Roger. Understand.

[00:04:26:07]
C: Roger. He has the hatch open. He's standing in
     the seat.

[00:04:26:11]
CC: Roger. Understand. Houston will give you a GO or
     NO GO to exit spacecraft over Guaymas. Did you
     copy?

[00:04:26:26]
CC: Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.

[00:04:26:28]
C: Go ahead, Hawaii, Gemini 4.

[00:04:26:30]
CC: Roger. Did you copy my last? Houston will give
     you GO-NO GO to exit spacecraft over Guaymas.

[00:04:26:36]
C: Roger. Everything looks good here. What do you
     think?

[00:04:26:40]
CC: We're happy with it.

[00:04:26:42]
CC: Everything looks good on the ground, Gemini 4.

[00:04:26:46]
C: Very good.

[00:04:27:19]
C: Our ECS is still good. It's reading still 50 percent.
     Looks like we're not even using any.

[00:04:27:26]
CC: We concur on the ground.

[00:04:27:31]
C: When he's moving around out there, he's really rocking
     the spacecraft around.

[00:04:27:35]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[00:04:28:11]
CC: Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.

[00:04:28:13]
C: Go ahead, Hawaii. Gemini 4.

[00:04:28:14]
CC: Roger. We just had word from Houston. We're ready
     to have you get out whenever you're ready. Give us
     a mark when you egress the spacecraft.

[00:04:28:25]
C: Okay. We've got our GO now. Is that right?

[00:04:28:26]
CC: Affirmative.

[00:04:28:27]
C: Okay.

[00:04:28:39]
CC: Be sure and give us a mark when he egresses.

[00:04:28:43]
C: Okay. We're still doing a little work right here.

[00:04:28:45]
CC: Roger. Understand.

C: Okay ...

[00:04:29:28]
CC: Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. What is your status now?

[00:04:29:30]
C: Roger. We're about ready to start getting out.
     Ed just got one of his gloves back on. He'll put
     another one on and then he'll be ready to go.

[00:04:29:33]
P: I'm not going to carry it, Jim. I don't need it.

[00:04:29:38]
C: You're not going to carry it?

[00:04:29:40]
C: Okay. We're all set, Ed, right now. Ready to go
     out slowly.

[00:04:29:41]
CC: Can you repeat, Gemini 4?

[00:04:29:43]
P: Yes.

[00:04:29:44]
C: Listen, do you want me to get the spacecraft in any
     other attitude or does this look okay?

[00:04:29:48]
P: Looks okay, Jim.

[00:04:29:50]
C: Okay. I'll tell you when.

CC: Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Can you repeat your last
     transmission?

[00:04:29:52]
P: I'm ready.

[00:04:29:53]
C: Okay, stand by one. I want to get my timer set.
     I'll give you a GO in just about 2 minutes - or less.

[00:04:29:59]
CC: Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Do you copy?

[00:04:30:00]
P: I'm going to have to let the camera run out because
     it's too hard to work.

[00:04:30:02]
C: Okay, just a second.

[00:04:30:06]
P: Ready.

[00:04:30:07]
C: Okay, go ahead.

[00:04:30:11]
CC: Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Do you copy?

[00:04:30:19]
P: Okay. I'm separating from the spacecraft.

[00:04:30:21]
C: Okay. He's separated from the spacecraft at this
     time, Hawaii.

[00:04:30:25]
C: ...

[00:04:30:26]
P: Okay. My feet are out.

[00:04:30:27]
_page : 46
C: Okay. His feet are out.

[00:04:30:29]
P: I think I'm dragging a little bit, so I don't want
     to fire the gun yet.

[00:04:30:33]
C: ...

[00:04:30:36]
P: Okay. I'm out.

[00:04:30:38]
C: Okay. He's out. He's floating free.

[00:04:30:48]
P: Okay. I put a little roll in, took it right out.

[00:04:30:50]
C: Very good.

[00:04:31:00]
P: Am I in your view, Jimbo?

[00:04:31:02]
C: Well, you know I can't see ...

[00:04:31:04]
P: Don't sweat it. I'll come to you.

[00:04:31:12]
C: Oops! There goes your glove. Well, we'll just let
     it go.

[00:04:31:14]
P: All right.

[00:04:31:19]
P: Okay. I rolled off and I'm rolling to the right now.
     Under my own influence. There goes a - looks like
     a thermal glove, Jim.

[00:04:31:26]
C: It is, Ed.

[00:04:31:28]
P: All right. Now, I've come above the spacecraft and
     I'm under my own control.

[00:04:31:45]
P: It really looks funny to see my glove out there, Jim.

[00:04:31:48]
C: Does it?

[00:04:31:50]
P: Yes. Okay, I'd better get over. Okay, I'm coming
     over.

[00:04:32:00]
C: Okay. Stand by.

[00:04:32:02]
P: See me yet?

[00:04:32:04]
C: No, sure don't.

[00:04:32:05]
P: Huh?

[00:04:32:07]
P: Oh, there you are. I can spin around now.

[00:04:32:12]
C: Okay. Just a second. You're right in front, Ed.
     You look beautiful.

[00:04:32:16]
P: I feel like a million dollars. All right we'll pitch
     up and yaw left. I'm coming back to you.

CC: Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.

[00:04:32:24]
C: Stand by. I get the swizzle stick out of here.

CC: Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.

[00:04:32:31]
P: Okay. I put in a little bit too much pitch there.

[00:04:32:36]
P: The gun works real great, Jim.

[00:04:32:38]
C: Let me get over where I can see you, Ed.

[00:04:32:40]
P: Take it easy now. You're in a vacuum.

CC: Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.

[00:04:32:42]
C: Ha! Ha? No, I want to get the spacecraft on the
     horizon.

[00:04:32:47]
P: All right.

[00:04:32:50]
P: Okay. I'll come in and take a look at you now.

[00:04:32:52]
C: Wait a second. Let me take your picture.

CC: Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.

[00:04:32:55]
P: Just a minute - just a minute.

[00:04:33:04]
P: This gun is very good.

[00:04:33:07]
C: Is it?

[00:04:33:08]
CC: Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.

[00:04:33:09]
P: Yes. I've got me upside down. Now I see my glove
     is departing.

[00:04:33:14]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.

[00:04:33:16]
P: Okay. Don't fire the thrusters.

C: Okay. Don't. I'm going on. Who's calling
     Gemini 4?

[00:04:33:20]
CC: Houston CAP COM. Has he egressed?

[00:04:33:24]
C: He's out, Gus and it's really nifty. Listen, our
     VOX doesn't work very well, and I don't seem to
     read anybody. You will have to relay. The gun
     works swell. He's been able to maneuver all over -
     out front, back under the nose, and he's back out
     again.

[00:04:33:34]
CC: Say again.

[00:04:33:35]
C: ... work very well, but I don't think he can read
     anybody. So I'll have to relay. The gun works
     swell. He's been able to maneuver all over - out
     front, back under the nose, and he's back out again.

[00:04:33:45]
CC: That's great!

C: Ed?

[00:04:33:46]
_page : 48
P: Yes.

[00:04:33:48]
C: Let me try VOX again. Say something.

[00:04:33:52]
P: Hello, Gus. How do you read, CAP COM?

[00:04:33:56]
C: Hey, Gus, do you read?

[00:04:33:58]
CC: I read you now, Ed.

[00:04:34:00]
C: It's not really working, Ed.

[00:04:34:02]
P: All right.

[00:04:34:04]
C: Okay. Listen, I still can't see you out there.

[00:04:34:05]
CC: It's working. Keep talking.

[00:04:34:07]
P: All right. I've drifted off to the side. I think
     we're going to have ... I'm taking pictures now,
     Jim.

[00:04:34:11]
CC: Gemini 4, it's working. Keep talking.

C: Okay.

[00:04:34:15]
C: Make that flag look pretty.

[00:04:34:19]
P: Yes.

[00:04:34:21]
P: Okay. I'm right by the stub antenna now.

[00:04:34:24]
CC: Gemini 4, keep talking. It's working.

C: Okay. Let me get some ... to you, Ed. I ought
     to be getting some tremendous pictures of you. Let
     me try again with the Hasselblad.

[00:04:34:30]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.

[00:04:34:31]
P: Okay. I think I've exhausted my air now.

[00:04:34:33]
C: Okay.

[00:04:34:36]
C: Stay right there.

[00:04:34:40]
P: I had very good control with it. I just needed
     more air.

[00:04:34:45]
C: Okay. Stand by. Let me take a couple of pictures,
     ole buddy.

[00:04:34:48]
P: All right.

[00:04:34:52]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.

[00:04:34:54]
C: Go ahead, Gus.

[00:04:34:58]
CC: Tell him to keep talking. We're receiving Ed
     through your VOX.

[00:04:35:00]
_page : 49
P: Are you reading me, CAP COM?

[00:04:35:01]
P: ... Gus?

[00:04:35:02]
C: Okay. We're going to VOX now.

[00:04:35:04]
C: Okay, Ed. They're receiving you.

[00:04:35:07]
P: Okay.

[00:04:35:09]
C: Tell them what you think.

[00:04:35:10]
P: That's right, CAP COM, it's very easy to maneuver
     with the gun. The only problem I have is that I
     haven't got enough fuel. I've exhausted the fuel
     now and I was able to maneuver myself around the
     front of the spacecraft, back, and maneuver right
     up to the top of the adapter. Just about ...
     came back into Jim's view. The only thing I wish
     is that I had more. This is the greatest experience
     I've ... it's just tremendous! Right now
     I'm standing on my head, and I'm looking right down,
     and it looks like we're coming up on the coast of
     California. I'm going into a slow rotation to the
     right. There is absolutely no disorientation associated
     with it.

[00:04:35:52]
C: One thing about it, when Ed gets out there and
     starts wiggling around, it sure makes the spacecraft
     tough to control.

[00:04:36:02]
P: I feel just about like a ... commercial.

[00:04:36:03]
CC: Is he taking pictures?

[00:04:36:11]
CC: Take some pictures.

[00:04:36:12]
P: Okay. I'm going to work on getting some pictures,
     Jim.

[00:04:36:14]
C: Okay. Get out in front where I can see you again.

[00:04:36:16]
P: Yes.

[00:04:36:18]
C: I've only got about three on the Hasselblad.

[00:04:36:20]
P: Okay.

[00:04:36:22]
C: Where are you?

[00:04:36:24]
P: Right out in front now. I don't have the control
     I had any more without that gun.

[00:04:36:28]
C: Yes, I noticed that.

[00:04:36:31]
P: On the tether.

CC: You've got about 5 minutes.

[00:04:36:33]
_page : 50
P: But I want to get out and shoot some good pictures.
     I'm not satisfied with that. Okay, I'm drifting
     down underneath the spacecraft.

[00:04:36:40]
C: Okay. I'm going to start firing the thrusters now.

[00:04:36:45]
P: All right. There's no difficulty in recontacting
     the spacecraft. It's all very soft, particularly
     as long as you move nice and slow. I'm very thankful
     to have the experience. It's great, Gus. Right
     now I'm right on top of the spacecraft - just above
     Jim's window. I'll bring myself in and put myself
     out into your view, Jim.

[00:04:37:09]
C: Okay. Hold it and I'll take your picture.

[00:04:37:24]
P: Right now I could maneuver much better if I didn't
     have the gun with the camera on it, because I have
     to tie one hand up with it.

[00:04:37:31]
C: Okay. Stay right there if you can.

[00:04:37:47]
C: Okay, do you want me to maneuver for you now, Ed?

[00:04:37:50]
P: No, I think you're doing fine. What I'd like to do
     is get all the way out, Jim, and get a picture of
     the whole spacecraft. I don't seem to be doing
     that.

[00:04:38:00]
C: Yes, I noticed that. You can't seem to get far
     enough away.

[00:04:38:02]
P: No.

[00:04:38:05]
C: Where are you now? Am I clear to thrust a little
     bit?

[00:04:38:07]
P: No, don't thrust now.

[00:04:38:12]
C: Okay. Ed, just free-float around. Right now we're
     pointing just about straight down at the ground.

[00:04:38:14]
P: Okay, now I'm taking a look back at the adapter and
     equipment back there. I can see the separation
     plane; it's quite clean. The thrusters are clean.
     The thermal paint, the thermal stripping looks quite
     good. Also, the velcro that we put on seems to be
     in good shape right by the camera. I'm coming back
     down on the spacecraft. I can sit up here and see
     the whole California coast.

[00:04:38:58]
P: Okay. Now I'm going to go out and see how much ...
     if I've got enough harness.

[00:04:39:26]
P: The sky sure is black.

[00:04:39:34]
_page : 51
C: Hey, Ed, can you see into the right-hand hatch,
     right now?

[00:04:39:37]
P: No.

[00:04:39:38]
C: Aw, shoot!

[00:04:39:41]
P: Let me work on back. Listen, it's all the difference
     in the world with this gun. When that gun was
     working, I was maneuvering all around.

[00:04:39:50]
C: ...

[00:04:39:52]
P: Yes. Okay.

[00:04:40:20]
P: ... contacted.

[00:04:40:22]
C: Yes.

[00:04:40:24]
P: How are you doing old buddy?

[00:04:40:26]
C: Pretty good. How about you?

[00:04:40:28]
P: Good. Looking right in your window.

[00:04:40:31]
C: Where? You're not even there. Are you there, Ed?

[00:04:40:32]
P: No, I'm moving out now.

[00:04:40:34]
C: Let me take a picture.

[00:04:40:53]
P: Okay, there I go. No. Boy, I sure could use that
     gun.

C: A pretty neat little contraption, huh?

[00:04:40:55]
P: Yes. All the strings that are attached to me tend
     to dampen out my travel on the lanyard.

[00:04:41:04]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.

[00:04:41:09]
C: Yes, I noticed that.

[00:04:41:10]
CC: You've got 4 minutes and 30 seconds left.

P: Okay, I'm going to free drift a little bit, and see
     if I can drift into some good picture-taking position.

[00:04:41:16]
C: Okay. Here, let me control the spacecraft ...

[00:04:41:33]
C: Just for your information Ed, we're only down to
     48 percent on our O<sub>2</sub>.

[00:04:41:38]
P: Okay.

[00:04:41:40]
C: ECS O<sub>2</sub> pressure is about 830, so it's staying right
     up there.

P: You know one thing about this. Where we have this
     tether attached, I can't get a good push off.

[00:04:41:52]
C: Oh yes, is that right? Where it's attached to you
     or where it's attached to the spacecraft?

[00:04:42:00]
P: Where it's attached to the spacecraft. There's
     nothing particularly to get a push off on. Now,
     let's see if I can get a decent push off. If I
     didn't have the gun I could do a little better.
     There just isn't anything to push on.

P: I'm looking right down your gun barrel. All right.

[00:04:42:28]
C: Let me take a closeup picture of you.

[00:04:42:30]
P: Okay. Just a minute.

[00:04:42:31]
C: You smeared up my windshield, you dirty dog!

[00:04:42:34]
P: Did I really?

[00:04:42:35]
C: Yes.

[00:04:42:37]
P: Well, hand me out a kleenex and I'll clean it.

[00:04:42:40]
C: Ha! See how it's all smeared up there?

[00:04:42:44]
P: Yes.

[00:04:42:45]
C: It looks like there is a coating on the outside and
     you've rubbed it off.

[00:04:42:47]
P: Yes.

[00:04:42:50]
C: That's exactly what you've done.

     1 deg/sec in pitch and yaw, and about 1/2 deg/sec
     in roll.

P: Yes.

P: No, not now. I'm out of it.

[00:04:44:00]
C: Which way?

[00:04:44:02]

P: Roger.

[00:04:47:12]
C: The spacecraft really looks like it's out-gassing
     because all the - whenever a little piece of dirt
     or something goes by it always heads for the door
     and goes right on out.

[00:04:47:26]

     can put in a 2 deg/sec attitude change in nothing
     flat! Can't you get a hold there, Ed?

[00:04:47:51]
P: Yeah ... now.

[00:04:47:56]
C: Okay.

P: It's no sweat. Actually, I'm trying to get a better
     picture.

C: Yes, we sort of talked about that. But we sort of
     talked about that but they didn't have any place
     for the camera. Come on, let's get back here before
     it gets dark.

P: Okay. This is the saddest moment of my life.

C: I know you are. I'm amazed. I never thought I'd
     see the day you would be so slow.

     times.

[00:05:20:24]

[00:05:20:26]
P: It's paid! Big dividends!

     just paid off. We could get the hatch closed.

     boys paid off.

     hurting it.

     it smeared the upper part of his windshield so that
     he couldn't see out. When I look out from this side,
     I can see that it is rather heavily coated with some
     type of material. When I was outside looking in, it
     looked like a - it looked like almost a greasy film
     on the outside of it. My window doesn't seem to have
     as much on it. When we have the sun on it...

P: It looks like in our power-down (illegible) we're
     still pulling just a little less than 11 amps.  We've
     got 10 on no. 1 and a little less than 11 on no. 2.
     The tether - the location of the tether or the umbilical
     restraint on the outside hatch made it
     rather difficult to do any EVA work as far as free
     tether aerodynamics out in front of the spacecraft.
     Whenever I'd be operating out in that area, the
     tether would - when it would come to its end would
     start me back and the reaction would carry me back
     up towards the - over the spacecraft and back toward
     the adapter section.  That's why I kept going out of
     sight during my maneuvering out there up above the
     windows, and then drifting back toward the back of
     the spacecraft. I continually had to keep pulling
     myself to get out in the front part of the spacecraft.
     I wasn't satisfied with the pictures that
     I was getting. It was rather difficult to keep
     any of the lanyards that I had on ... I had the
     lanyard on the gun and the tether and umbilical
     that I was on, and several other miscellaneous type
     lanyards flailing around and it was difficult to
     keep them from in front of the camera. You'll
     notice that perhaps in the pictures that I'll be
     moving my arms rapidly. I kept trying to move them
     out of the way so that I could take a picture. I'd
     say they were in front of me probably about 50 or
     60 percent of the time; and the other percent of the
     time I was not in as good a position as I would like
     to be. I think I probably took in the neighborhood
     of a dozen pictures. It does seem quite easy to
     operate, even just with the tether out there. I
     felt no tendency to bang into the spacecraft. I was
     able to approach the spacecraft just about from any
     attitude I came back in - and sometimes when I was
     coming ...

[00:06:15:18]
S: All right.

[00:06:15:41]
S: Ed, we don't see any cuff response yet.

[00:06:15:46]
P: I pumped it all the way up.

[00:06:15:49]
S: Does it feel firm to you?

[00:06:15:51]
P: Yes, quite firm. I'm ...

[00:06:15:56]
S: Okay, let her bleed, Ed.

[00:06:15:59]
P: Roger, and we'll pass it on to you now. I've had
     about 12 swallows of water and I think Jim probably
     had 10. Also, we haven't eaten anything yet and
     we're awfully hungry.

[00:06:16:16]
S: Real great. Listen Ed, we want to modify the Flight
     Plan and we would like to have the sleep period
     changed here and let you get some rest. We'd like
     to have you go for at least 4 hours right now and
     it's perfectly agreeable with Chris if we go ahead
     and have Jim sleep some of this period, too if he
     gets sleepy during that period. It's agreeable
     to Chris.

[00:06:16:45]
P: Understand you'd like me to go to sleep for a little
     while.

[00:06:16:49]
S: Roger. We'd like for you to go to sleep. For
     4 hours, anyway.

[00:06:16:54]
P: I'm not too sleepy; however, I'll ...

[00:06:16:59]
S: Okay, let's give it a try. Could I confirm one
     thing with you too, Ed? When you were EVA, we got
     a transmission that there was no disorientation,
     and that was affirmative for the entire time. Is
     that correct?

[00:06:17:14]
_page : 72
P: There was no disorientation whatsoever. I felt
     that I could either look down at the ground - I
     felt perfectly at home looking down at it - and I
     could roll around on my back and look up and it was
     not disorienting me in any way. The spacecraft was
     my best reference. Any time I saw it I immediately
     had a good reference and, in fact at times near the
     end I was using my tether and actually walking up
     and down on the surface of the spacecraft, using it
     to hold me down, as somewhat of an anchor.

[00:06:17:48]
S: Oh, that sounds terrific. Wonderful.

[00:06:17:52]
P: There just isn't any disorientation whatsoever.

[00:06:17:53]
S: Let's go on that sleep period. If Jim has no arguments
     about that, that's the end of the transmission
     here then.

[00:06:18:24]
CC: This is Cape. Go ahead 4.

[00:06:18:26]
CC: Go ahead 4.

[00:06:18:30]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.

[00:06:18:37]
C: Houston CAP COM. Gemini 4.

[00:06:18:39]
CC: Go ahead, Gemini 4.

[00:06:18:41]
C: I would like a little flight information here ...

[00:06:18:43]
CC: Roger.

[00:06:18:44]
C: Just what the plan is now with the fuel remaining,
     or how are we going to handle the fuel?

[00:06:18:52]
CC: As best as I can tell you right now, you'll be able
     to accomplish practically all of the Flight Plan
     with the fuel that you have remaining at this time.
     We'll keep updating you in real time. Right now
     we want you to get some sleep. As far as your
     Apollo D-9 goes, it looks like you're going to be
     too far from the booster.

[00:06:19:10]
C: Okay, if Ed sleeps, and if I see it, I'll go ahead
     and use the sextant.

[00:06:19:15]
CC: Right. If you do see it, you might unstow the
     sextant, but I wouldn't recommend you unstow it
     before you see it because it looks like you are
     going to be plenty far from it.

[00:06:19:22]
C: Okay, now I saw it on the last orbit so maybe I'll
     see it on the next one.

[00:06:19:28]
CC: Gemini 4, from Cape.

[00:06:19:30]
_page : 73
C: Go ahead Cape.

[00:06:19:31]
CC: Looks like we won one after all.

[00:06:19:33]
C: Ha! Ha!

[00:06:19:41]
CC: Gemini 4, from Houston Flight.

[00:06:19:45]
C: Go ahead Houston Flight, Gemini 4.

[00:06:19:47]
CC: Give us about a day to find the true anomaly, Jim,
     to see whether we can really do any of these OAMS
     retros. For instance 6-4, we didn't have enough
     fuel so there wouldn't have been any argument.

[00:06:19:58]
C: Okay, I'll go ahead and proceed with the Flight
     Plan as we've got it now. Is that correct?

[00:06:20:03]
CC: Affirmative.

[00:06:20:05]
C: Thank you.

[00:06:20:10]
C: We had a couple of pretty exciting moments there,
     Chris.

[00:06:20:12]
CC: Right.

[00:06:22:41]
CC: Gemini 4.

[00:06:22:53]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.

[00:06:23:07]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.

[00:06:23:18]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.

[00:06:23:24]
P: Go ahead, Gemini 4.

[00:06:23:26]
CC: We want to verify if you're off the long umbilical
     and back on your normal suit circuit.

[00:06:23:32]
P: That's affirmative. We've been off the long umbilical
     for some time. At that time we went off
     the umbilical onto the suit ECS circuit.

[00:06:23:45]
CC: Roger. Have a good nap.

[00:06:23:47]
P: Roger.

[00:06:23:55]
C: Houston CAP COM, this is Gemini 4.

[00:06:24:04]
C: Houston CAP COM, Gemini 4.

[00:06:24:05]
CC: Go ahead Gemini 4.

[00:06:24:07]
C: I never did understand what ECS O<sub>2</sub> switch you
     wanted me to turn off.

[00:06:24:12]
CC: Roger. It's the ECS O<sub>2</sub> heater switch. Heater
     switch.

[00:06:24:17]
_page : 74
C: How come you want that off?

[00:06:24:23]
CC: ... says we won't need it anymore. The pressure
     will sustain itself.

[00:06:24:27]
C: Okay, fine. We're still up about 42 percent.

[00:06:24:28]
CC: Roger, you're reading 42 percent.

[00:06:34:35]
C: It's now 6+35 elapsed, and I'm powering down the
     spacecraft completely. We had turned off the platform
     and the computer earlier after checking with
     ground and completing our EVA. I'm powering down
     the rest of it at this time.

[00:06:36:47]
P: I'm turning Biomed Recorder no. 1 off at this time.
     This is a change from the Flight Plan due to the
     different sleeping arrangements.

[00:06:37:27]
P: Okay, Blackie.

[00:06:37:29]
C: Ha! Ha! Ha! What are we going to do with all this
     stuff?

[00:06:37:32]
P: I don't know.

[00:06:37:40]
C: ... ES sensor ... ?

[00:06:37:44]
P: Yep. Let's turn it off, too.

[00:06:37:47]
C: Let's turn it off.

[00:06:37:49]
P: The ES sensor is coming off at this time.

[00:06:38:06]
P: I think we ought to make a big effort to get a
     full meal at this time, Jim.

[00:06:38:11]
C: I think so. I'm about starved to death.

[00:06:38:14]
P: Ha! Ha! Bacon and egg bites.

[00:06:38:18]
C: Oh?

[00:06:38:19]
P: Yes. Ha! Ha! Ha!

[00:06:38:23]
C: For me, too?

[00:06:38:24]
P: Ha! Ha! Ha! Yes.

[00:06:38:27]
C: ...

[00:06:38:29]
P: Can you keep all that stuff on ... ?

[00:06:38:44]
P: I swear, I get the feeling I'm standing on my head
     here.

[00:06:38:50]
C: Yes, me too.

[00:06:38:54]
P: Maybe it's because you're always touching the
     ceiling.

[00:06:38:56]
_page : 75
C: Yes.

[00:06:39:05]
P: Good boy! You putting some log data in?

[00:06:39:07]
C: Yes.

[00:06:39:08]
P: Back up that tape?

[00:06:41:04]
C: Continuing what I was debriefing about the booster,
     early in the flight. After we entered the darkness,
     at what I consider to be a distance of 1200 feet,
     I tried station-keeping with it, but the only thing
     I had to judge my distance from the booster at that
     time was the distance between the flashing lights.
     Occasionally they would - not occasionally, but
     continually, I would see one light, then two lights,
     and then one light, and then sometimes there'd be
     a long time before I'd see two lights - indicating
     that the booster was rotating all the time. I
     really didn't have too much of a clue as to which
     way it was going. Based on the distance between
     the lights, when I could see both of them, I felt
     that I was in a real good position with it until
     we got to about Carnarvon. At that time I seemed
     to be closing rather rapidly, although I couldn't
     really be sure of this. All the ΔV I'd added up
     to that time had been in the direction of the
     booster, or retrograde. Unfortunately, the darned
     booster would get in position such that if I were
     going to close on it, I would have to apply a posigrade
     to close, which then, in turn, caused me to
     once again depart from it after a period of time
     had gone by. Then with the 45 - 40 minutes of
     darkness, I really had a difficult time telling
     where I was. As we came out of the darkness, the
     booster was below me and pulling away from me quite
     rapidly. Ed, how far away below us do you think it
     was?

[00:06:43:01]
P: Oh, I don't know. I'd estimate it was probably out
     there a mile and a half or two.

[00:06:43:06]
C: Yes.

P: It's very difficult to estimate when it gets to be
     that far.

[00:06:43:08]
C: It certainly was. I sort of felt that it was probably
     between one and two miles, and I couldn't
     really tell how far out.

[00:06:43:18]
_page : 76
C: Definitely below me. I'd been tracking it below
     me from about Carnarvon on. Up until about
     Carnarvon we had it below us, and then up to the
     horizon, and then down below us again. It almost
     looked like it was in a different orbit than I was.
     It had a different apogee and perigee than what I
     did. Anyway, I attempted to close with it at daylight
     as soon as I could tell where it was. As I
     said, at that time it was a mile or two out in
     front of me - down below me. So, the more I tried
     to close, the less I really gained on it. I was
     firing retrograde. I was using my top thrusters
     to fire in such a manner as to decrease my total
     velocity, and then firing ... at the same time.
     I never really closed, and it continued to pull
     away from me. It became obvious to me that by the
     time we got to Hawaii that to close on the booster
     in time to do the EVA with the booster would probably
     take all the fuel we had onboard. In the
     ground rule we had agreed not to do this. So I
     checked with CAP COM and we decided to not go ahead
     with the booster portion of the mission. I don't
     know if I mentioned it, but when we separated from
     the booster, it seemed like our rates on the booster
     were low, on the order of a half a degree a second
     in pitch and yaw. I tried to damp these. I fired
     one impulse in each direction, and then I concentrated
     on coming off the booster. We came off, and
     we came off in the manner in which we generated
     some other rates. We came right-side-up, eventually,
     and turned around. Probably about a minute and a
     half or two minutes. It looked like the big problem
     was the time I took out to semi-aline the platform
     before we went into the dark side. We'd probably
     gotten right on top of the booster instantaneously.
     If I'd ignored the platform we would have been able
     to go ahead and complete it. On the other hand, I
     wanted to make sure we had a reasonably good alinement
     prior to getting to our 2-1 GO-NO GO point in
     case anything went wrong.

[00:06:46:04]
C: What's that? Gum?

[00:06:46:06]
P: Yes.

[00:06:46:08]
_page : 77
C: As the booster departed us, you could see the fuel
     spraying out of the roll nozzle. As the booster
     tumbled around, mostly in a plane that would be
     perpendicular to a line through the major axis of
     the spacecraft to the booster, you could see the
     long flowing tail that came out of it. I'm going
     to draw a short little picture of that on my flight
     plan. There was debris all over at spacecraft
     separation. We turned around and there were things
     all over the place. As a matter of fact, until we
     really got a good look at the booster, I really
     couldn't tell what was what. Fairings came off
     right at fairing jett with no problem. The horizon
     scanner fairings looked like they came off intact
     but I couldn't really tell because it disappeared
     out of sight so last. I didn't see the nose fairing
     come off at all.

[00:06:47:36]
C: I never did get an accelerometer bias to check on
     the platform. I was thrusting most of the time
     there, and unable to really settle the thing down
     for any length of time. We skipped a couple tape
     dumps I guess, because of the peculiar attitude
     that we were in. I could not contact Carnarvon
     very well on the first pass. It's a shame we
     didn't have a camera out right when we separated
     because ...

[00:06:48:33]
P: Boy! That was beautiful.

[00:06:48:40]
C: Nice. What? g?

[00:06:48:42]
P: No. That first view of that booster.

[00:06:48:45]
C: Oh yes. That was really nice, wasn't it?

P: That was beautiful.

[00:06:48:46]
C: That was really nice all right.

[00:06:48:50]
C: Just the way it should have been.

[00:06:48:51]
P: Just exactly!

[00:06:48:52]
C: How far out do you think we were when we first
     saw it? I think we must have been at least
     500 feet out when we first got around.

[00:06:48:57]
P: Oh, we were closer than that.

[00:06:48:58]
C: Do you think so?

[00:06:48:59]
P: Oh yes. I'd say we were in the neighborhood of ...

[00:06:49:02]
C: Remember, it's only ...

[00:06:49:04]
_page : 78
C: It's 130 feet long - the whole thing, I mean. Just
     as a reference, from the pad to our spacecraft was
     only about 130 feet long.

[00:06:49:13]
P: Yes.

[00:06:49:14]
C: Okay.

[00:06:49:18]
P: I'd estimate we were out about a little over
     200 feet.

[00:06:49:20]
C: Think so?

[00:06:49:21]
P: Yes.

[00:06:49:22]
C: Okay, I would estimate ...

P: Boy, it was sitting right out there!

[00:06:49:23]
C: ... between five and six hundred feet, but
     certainly close enough where you could see it in
     all its clarity.

[00:06:49:28]
P: Going away and the tumbling was starting.

[00:06:49:30]
C: Right. It didn't take long for that tumbling to
     get going.

[00:06:49:35]
P: Interesting thing, though. The tumbling, really,
     as I could see, never appreciably picked up. It
     stayed there. It started out ...

[00:06:49:42]
C: You know what it looked like to me?

[00:06:49:44]
P: What?

[00:06:49:45]
C: It looked like it was tumbling in an oscillatory
     manner. It would tumble for a while and then it
     looked like, as it burped or the fuel came out or
     something, it would change its orientation and
     pull over in another way.

[00:06:49:56]
P: Yes, but it never seemed to go ... I timed
     them ... looked like ...

[00:06:49:59]
C: The rates ... Yes, the total rate never really
     seemed to pick up good in whatever it was. What
     was it? Eight seconds/rev?

[00:06:50:05]
P: Eight seconds/revolution. I timed them.

[00:06:50:06]
C: Okay. Let me write that down so we don't forget it.

[00:06:50:10]
C: Starting over the United States, actually Ed started
     unstowing things just as soon as we got into orbit.
     I think that we could unstow without jeopardizing
     the possibility of a safe 2-1 reentry.

[00:06:51:01]
_page : 79
P: What's that down there below us? Over there.

[00:06:51:06]
C: Looks like a city or something.

[00:06:51:11]
P: Are we upside-down?

[00:06:51:13]
C: I think we're pointing right down at the ground.

[00:06:51:18]
C: Ed started on unstowing stuff and as soon as we got
     to the position where it became no longer feasible
     to fool with the booster, I started full-time
     helping him - at least holding the things and stowing
     them away and trying to keep them from disappearing.
     The faster we worked the farther behind we
     got. Not because we weren't putting things the way
     they were supposed to, it just took a lot longer
     than we had anticipated. It really wasn't much
     easier at zero g than it was in the simulator, if
     as easy. So we worked all the way around. By the
     time we got to Carnarvon, I had made up my mind
     that we couldn't make it, but I thought we'd forge
     on a little longer. By the time we got to - or
     just before we even left Carnarvon it was clear to
     me that we could not make the depressurization. I
     called for a slip to the next orbit. We then ...
     caught our breath for about 20 minutes and tried to
     sort out the junk I had laying around in the cockpit.
     Then I got the checklist out and we went
     through the checklist again in detail to make sure
     that we hadn't skipped anything in the rush. Started
     the extravehicular - got the GO over Carnarvon.
     We were all set to go and we were standing by for
     the GO to start depressurizing. We got it. Went
     through the depressurization cycle. As we left
     Carnarvon, we were cleared for the full EVA. We
     got to Canton or Hawaii, and at that time were
     given - I believe it was Canton or Hawaii that gave
     us the GO to actually exit the spacecraft and start
     the extravehicular maneuvers. We accomplished this
     as indicated on our tape recorder that we recorded
     before and on the VOX position. We went ahead and
     Ed got out and we started to take pictures as we -
     how we would ... I initially held the spacecraft
     fixed for him. Then as he got out and seemed to be
     floating around in such a manner that I couldn't
     track him - initially, we decided that it was better
     to let the thing drift. Is that right?

[00:06:54:25]
P: That's right.

C: He was having difficulty maintaining his orientation,
     and it looked to me from then on he oriented
     off the spacecraft without regard to which direction
     it was pointing. He could actually impart quite
     high rates to it, as high as 2° per second. I intended
     to keep them below that level. As he got
     back into the spacecraft, we had a considerable
     amount of difficulty with the hatch. First we
     lifted the ratchet portion of the hatch to engage.
     After we got that engaged, we couldn't get the
     hatch down closed far enough. Actually, we started
     pulling down on the locking handles to get the dogs
     out. So, we had a rather exciting time and I think
     it was on tape, wasn't it Ed? I had the tape recorder
     on, I believe.

[00:06:55:24]
_page : 80
P: The tape recorder was on, but the red light lit
     there sometime. I don't know.

[00:06:55:26]
C: Okay. So it may be on tape and it may not. It went
     on for - I think we were 44 minutes after we started
     EVA. I was looking at my event timer which I had
     started when Ed exited the spacecraft. At 44 minutes
     we still didn't have the hatch closed. We were
     trying to take things calm, cool, and collected so
     we didn't get things all screwed up. And finally,
     by my pulling as hard as I could to get the hatch
     closing device, and Ed pulling down as best as he
     could, we were able to force him down into the seat
     and get the hatch closed fully. Ed seemed to be up
     much higher today than he had been in any of our
     zero-g EVA in the airplane.

[00:06:56:13]
P: Jim. I don't think it was the ...

[00:06:56:17]
C: Go ahead. Say what you said.

[00:06:56:20]
P: Yes. I don't believe we were actually having difficulty
     with the head clearance. I felt like I had
     plenty of head clearance and I could actually ...
     down and manipulate the dogs. We just seemed to have
     a little more effort in closing than we had ever experienced
     before and ...

[00:06:56:40]
C: It was difficult to swing shut because of all the
     washers that we have in the pyro lines.

[00:06:57:00]
_page : 81
P: Right. I was having to actually manipulate the
     gain dogs on the hatch each time that I stroked it,
     so that I wasn't able to pull as hard as I usually
     had been able to.  So we had to coordinate ourselves
     and where I would stroke down on it.  Jim would - I
     would instruct him to pull hard at that time and I 
     know he was. In that manner we were able to get it
     started. Once these dogs started dogging down I
     had no trouble with the gain anymore, but I had to
     actually engage the gain as we had been instructed
     on the first several strokes to get it started down.

[00:06:57:30]
C: One thing that I don't know if we got on tape before,
     but both Ed and I mentioned that we were quite thankful
     for all the training that we'd done in the altitude
     chamber, in the zero-g airplane, and the crew
     procedures trainer there at Houston.

[00:06:57:43]
P: You're not kidding! I'll second that. The things
     that occurred were not things that we hadn't done
     before and things that we hadn't worked out procedures
     for before. The things that we did, I
     think, paid very heavy dividends today. I was very
     thankful for all the training that we had and the
     work the people had done with us.

[00:06:58:01]
C: Yes. I was thankful that we didn't have to make a
     reentry with the hatch open.

[00:06:58:06]
P: And another thing, I was glad Jim had been working
     with the dumbells a little bit to build up those
     muscles.

[00:07:00:46]

P: On the books, I think we want to be sure we put a
     little more care into the kind of rings we use.
     We've had difficulty in opening two or three different
     times now, and also pages are tearing out so
     that they are not staying in the book. We ought to
     look into some kind of reinforcement for the holes,
     where the rings attach. On the water gun, the little
     teat that sticks out the end of it to allow the water
     to flow out sticks in the OUT position, just like it
     did on the simulator, and allows water to flow after
     you take the trigger off. You have to, actually,
     from time to time reseat it back up in there to keep
     the water from flowing out of the capsule when you
     pull the gun out of the food package. Another thing,
     on the drinking hose, it's very easy to turn the hose
     in such an angle when you're drinking from it to keep
     the water from flowing through the hose. Actually,
     you crimp the hose right at the end, right where the
     rubber attaches to the drinking nozzle gun.

     taking several pictures for S-5. I'm right in the
     area of the tropical storm Carla. It's very heavily
     overcast right now. I'll take a few of the cloud
     formations. They have some very interesting formations
     interlaced on the top of them. Perhaps the
     camera will pick them up. It's so bright I'm going
     to shoot 250 at 16. Those will be frames 28, 29,
     and I'll be shooting at least two more. Those will

P: I'm looking out at the stars now. it's not as -
     it's light, not fully dark. It appears that the
     window gives you a filter that cuts down the smaller
     magnitude stars. I'm looking out right now at the
     Big Dipper and right on down to Arcturus and ... 
     and it appears to me that what I'm seeing right now
     are primarily the second and down to third order
     stars. The smaller ones are cut pretty well out of
     the picture at the present time. As you get deeper
     into night, I think more of them will come out, but
     you definitely don't see as many stars as you do
     flying at 40 000 feet in an airplane on a good clear
     night.

[00:12:30:59]
P: The stars of Corvus is right out in view right now.
     It seems to be in pretty full view. I'm picking up
     probably down to about fourth order stars right now.

[00:12:33:45]
P: As we get deeper into the night, the other stars are
     coming out. I can see them - I believe I can see
     down to about fifth magnitude now. It's still not
     as brilliant a display of stars as you'd see on a
     clear night at 20 000 feet out of the canopy of an
     aircraft. I've got my lights dimmed way down and it
     makes a much more spectacular view out. As a matter
     of fact, the stars seem to be coming out as my eyes
     adapt further. I'm looking right now at the Southern
     Cross and the stars around it. There seems to
     be a somewhat of a lighted area around it.

[00:12:35:11]
P: I've got a very clear horizon now. It's rather
     light and I've got a horizon comprised mainly of
     clouds. I can see the clouds - the stars as they
     start to go down into the main air glow, but the
     clouds seem to give a more light horizon. It doesn't
     seem that we - earlier in the flight we've seen a
     horizon without clouds and it was much more - it was
     a rather thick layer of air glow and you could see
     the stars as they went down through it. In this
     cloud-type horizon though, the stars are more difficult
     to see; although I do note that some of the
     brighter ones are visible through it as they set.

     the whole state of Florida, and we went ... and
     about that time we had the command to start back in.

[00:12:41:04]
CC: Sounds real good.

[00:12:41:07]
P: Quite a view!

[00:12:41:13]
P: Also relay down that control with the gun was ...
     very good in yaw, very good in pitch. Roll control
     wasn't as good but when I had the gun, I was able to
     pick a spot on the spacecraft and return to it. I
     was able to maneuver in translation and also in my
     attitude control ...

[00:12:41:39]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[00:12:41:41]
_page : 100
P: ... I didn't have the gun though, using the lanyard
     was a little more difficult due to the position on
     the spacecraft door at which it was attached. It
     tended to - like a tether will do, it tended to bring
     me back and rebound me off the ... door back toward
     the adapter quite a bit of the time, and I spent a
     lot of time trying to get out of that area.

[00:12:42:05]
CC: Roger.

[00:12:42:22]
P: ... I finished the dinner of roast beef ...

[00:12:42:35]
CC: Roger, very good. Flight has been copying your
     transmissions.

[00:12:42:41]
P: Roger. Understand.

[00:12:42:57]
P: Looking at it now, right now. It's a ... triangle.
     I can see all three constellations, I think, clearly.
     The ... and Vega. In fact, I can see down ...

[00:12:43:37]
CC: Roger, sounds real good.

[00:12:43:44]
P: ... pictures.

[00:12:46:44]
P: I've seen quite a display of stars ... I've seen
     the southern hemisphere stars. I've seen the Summer
     Triangle, ... Vega, the Northern Cross. Looks
     like now I'm coming up - I can see ... I can see
     the ...

[00:12:52:12]
P: I believe that I miscalled a little earlier on the
     - that I had a cloud-deck horizon. I definitely
     don't have a ground-deck horizon. I can see down
     below thunderstorm activity and the stars sinking
     down through the air glow. So it's definitely an
     air glow horizon. And I estimate it to be approximately
     11 to 12° angle, pie section, from my view.
     There's quite a display of thunderstorms down below
     right now.

[00:12:52:46]
P: It's starting to get light and I can still see quite
     a few stars. I'm going to try to see just what
     chance I have of seeing stars on the sunlit side of
     this pass.

[00:12:57:36]
P: Well, I'm back around now to the Southern Cross with
     the light splotchy area of - I guess lots of very
     light ... stars. I don't recall quite seeing the
     same display in the planetarium. Alpha Centauri and
     Beta are quite clear. I'm still at this time - it's
     starting to get light and I can still see quite a
     few stars. I believe they go down to about at least
     the sixth order now. I started up about the fourth
     and I'm down to sixth. There's really a lot of
     stars out in that ...

[00:12:59:00]
_page : 101
P: The light band of stars seem to - the stars right
     around the Southern Cross and the rather dark void
     area and the right - on the sign of the Cross and
     that as you get back toward Alpha and Beta Centauri
     the light area continues. It just looks ... a big
     patch of - oh, it looks like we're going to be late.

[00:12:59:32]
P: It looks just as ... It looks just like ...
     As a matter of fact, it probably is. It certainly
     is clearly defined, though. You can see the dark
     voids - a dark void area, ... in it.

[00:13:00:58]
P: There's the little Corona Australis, that we decided
     to use as a calibration. It's out in front of me
     right now, and they go down to fifth order stars and
     I can see stars that are distinctly of a less magnitude
     than the stars in the Corona Australis.

[00:13:03:31]
P: MSC-2 and -3 are being turned OFF at 04 19 40. I'm
     afraid I was watching the stars so much I forgot to
     turn it off at the proper time.

[00:13:05:30]
P: Right now it's daylight over on Jim's side, and
     looking out my side I can still make out some of
     the stars. It appears that you can keep the spacecraft
     oriented so that one side is dark. On the
     dark side you can see stars: but the other side is
     in daylight. Jim's side is definitely in the daylight
     right now and mine is in the dark. This is
     one of the things that surprised me the most earlier
     in the flight when I was looking out at all the
     little fireflies from the booster, and remarking how
     dark it was and how it looked. I looked over at Jim
     and he was looking out of the perfectly daylight
     window. That's actually the way it's supposed to be
     but was a quite interesting thing - the first time
     you see it.

[00:13:15:02]
P: I just took an S-5 picture. I'm just coming over the
     Sahara Desert. It's really a beautiful view. I'll
     take several more pictures.

[00:13:17:05]
P: I took two pictures - 45 and 46. I'm passing over
     Africa now, looking down at the Sahara Desert.

     11-BRAVO?

[00:15:26:53]
CC: Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. I'm not reading
     you. I will read 11-BRAVO once more in the blind.

     read me? Over.

[00:15:47:30]
S: Gemini 4, RKV Surgeon. Understand blood pressure.
     Give me a mark on your exercise.

[00:15:47:36]
C: Roger.

[00:15:47:44]
C: MARK!

[00:15:48:14]
C: Blood pressure is coming.

[00:15:48:30]
S: Full scale.

[00:15:49:14]
S: ... blood pressure standing by for your food, water
     ...

[00:15:49:20]
C: Roger.

[00:15:50:00]
C: I feel quite rested now, although I wasn't really
     able to get any good sleep. I had two meals. I had
     breakfast right after we got through with our EVA
     exercise and while Ed was sleeping. Then I had
     another meal, meal B. In the first meal I didn't
     eat the bacon and egg bites. In the second meal I
     think I've eaten all of it. After I woke up I had
     10 swallows of water.

[00:15:50:30]
C: Roger. I've had 10 swallows of water since I woke
     up probably ... before I went to sleep.

[00:15:50:45]
S: Roger. Any other comments?

[00:15:50:49]
_page : 110
C: We managed to get the urine system, urine bags dumped,
     and we're in pretty good shape ...

[00:15:50:58]
S: Roger.

[00:15:51:00]
C: Roger, be advised that so far we've had to avoid ...
     any water floating around the cabin. I think that
     we're doing pretty well where we are.

[00:15:51:12]
CC: Roger. This is RKV CAP COM. I have an update for
     photographic purposes on the eleventh revolution.

[00:15:51:20]
C: Roger. Stand by one.

[00:15:51:27]
C: Okay, go ahead with your update.

[00:15:51:29]
CC: Roger. Typhoon Babe, G.m.t. 07:56, south of Hong
     Kong. It will be north of the ground track.

[00:15:51:49]
C: Roger, 07:56 we will see north of the ground track,
     Typhoon Babe.

[00:15:51:57]
C: Is that correct?

[00:15:52:00]
CC: Roger. That's affirmative. This will be south of
     Hong Kong.

[00:15:52:05]
C: Roger. South of Hong Kong.

[00:15:52:06]
CC: Roger, also have 11-BRAVO update for you.

[00:15:52:11]
C: Stand by a minute.

[00:15:52:17]

[00:15:52:43]

[00:15:52:50]
C: RKV, Gemini 4. Give us our ΔV again. Say it again.

[00:15:53:00]
CC: 183.

[00:15:53:05]
C: Okay, Gemini 4, reading back 11-BRAVO 183. 3+57. 07 58 59. 
     09+30.

[00:15:53:15]
CC: Roger, roger, roger.

[00:16:21:20]
C: ... over Africa I took one picture ... I think
     that was exposure no. 53 in the Hasselblad magazine.

[00:16:22:08]
C: Now we're over the Mediterranean. It is very easy
     to recognize. I see a couple of very large ships.
     They start off from Beirut. We should be passing
     just south of Beirut.

[00:16:30:06]
_page : 111
C: I just took a picture. Frame no. 14 on the Contarex
     the same film pack we used for the EVA. There's the
     start of a long area of clouds. It appears to be
     cut-off between the desert area and the mountainous
     area that extends over China.

[00:16:39:28]
P: Now it's 07:55 and 1/2. I shot off the Contarex,
     trying to get Hurricane Babe. It wasn't very successful.
     The hurricane itself isn't very prevalent.
     Looks like another group of clouds.

[00:17:20:35]
C: Gemini 4. How do you read?

[00:17:20:37]
CC: Roger, I read you loud and clear. How me?

[00:17:20:40]
C: Loud and clear.

[00:17:20:41]
CC: Roger, it's the clearest it's been.

[00:17:20:45]
C: Yes. It's very nice talking to people I can understand.
     It doesn't happen very often.

[00:17:20:49]
CC: Roger.

[00:17:20:50]
CC: I have a Flight Plan update for you, for ground
     elapsed time of 19 hours going on to 22 hours.

[00:17:21:00]
C: Roger. Go ahead.

[00:17:21:01]
CC: Roger, on Rev 12 RKV will update your PLA and CLA
     time; Rev 13 Canary Islands will have a C-band track.
     And also there will be astro-orbital nav check-run.
     No propellant usage for ATTITUDE control. This is
     a g.e.t, of ... or a G.m.t. time of 12 hours
     16 minutes 00 seconds. Rev 13 tape dump over
     Carnarvon. After Carnarvon pass go to normal Flight
     Plan except when changes are required. Did you copy?

[00:17:22:02]
C: Roger, understand, at hours 18 to 22. On Rev 12 over
     RKV I will be updated with my PLA and CLA. Rev 13
     over Canary will have a C-band track. At a G.m.t. of 12 16 00,
     I can do some orbit nav providing it
     requires no fuel. On Rev 13 I will have a tape dump
     over Carnarvon and I'll begin a normal Flight Plan
     after that time. Is that correct?

[00:17:22:35]
CC: Roger. That is correct. Everything still looks real
     good to us on the ground.

[00:17:22:41]
C: Roger, it looks pretty good up here, too.

[00:17:22:44]
CC: Roger, it would.

[00:17:22:45]
C: I think I've looked at the earth from every conceivable
     angle over the last 6 or 8 hours.

[00:17:22:50]
_page : 112
CC: Yes, I can imagine.

[00:17:22:53]
C: Do you have some updates for us as far as PLA and
     CLA at this time?

[00:17:22:58]
CC: Negative. We won't get that until the next rev.

[00:17:23:01]
C: Okay, fine.

[00:17:23:03]
C: It is really good to talk to somebody that I can
     understand and somebody that can hear me.

[00:17:23:08]
CC: Roger, we are kind of in the same shape, here,
     sitting out in this boat. We have a little trouble
     getting communications with the rest of the world.

[00:17:23:16]
C: Okay, we'll get around to talking to each other for
     a minute because I can't talk to them either.

[00:17:23:22]
CC: Roger.

[00:17:23:27]
CC: How's the sleeping going up there, floating around?

[00:17:23:31]
C: Actually it doesn't go too well because unfortunately
     we don't have any way of shutting off the radio. So
     that when we are talking like this, Ed can hear you
     and I; although he has his volume down, I'm sure he
     hears us right now. And it's awfully cramped. We
     got all this extra equipment on board that we'd hoped
     to dump out and it is really crowded.

[00:17:23:51]
CC: Yeah, man!

[00:17:23:55]
CC: It seems like it would be kind of soft sleeping, without
     any weight or anything.

[00:17:23:59]
C: It is, but you still are restricted to a certain position
     just like sitting in a bus seat. Although
     you don't sit on your fanny, you still have to sit
     in the same shape.

[00:17:24:10]
CC: Yes, I can imagine.

[00:17:24:35]
CC: Gemini 4, Flight asks how are you doing as far as
     getting things stowed away and if you are getting a
     little crowded up there.

[00:17:24:43]
C: Yes, indeed. We are crowded. We have most of that
     junk down in our foot well, and I guess we are going
     to have to hold some of it during reentry.

[00:17:24:53]
CC: Oh boy! That sounds like a lot of fun.

[00:17:25:00]
_page : 113
C: So far our major problem aside from the hatch and a
     few other exciting moments is trying to figure out
     what to do with all the stuff we've got.

[00:17:25:09]
CC: Yes. Well, let's see, there's a lot of empty space
     out there around you.

[00:17:25:19]
C: Yes, and I sure wish I could get to it.

[00:17:25:20]
CC: Yes, I imagine.

[00:17:25:39]
CC: Flight advises that they have very good communications
     on this air-to-ground remoting and would like
     you to go over the problem you had with the hatch
     closure.

[00:17:25:48]
C: Roger. There are two gears that we have that go
     around when you pull the handle back and forth. One
     of them is the gear that sort of acts as a ratchet,
     a little cylinder with a piston in it and a spike
     behind it that engages the ratchet. And we were
     having a little trouble with that before we got it
     open and after we got it open we had difficulty
     getting this ratchet to work. Also, we had a great
     deal of difficulty getting the hatch closed far
     enough so that we could even start latching it.
     Then, Ed had to push the ratchet in with his hand
     on every go until we got the thing started. And I
     was pulling on the thing until I thought probably
     I was going to break a lug right out of the hatch.
     And we finally got it going, and it finally came
     forward. So I don't think we ought to try opening
     it up anymore.

[00:17:26:43]
CC: Yes, Roger. Sounds like a good idea to keep it
     closed.

[00:17:26:47]
C: Rog. I'm not sure what the trouble was when we got
     down close but I tell you one thing, I'm glad that
     we spent so much time training in closing - opening
     and closing hatches.

[00:17:26:58]
CC: Yes, all that extra training sure pays off at times.

[00:17:27:17]
CC: Roger, Gemini 4. We're coming up on LOS here shortly.
     Anything else?

[00:17:27:37]
CC: Gemini 4, RKV.

[00:17:40:50]
P: I just took a picture on the Hasselblad, Frame 54.
     A picture of cloud streaks over the South Atlantic
     ...

[00:17:43:42]
_page : 114
P: Frame 55 on the Hasselblad just as we came on to
     Africa. We had a very good high altitude cloud
     streak, it looked like - so I took another picture
     of the high altitude ones.

[00:17:45:04]
P: Over Africa now. I just took Frame 56 on the
     Hasselblad. It was a topographic feature. It looked
     like it had been an old volcano at one time and you
     could see the concentric circles on the top of where
     it had erupted a number of times or the way it
     eroded. 09:01.

[00:17:48:20]
P: ... Film Pack no. 11 on the Hasselblad and no. 7
     on the ...

[00:18:00:21]
C: I just saw the booster in the sunlight, at a distance
     I would estimate of 50 miles or so. Time is 09:16
     and 1/2.

[00:18:01:10]
C: I don't know which way I was pointing when I saw the
     booster. Can't see the ground at the present time.

C: Roger RKV, you broke up. I only got the first part
     and the last part of your message here.

[00:18:55:25]
CC: Roger. I read you loud and clear now.

[00:18:55:28]
C: Same here.

[00:18:55:29]
CC: Roger, I've got a whole lot of things to pass up to
     you.

CC: We would like you to switch your ADAPTER C-band
     beacon switch to the CONTINUOUS position at 11 52 43.

[00:19:53:44]
C: Roger, C-band ADAPTER SWITCH to CONTINUOUS at 11 52 43.

[00:19:53:54]
CC: That's affirmative. We would like you to come back
     to COMMAND at 11 59 23.

[00:19:54:07]

[00:19:54:11]
CC: Affirmative.

[00:19:54:21]
C: I have a question, Carnarvon, it looks like we're
     getting back on the fuel line and then we are going
     to do the rest of the Flight Plan as originally
     scheduled. Is that correct?

[00:19:54:29]
CC: Roger, that's affirmative.

[00:19:54:32]
C: Okay, my Flight Plan shows me going to sleep then at
     the elapsed time of about 20:30 or so. Does that
     still hold true?

[00:19:54:42]
CC: That is affirmative.

[00:19:54:43]
C: Okay.

[00:19:54:59]
C: At the elapsed time of 22 hours we will take up the
     Flight Plan again. We will be back on the fuel curve
     at that time. Correct?

[00:19:55:07]
CC: Affirmative.

[00:19:55:08]
C: Okay.

[00:20:25:56]
P: Oh, and I was also - can you hear me?

[00:20:26:00]
C: Yes.

[00:20:26:20]
P: Okay, I am switching the biomed recorders now from

P: Sextant.

[00:20:27:14]

     please put the oral thermometer in his mouth.

[00:21:23:53]
CC: Gemini 4, Carnarvon.

[00:21:23:57]
P: Go ahead, Carnarvon. Gemini 4.

[00:21:23:59]
S: Roger. Will the pilot please put the oral thermometer
     in his mouth?

[00:21:24:03]
P: Roger. Affirmative. I have the oral thermometer in
     the mouth. Do you want me to keep it closed for a
     few minutes so you can get a temperature?

[00:21:24:23]
CC: Okay. You can start pumping up the Pilot's blood
     pressure, and leave the thermometer in your mouth.
     Don't acknowledge.

[00:21:25:34]
CC: Cuff's full-scale. Okay Gemini 4, we have enough
     oral temp. Stand by for the Aero-Med.

[00:21:25:50]
S: This is Carnarvon Surgeon. Your blood pressure is
     coming ...

[00:21:26:56]
P: Gemini 4. Be advised the exerciser is over on the
     Command Pilot's side right now. I believe he's in
     a pretty good sleep. I'd prefer not to disturb
     him. Could I swap you this off and give you one
     when he wakes up?

[00:21:27:13]
S: This is the Surgeon. Say again. Is this the Pilot
     speaking?

[00:21:27:17]
P: Roger. That's affirmative ... The exerciser is
     over on the Command Pilot's side and he's asleep,
     I believe ...

[00:21:27:26]
S: Understand. Disregard the exercise at this time.
     Would you tell me what you've had to eat, sleep,
     and drink.

[00:21:27:36]
P: Say again, please.

[00:21:27:38]
S: How about an eat, water, and sleep report, please?

[00:21:27:41]
P: I had a very deep sleep and I woke up when the ...
     changed from two to one and then I switched it back
     to two and I went back to sleep again for at least
     2 and 1/2 hours. I did not ... Jim had to actually
     blow reveille for me to get up.

[00:21:28:10]
_page : 119
S: You say you woke up an hour ago. What time did you
     go to sleep, please?

[00:21:28:20]
P: I was asleep 1 hour and I woke up at 11:30.

[00:21:28:25]
S: Was that 4 hours sleep at 11:30?

[00:21:28:30]
P: That's affirmative ... that was 11:30 and I'd
     been asleep for approximately 4 hours.

[00:21:28:40]
S: Have you had anything to eat?

[00:21:28:41]
P: No, I haven't eaten since I went to bed - just before
     I went on to sleep. I have had about 6 swallows of
     water since I got up and I drank ...

[00:21:28:57]
S: You haven't eaten Meal D? Meal D?

[00:21:28:59]
P: That's affirmative, I haven't eaten that yet.

[00:21:29:01]
S: Okay, fine. That's all I have. Thank you.

[00:21:29:07]
P: Go ahead, Carnarvon, Gemini 4.

[00:21:29:08]
CC: Okay, do you have your gloves off?

[00:21:29:10]
P: That's affirmative. I've had my gloves off since
     ... I took my sleeves off after the first 4-hour
     sleep period that I had.

[00:21:29:18]
CC: Roger, understand. I've got your Apollo Landmark
     Run One. Ready to copy?

[00:21:29:23]
P: Stand by one, please.

[00:21:29:41]
P: Go ahead, ready to copy.

[00:21:29:43]
CC: Roger, Apollo Run One 13 54 08, northeast of track,
     92 miles, and ... constraint on attitude control.

[00:21:30:08]
CC: Roger, does the Command Pilot have his gloves off,
     also?

[00:21:30:16]
CC: Are the Command Pilot's gloves off?

[00:21:30:18]
P: Neg - he put them on to go back to sleep.

[00:21:30:21]
CC: Roger. Your Biomed no. 2 recorder should be on and
     your no. 1 OFF at this time.

[00:21:30:26]
P: Negative, we got a switch on that Pressure Regulator
     ... switch ... break switch has ... so that
     no. 1 ... and this is what the configuration is
     now, no. 1 is ON and no. 2 is OFF.

[00:21:30:38]
_page : 120
CC: Roger.

[00:21:30:40]
P: You might check that for us but that seems to be a
     rather late change and that's the configuration that
     we've been running in.

[00:21:30:46]
CC: All right. I'll check.

[00:21:31:09]
CC: We want your recorders in the position you are in
     right now.

[00:21:31:12]
P: Roger, understand. We're in the configuration with
     no. 1 ON and no. 2 OFF.

[00:21:31:15]
CC: That's affirmative. Very good.

CC: Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.

[00:22:10:00]
P: Go ahead Houston, Gemini 4.

[00:22:10:06]
CC: Roger, Ed. I got a little information to pass along
     to you here - are you reading okay?

[00:22:10:17]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.

[00:22:10:20]
P: Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4 is reading you five
     square.

[00:22:10:24]
CC: Roger, Ed. We want you to resume your normal Flight
     Plan. We base this on the fact that we feel that
     you have 205 ft/sec ΔV left and 63 revolutions you'll
     still be in a 81, 125.7 orbit. That will leave us
     enough for OAMS retro which we think will be
     113 ft/sec at that time - are you getting this?

[00:22:11:05]
P: Roger. Understand we expect at the 63 rev to be
     81, 125. We'll be required 113 OAMS approximately
     that time and we're prepared to go into our normal
     Flight Plan.

[00:22:11:17]
CC: Roger. Your orbit isn't decaying as fast as we had
     expected, has a decay factor of approximately 0.8.
     So we are very happy with your orbit and we don't
     feel you're going to need an orbit adjust.

[00:22:11:32]
P: That's right, it sounds good. That's this streamlined
     Gemini capsule.

[00:22:11:37]
_page : 121
CC: Also, this is based on the amount of fuel used up in
     your first orbit. We're using that as a basis.

[00:22:11:44]
P: Roger.

[00:22:11:46]
CC: Go ahead and try your Apollo Landmark Identification,
     but remember, the thing is 92 miles away so don't use
     very much fuel looking for it. I recommend that you
     reduce your use of fuel from now on.

[00:22:12:06]
CC: Okay.

[00:22:12:08]
P: You're starting to get broken up, Houston ...
     Houston do you read Gemini 4?

[00:22:12:15]
CC: Roger, read you.

[00:22:12:18]
CC: You're starting breakup; you seem to have a loud
     background noise.

[00:22:12:23]
CC: Roger, I'll get these for you when we pick up Bermuda,
     then.

[00:22:12:27]
P: Roger.

[00:22:13:13]
P: Go ahead, Houston, Gemini 4.

[00:22:13:16]
CC: Roger. What is the condition of your fan there?
     Are you on one fan or two fans?

[00:22:13:23]
P: We are on one fan, we have been on one fan for the
     last 2 hours.

[00:22:13:28]
CC: Roger, how's your comfort?

[00:22:13:30]
P: It's not bad. It gets a little warm in here. It
     seems to get warm when I go to sleep. I don't know
     why. It should get cold then, but seems to warm up
     then and we put them on for about 3 hours, two fans
     while I was asleep.

[00:22:13:43]
CC: Roger.

[00:22:13:45]
P: It seems to get a little warmer in this bunny suit.

[00:22:13:47]
CC: Yes, I'm not surprised.

[00:22:13:49]
P: Roger.

[00:22:13:52]
_page : 122
CC: Okay, the last thing I tried to get to you before I
     lost you a few seconds ago was the judicious use of
     fuel. They think you have enough to complete the
     whole Flight Plan now.

[00:22:14:05]
P: Understand. Why don't you give us a call on these
     landmark sightings?

[00:22:14:09]
CC: Roger, don't worry about that one in Africa because
     that is some 19 miles away and you are only 114 miles
     high at this time.

[00:22:14:19]
P: Roger, we will be looking for it. That's a real
     good one; we'll look for it but we won't use as much
     fuel. Looks like Jim's corked off pretty well. He
     hasn't stirred the last hour and a half.

[00:22:14:31]
CC: Okay, I had a news release for him here, about Mike's
     baseball team. You want to take it and pass it on to
     him?

[00:22:14:36]
P: Rog, pass it up.

[00:22:14:38]
CC: Okay, the Hawks won their Peewee League 3-2. They
     beat the Falcons. The Hawks got 3 runs on 2 hits,
     the Falcons got 2 runs on 3 hits.

[00:22:14:50]
P: Roger, understand, Hawks won 3-2.

[00:22:14:56]
CC: Roger. Hey, here's the headline of the Post today;
     you might pass along also, sounds pretty good. The
     big headlines are "Aw, Ed, Please Get Back In the
     Spaceship."

[00:22:15:10]
P: What was that? Say it again.

[00:22:15:14]
CC: The headlines are "Aw, Ed, Please Get Back In the
     Spaceship."

[00:22:15:18]
P: I'll give them to him when he gets up.

[00:22:15:21]
CC: Say again.

[00:22:15:23]
P: Come in, Gus, I'll tell you. It was a little tough
     to get in.

[00:22:15:29]
CC: I can't read you now, say again.

[00:22:15:31]
P: It was tough to come in and it was a little tough
     to get back in, too. But it sure was something out
     there!

[00:22:15:37]
CC: Yes, I bet! I envy you.

[00:22:15:41]
P: Roger, it was really great. Were ya'll reading us?
     We never knew when you were reading us or not.

[00:22:15:48]
_page : 123
CC: Yes, your VOX was keyed all the time and we couldn't
     get in or try to tell you that your time was up and
     to get back in. We could never get through to you
     at all.

[00:22:15:55]
P: Oh, is that right? I'm glad you didn't.

[00:22:15:58]
CC: I could tell that.

[00:22:16:02]
P: It was difficult to take pictures out there with
     that rig, ... was fine. We tried to get some
     pictures there ... but we never did get with my
     still camera pictures to my satisfaction.

[00:22:16:15]
CC: Say.

[00:22:16:19]
P: Reel on the outdoor 16-mm. We should be getting
     something with that.

[00:22:16:21]
CC: Yes, I hope you get some good ones. Could you give
     us Quantity Read for about 10 seconds?

[00:22:16:24]
P: Quantity is coming for 10 seconds.

[00:22:16:30]
CC: Have you had anything to eat yet?

[00:22:16:32]
P: I am in the middle of my first course of soup and
     I'm expected to get a little chicken salad and finish
     off with a fruit salad and orange juice.

[00:22:16:46]
CC: Okay, we got your quantity, so we we'll leave you
     alone and let you eat.

[00:22:16:50]
P: Say again.

[00:22:16:52]
CC: I said you can turn your Quantity Read OFF and we
     will leave you alone and let you eat.

[00:22:16:56]
P: Well, it was nice to talk to you and get all the
     news from the home front. As we went over Houston,
     I could actually see. When I was outside, I could
     see the Gulf and Galveston Bay and I could see right
     on up into Clear Lake.

[00:22:17:10]
CC: Could you see the Domed Stadium?

[00:22:17:13]
P: I was looking for it but I couldn't pick it out. I
     didn't see it. Say, if I could have spent time
     looking down I could have seen a lot. I can see a
     heck of a lot more from outside the spacecraft than
     inside. Things are very much clearer.

[00:22:17:27]
CC: Yes, I bet.

[00:22:17:30]
_page : 124
P: Really, one of the prettiest sights I saw was when
     I looked down and saw the southern tip of Florida
     and the island of Cuba and Puerto Rico and Santa
     Domingo. It was really quite a view. The colors
     of the blue and the blues as the water deepened out
     there, with the island was quite a view.

[00:22:17:59]
CC: Hey, Ed, when you came over on the night pass could
     you actually see the buildings?

[00:22:18:06]
P: On the night pass?

[00:22:18:08]
CC: Yes, you said at night view you could see ...

[00:22:18:10]
P: No, I couldn't. You might have misunderstood me.
     I couldn't see any buildings. And you might relay
     to the Australians that they're sure running up the
     electricity bill. I could see as we came over on
     this last pass. I could see the lights of Sydney
     loud and clear and the usual thunderstorms up north.

[00:22:18:30]
CC: Very good. Hey, Ed, you were talking about walking
     on the spacecraft. Were you actually walking on it?

[00:22:18:44]
P: Yes, I was. I was using the tether to pull myself
     down toward the spacecraft and I was right on top
     of it, as a matter of fact. The next time I get
     into this type of tether operation - it looks pretty
     good but it still is hard to get any traction on the
     top, but if you pull yourself down you can get a
     little bit.

[00:22:19:09]
CC: You forgot your magnets, I guess.

[00:22:19:12]
P: Yes. It looks like it will be pretty good on the
     adapter, too, so that might help a lot.

[00:22:19:20]
CC: Yes.

[00:22:58:08]
CC: We'll let you know when we're done here. We're
     reading you loud and clear and you look real good
     from here on the ground.

[00:22:58:15]
P: Roger, everything's going smooth up here. We delay
     a little bit when we answer you because we turned
     our UHF transmitter on at that time and we need a
     little time to warm up.

[00:22:58:25]
CC: Roger, ... the rest of the flight.

[00:22:58:27]
P: Roger, we are down at a minimum power-down configuration
     most of the time now, and whenever you call
     us, there's usually a little bit of a delay between
     our answer.

[00:22:58:37]
CC: Roger, understand. If you have anything else, we'll
     be down here waiting.

[00:22:58:42]
P: You might ask ... if they can work up some settings
     for inside-the-spacecraft pictures; we have 200 feet
     of film. I have taken a few in here already, but I
     thought they might give us a suggested light meter
     reading.

[00:22:59:01]
_page : 126
CC: Roger. We'll see if we can get it for you.

[00:22:59:02]
P: Also get a movie camera 16-mm setting for inside
     the spacecraft. We have a large bug eye, and we
     thought that we'd take some pictures with in inside
     if we had a little film left over.

[00:22:59:17]
CC: Roger.

[00:22:59:37]
P: Carnarvon, Gemini 4.

[00:22:59:40]
CC: Gemini 4, go ahead.

[00:22:59:41]
P: Roger, you might relay that we saw the lights of
     Sydney. I don't know whether they turned them on
     or not, but if they did they sure ran up the electrical
     bill. I saw them on the last orbit. We
     went right over the town of Sydney and they were
     really loud and clear.

[00:22:59:56]
CC: Okay, the people appreciate that.

[00:22:59:58]
P: ... big electrical bill ...

[00:23:46:03]
P: Roger. Understand 161° West and 16 14 30.

[00:23:46:09]
CC: Roger, and we'd like to know what was the status of
     the experiments MSC-1, -2, and -3. Recall?

[00:23:46:18]
P: Roger, we have been doing them as per Flight Plan.
     We left MSC-2 and -3 on after our thrusting a little
     longer than planned. We turned it off at about 4:20,
     if I recall right. We were planning to turn it off
     around 3:00.

[00:23:46:58]
CC: What's the housekeeping like in there? Have you
     got junk all over?

[00:23:47:01]
P: No, it's not too bad. We've got the bulk of all
     the extra stuff stored underneath our legs behind
     our heels, it's stuff you don't use very much anyhow
     so it's not much of a discomfort. But we've
     got the cameras and bags and refuse bags pretty
     well stuck all around on the Velcro.

[00:23:47:20]
CC: Okay. Have you tried getting any of that stuff
     back into the AFT food boxes?

[00:23:47:25]
P: No, the refuse will be - we're planning to have a
     big dump back there into the right food box.

[00:23:47:33]

     your blood pressure. Do not acknowledge.

     airglow combined with some Northern lights type effect
     occurring in 15, 16, and 17.

P: The whole airglow layer looks like a way out on the horizon.

[01:02:08:58]
CC: Gemini, Carnarvon. We have a valid temp on
     the probe. How do you read? Over.

CC: Gemini 4, Carnarvon. How do you read?

CC: Roger, looks good on the ground. What's your status
     up there?

[01:02:09:29]
P: Our status is GO.

[01:02:09:30]
CC: Okay. Stand by for Surgeon.

[01:02:09:35]
S: Gemini 4, this is the Surgeon. Can you give me some
     information on your food and water consumption?

[01:02:09:37]
C: Roger. This is Command Pilot. I woke up about
     30 minutes ago. Then I had lunch.

[01:02:09:46]
S: Gemini 4, Gemini 4, this is the Surgeon. Do you
     read? Over.

[01:02:09:52]
CC: Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM. Give me a readout on
     your food and water consumption ...

[01:02:09:56]
C: Roger, this is Gemini 4. How do you read?

[01:02:09:58]
CC: Loud and clear. How me?

[01:02:10:00]
C: Loud and clear. I woke up about 30 or 40 minutes
     ago and then - actually I didn't wake up right
     then - just sort of sitting there resting. I really
     haven't been having much luck sleeping. I had a
     drink of water when I first woke up, about 5 gulps.
     Then I had another one there about halfway through
     my sleeping period, about 5 gulps. I plan on eating
     something as soon as I get through with my HF tests.

[01:02:10:24]
CC: Roger, understand.

[01:02:10:28]
C: So far I've been through three meals. I'm going to
     eat meal 4 on the first day.

[01:02:10:34]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[01:02:10:36]
_page : 139
C: Doctor, be advised, I'm having a lot of trouble with
     this blood pressure cuff. I can't get it to stay
     in my suit and when I do get it in it doesn't want
     to bleed down. So if you see some erratic pump-ups,
     it's because I'm not having much luck with it.

[01:02:10:50]
CC: Okay.

[01:02:11:00]
S: Gemini 4, this is the Surgeon.

[01:02:11:03]
C: Go ahead, Surgeon.

[01:02:11:05]
S: Could you repeat again what you ate out of meal 3
     or meal C? Meal Charlie.

[01:02:11:11]
C: Roger. I ate everything out of it except the orange
     juice and I lost that some place. I don't know
     where it went.

[01:02:11:16]
S: Okay. Is that all you have had to eat since you ate
     meal Baker?

[01:02:11:20]
C: Roger. Oh yes, that's right, I didn't eat the toast
     either. That toast is the crumbly toast that we
     agreed not to eat.

[01:02:11:28]
S: Okay. So you ate the other items. Thank you.

[01:02:11:32]
S: Can you explain a little about this blood pressure
     problem? Are you sure you didn't have your thumb
     over the holes where the air comes out?

[01:02:11:38]
C: I have had the same problem ever since lift-off. I
     can't get the darn thing to stay in my suit. It
     keeps popping out of my suit, and then I have quite
     a difficult time getting it to bleed down sometimes.

[01:02:11:49]
S: We got a valid blood pressure but the temperature
     seems - the pressure seemed to hold up for quite a
     while before it began to bleed off.

[01:02:11:55]
C: That's right. Most of the time it seems to bleed
     out around where I plug it in rather than through
     the hole it's supposed to bleed from.

[01:02:12:02]
S: Okay, this is the Surgeon out.

[01:02:12:04]
C: Roger.

     they did not get a valid time in at the Cape. You

     the stations are reading us?

[01:02:37:16]
CC: Roger. We monitored you real weak on HF just now.

[01:02:37:24]
P: Roger. I understand. You didn't read us when we
     made our test then obviously because you gave us no
     response.

[01:02:37:31]
CC: Roger. We were copying till you gave your test.
     We did not copy then.

     That area is cloudy and to help you on your Flight
     Plan there - Run 2 was to be at 28:30 elapsed time
     and Run 3 was to be at 30:05 elapsed time. Okay.
     The D-9 Experiment? Do it in drifting flight if
     you do it. We don't feel that you should waste any

     Well, the Astros beat Cincinatti 8 to 3. Rusty Staub
     hit a homer. And in your boys' team, the Hawks beat
     the Falcons 3 to 2. Mike walked twice, was left on
     base once, and was forced out - forced to second the
     other time.

[01:02:44:27]
C: Roger. He had a good night.

[01:02:44:29]

     at Walker Air Force Base last night when a KC-135
     crashed on landing. Most of the rest of the news is

C: Roger. Say it again. I didn't read anything.

[01:03:40:59]
CC: Roger. How do you read me now?

[01:03:41:00]
C: Sounds better.

[01:03:41:02]
CC: Okay. You look good here on the ground. Are you
     ready to copy a block of updates?

C: Carnarvon, Gemini 4. We're ready to copy.

[01:03:41:53]
CC: Okay. This will be a little bit different. When I
     read you ΔV, the first two numbers will be forward.
     The second two numbers will be aft. The same thing
     with ΔT. The first group will be forward, and the
     second group will be aft. Do you understand that?

P: I believe I got them all.

[01:03:47:13]
CC: Okay, very good.

[01:03:47:16]
P: There was one thing - that one you gave me, that was
     for 20 - it was the seventh one. Is that 20-1?

[01:03:47:29]
CC: Was that 22-Delta 113 ft/sec?

[01:03:47:33]
P: No. It was the seventh one you gave me, and it was
     for Area 20, and what was the area on it?

[01:04:21:31]
S: We have received the good blood pressure. We're
     standing by for your food report. Have you eaten
     since your Carnarvon Aero-Med Pass?

[01:04:21:38]
C: Negative, this is the Command Pilot. I just got
     the chow out, and I'm just about to set to it.

[01:04:21:44]
S: Say again, Gemini.

[01:04:21:45]
C: Negative, I have not eaten since my Carnarvon Aero-Med
     Pass, but I have the food out, and I'm just
     about to start.

[01:04:21:52]
S: Roger, understand. Have you had any water?

[01:04:21:55]
C: One very small drink, but I plan to have some water
     with my food later.

[01:04:22:01]
S: Is the Pilot asleep?

[01:04:22:07]
S: Gemini, Guaymas SIR JOHN.

[01:04:22:10]
C: Roger, Guaymas. This is Gemini 4 here. The Pilot
     is still awake. He's getting something to eat now
     too. As soon as he finishes, he's going to sleep.

CC: Gemini 4, how do you read Houston CAP COM now?

[01:04:30:32]
C: ... make it work.

[01:04:35:50]
P: It seems like on the last roll, that the red light
     didn't come on at the end of the roll. We were
     running at the end of the roll when I noticed it,
     so we might have lost the tape dump between the
     last tape, 8, and the present tape, 6.

[01:04:38:36]
P: The O<sub>2</sub> pressure gage is unsatisfactory in many respects.
     Not only does it not have enough scale,
     but, in our case now the ... is set down low
     enough so that it is setting in the normal operating
     range. We're causing it to go to O<sub>2</sub> High Rate all
     the time to bring it down.

[01:04:38:55]
C: Actually it's not the gage itself. It's the fact
     that the vent pressure is set lower ...

[01:04:39:00]
P: That's right ... bottles.

[01:04:39:04]
P: ... vent ground -

[01:04:39:05]
C: It vents low in our cabin also. The cabin holds
     about 4.8 or 9 - normal.

[01:04:39:33]
C: And the cabin vents at about 5.3.

[01:04:39:48]
P: I can see them working on McDonnell now on this
     gain. I imagine there's fur flying. It's going to
     be when we get back. I'm going to hit them hard on
     it. I want to know just when they cleaned that.
     Remember? They were instructed to do it the day
     before the flight.

[01:04:40:12]
C: The trouble is, it wasn't only that, but just getting
     your whole hatch closed, it never ever took that
     kind of pulling on it before. That rubber must have
     gotten real hard or something.

[01:04:40:19]
P: Oh! You know one thing - see, I was giving you no
     help here at all.

[01:04:40:26]
C: You never needed to give me any help - before.

[01:04:40:28]
P: All I was doing was working this, and with the
     handle - I was fooling with the handle.

[01:04:40:31]
C: Yes, but you have never given any help before though,
     really.

[01:04:40:33]
_page : 151
P: In fact, you were saying, "Don't break the handle
     off!" Remember that?

[01:04:40:37]
C: Was I?

[01:04:40:38]
P: Yes.

[01:04:40:40]
C: On this one?

[01:04:40:43]
P: No, this one. You were telling me not to break that
     handle off?

[01:04:40:48]
C: I don't remember that, but sounds like good advice.

[01:04:40:50]
P: I was sitting in there. Heave! Heave! Ha! Ha! Ha!
     You remember that?

[01:04:40:57]
C: I remember the "heave" part. Too bad that wasn't
     all on tape.

[01:04:41:02]
P: If it is, it'd be tremendous, wouldn't it?

[01:04:41:03]
C: Yes.

[01:04:41:04]
P: That's what it took? it took both of us together
     to get it down.

[01:04:41:12]
P: Well, I was down low enough, so that the hatch had
     come all the way down and stopped.

[01:04:41:16]
C: I thought it actually stopped on your ...

[01:04:41:21]
P: On the head?

[01:04:41:24]
C: On your helmet.

[01:04:41:26]
P: I don't think ...

[01:04:41:28]
C: I pulled and you'd go down lower. Every time I'd
     pull, you would come down lower.

[01:04:41:31]
P: I was doing this; every time I came down lower, my
     legs went "boink."

[01:04:41:33]
C: Oh, yes.

[01:04:41:35]
P: There at the end, though, they were all right.

[01:04:41:43]
C: Not like in that zero-g airplane, is it? ...
     "Aw hell. Well, pull the hatch."

[01:04:41:48]
P: Yes.

[01:04:41:50]
P: Well, we'll try another parabola.

[01:04:41:57]
P: I think Tom better take a close look at it, too -
     with that chest pack.

[01:04:42:02]
C: He's a lot bigger than you are.

[01:04:42:04]
_page : 152
P: He's a lot less agile.

[01:04:42:07]
C: I wonder if we ought to ...

[01:04:42:14]
P: Yes, I know. You know how it is with that - that
     chest pack in there is tough in the zero-g airplane.

[01:04:42:24]
C: Yes. Well, you tend to always overrate our own
     abilities, too.

[01:04:42:28]
P: Yes.

[01:04:42:38]
P: Now I can see the stars.

[01:04:42:48]
P: No, but it's broad daylight over there, isn't it?
     Are we starting to go in?

[01:04:42:52]
C: Broad daylight over here.

[01:04:43:00]
C: We better vent one more time. That ought to get ...

[01:04:43:07]
P: I hate to see us using up our oxygen that way.

[01:04:43:09]
C: Yes. Well, we're going to use it up anyway. We
     don't ...

[01:04:43:16]
P: Want me to get it?

[01:04:43:52]
P: I'm going to start eating.

[01:04:44:07]
C: I don't know what happened. I got a head start,
     and you get the first meal.

[01:04:44:14]
P: It's the same meal.

[01:04:44:16]
C: The first one ...

[01:04:44:26]
P: Actually, we are behind.

[01:04:44:28]
C: Yes, we are ... 4 hours ...

[01:04:44:38]
P: ... try to eat.

[01:04:44:43]
C: If you eat more, Ed, you wouldn't be able to do
     anything else. Isn't that the truth?

[01:04:44:52]
P: We are not permitted to do a whole heck of a lot.
     Actually though, our Flight Plan is fairly leisurely.
     We're not really ...

[01:04:45:07]
C: ... S-5 ... Hello, Houston. This is Gemini 4.

[01:04:45:18]
C: You're broken up a little bit, but I can read you.
     Be advised we vented our ECS pressure down to about
     910, 920.

[01:04:45:40]
P: ...

[01:04:45:52]
C: We really ought to be keeping better track where we
     are and where our retrofire points are.

[01:04:46:03]
_page : 153
P: Yes.

[01:04:46:09]
P: I don't know, there is not anything very difficult
     about it, though. There are just the times.

[01:04:46:48]
C: Did I hear somebody call Gemini 4?

[01:04:47:07]
P: Where is the Contarex? See it lately?

[01:04:47:14]
C: It used to be over here. I don't know where it is
     now.

[01:04:47:19]
P: I see it.

[01:04:47:24]
P: You want it?

[01:04:47:26]
C: Yes.

[01:04:47:31]
P: Let me put this over here for a minute, Jim.

[01:04:47:33]
C: Yes, why don't we just put it there?

[01:04:47:36]
P: I've got to lean forward a minute to get to this
     umbilical.

[01:04:47:48]
P: Here's your Contarex.

[01:04:47:52]
P: Oh. The settings for the Contarex in the cabin -
     I wrote down and I'll get them and show you where
     they are.

[01:04:48:53]
P: Okay. The 16-mm is f/11, if it's right in front of
     you, and f/28 if it's otherwise. The 35 is - with
     the ASA 200, which we have two rolls of - is 1/250
     f/11 and ...

[01:04:50:24]
C: Okay. Which Biomed recorder is on now?

[01:04:50:26]
P: Right now mine is on.

[01:04:50:28]
C: And yours is off.

[01:04:50:30]
P: Mine is on. I turned yours off as you got up.

[01:04:50:36]
C: You're wearing yours out. You're using yours too
     much ...

[01:04:50:38]
P: All right.

[01:04:50:43]
C: As soon as you wake up turn it off for quite a
     while.

[01:04:50:50]
P: Doggone it ...

[01:04:50:52]
C: Couldn't hear you.

[01:04:51:31]

     whole ...

P: You notice that (illegible)

[01:04:51:48]
P: You know this is a lot of trouble, but still you
     end up getting a lot of moisture and stuff with it,
     too.

[01:04:51:55]
C: ...

[01:04:52:07]
P: I highly recommend it on the long flight.

[01:04:52:12]
C: Something to do.

[01:04:52:14]
P: Yes, and I don't know what in the world, - where
     they can fit all this stuff.

[01:04:52:42]
C: What do you want to do? Just ... on your and
     ... drink?

[01:04:52:45]
P: Yes ...

[01:04:53:21]
P: This isn't recommended with ... gloves on, at all.

[01:04:53:28]
C: Are you going to sleep a little while, or are you
     going to ... ?

[01:04:53:31]
P: Yes, I think I will sleep. Go ahead and move around
     a little bit if you want to.

[01:04:53:40]
P: I tell you, I like it better in here with the visor
     open.

[01:04:53:48]
C: You know what?

[01:04:53:50]
P: What?

[01:04:53:51]
C: I think that I'll take a little more of that ...

[01:04:53:52]
P: Eye stuff?

[01:04:54:00]
C: Yes, with my helmet visor closed ...

[01:04:54:02]
P: ...

[01:04:54:45]
P: You know, maybe that's why we sleep decently for
     a while and then - CRUSH!

[01:04:54:55]
P: Let's see what I can rig up with my faceplate open.

[01:04:55:04]
C: ... water.

[01:04:55:11]
P: I wonder. Our relative humidity is fine, Jim.

[01:04:55:19]
P: We've been ... around with our faceplates open
     a lot.

[01:04:55:31]
P: Actually, this relative humidity gage is kind of
     nice. It allows you to keep a tab on what's going
     on.

[01:04:55:59]
_page : 155
P: Yes. This padded stuff might have bought us a
     little protection on the water problem and another
     problem with it though.

[01:04:56:08]
C: What's that?

[01:04:56:10]
P: The ammonia stuff.

[01:04:56:25]
C: ... anything ... ammonia ...

[01:04:56:33]
P: That's the way it was explained, anyhow.

[01:04:56:45]
C: Do you want to try closing the faceplates and ... ?

[01:04:56:52]
P: You know, it doesn't bother me. I feel lousy every
     time I wake up. It takes you a while to get feeling
     good again.

[01:04:57:11]
P: Here's the data book.

[01:04:58:43]
C: ... bag, but I don't know what I'm going to do
     with it.

[01:04:58:49]
P: Which one? Oh, those ...

[01:04:58:50]
C: Aw shoot!

[01:04:59:04]
C: I wonder if we should dismantle the ... what did
     you do with it?

[01:04:59:06]
P: It's up in a bag behind my shoulder.

[01:04:59:14]
C: Where, the lens?

[01:04:59:16]
P: You don't have to dismantle it, Jim. The lens is
     right here.

[01:04:59:19]
C: I know. I said, "Where is it?"

[01:04:59:21]
P: The lens is right here.

[01:04:59:23]
C: There's no need to really dismantle the other one
     if it works.

[01:04:59:26]
P: No, that will fit that lens.

[01:04:59:28]
C: No, I wasn't worried about the lens. I was worried
     about the camera.

[01:04:59:31]
P: Oh.

[01:04:59:38]
P: We've got a lot of movie film we might as well take.

[01:04:59:40]
C: We've got a lot of other kinds of film we better
     take ...

[01:04:59:50]

     good here on the ground. How are you up there?

[01:05:15:15]
C: Everything is fine.

[01:05:15:19]
CC: Pilot still asleep?

[01:05:15:22]
C: Went to sleep about 15 or 20 minutes ago.

[01:05:15:35]
CC: Oh, let me figure it out here. Hold a second.

[01:05:15:50]
CC: About 20 minutes ago.

[01:05:15:54]
C: I can't tell you.

[01:05:15:56]
CC: Okay. Did you hear Cape CAP COM talking - Houston
     CAP COM to you on air-ground transfer over Ascension?

[01:05:16:03]
C: Roger. I did. He came in for about two or three
     transmissions, and then that was all I got.

[01:05:16:09]
CC: Roger, was he pretty garbled?

[01:05:16:11]
C: Yes, he was. And as a matter of fact, now that you
     mention it, I wasn't parallel to the ground. I was,
     I think, maybe pointing just about straight up.

[01:05:16:20]
CC: Roger. Your nose was straight up.

[01:05:16:22]
C: Just about like that. However, right now I'm pointing
     about straight down so we're in pretty good
     shape.

[01:05:16:27]
CC: Roger. I'm receiving you now, better than we have
     on almost any pass.

[01:05:16:32]
_page : 157
C: Okay. Stand by. I think we're also on the adapter
     antenna here.

[01:05:16:36]
CC: Roger.

[01:05:16:38]
C: Yes, we went to adapter when we started playing with
     the HF check, and we just left it there. And it
     seems to be working just as well as the reentry
     does.

[01:05:16:48]
CC: Roger. Seems a little bit better here.

[01:05:16:51]
C: Yes, we sure had a lot of radio trouble to start
     with, but it seems to have all smoothed out.

[01:05:16:56]
CC: That's the way we want to go.

[01:05:16:59]
C: Hope things get better, and not worse, huh?

[01:05:17:01]
CC: Say again.

[01:05:17:03]
C: As long as things get better, instead of worse.

[01:05:17:11]
CC: Let's give that stub antenna a try. If you don't
     read me in about 10 seconds, come back to this
     frequency on this antenna.

[01:05:17:25]
C: Gemini 4 here, how do you read me on my nose?

[01:05:17:28]
CC: Okay, I read you just slightly garbled. How me?
     Over.

[01:05:17:31]
C: Loud and clear.

[01:05:17:33]
CC: Okay. Let's go back to the antenna again.

[01:05:17:35]
CC: The adapter.

[01:05:17:37]
C: Roger. On the adapter. How do you read me now?

[01:05:17:39]
CC: It's just about the same.

[01:05:17:45]
C: How do you read Gemini 4 now?

[01:05:17:52]
CC: Okay. We'd like you to go back to the nose stub
     antenna.

[01:05:17:59]
C: Carnarvon, Gemini 4. You're all broken up now.

[01:05:18:02]
CC: Roger. Will you switch back to your nose stub
     antenna.

[01:05:18:12]
CC: How do you read me?

[01:05:18:14]
C: I read you loud and clear. I'm back on the nose
     antenna.

[01:05:18:19]
CC: Okay. Will you remain on that antenna, please?

C: Okee-doke.

[01:05:18:20]

     there?

[01:05:52:17]
C: Fine. I just saw something else up here with me,
     but just as I was getting close enough to it to take
     a good picture, the sun got in the way and I lost it.

[01:05:52:26]
CC: Roger. We got some flight plan changes for you.
     Want to stand by to copy?

C: Roger. Understand they want us to take areas of
     terrain wherever it is visible, and not to wait
     until the last day. Be advised we would like to
     save some film, though, until we get the opportunity
     to make a pass across the Southwestern United States

P: We're on RECORD now.

[01:08:05:01]
C: ... the stars.

[01:08:05:13]
P: I'm coming down on the horizon now, and you can
     certainly see the definite two layers to the air
     glow, the one that is quite thick at the top, and
     you can see the stars as they drop through it.

[01:08:05:27]
C: You mean the one that's dim?

[01:08:05:29]
_page : 165
P: Yes. Yes, and as the stars drop through it, they
     occult a little bit; then they pop out on the left-hand
     part and you can actually see them go out all
     the way out as they hit the true horizon down at
     the bottom. It looks like to me - what would you
     estimate if you took the included angle. I would
     include that angle at about 7 or 8° say, from here.

[01:08:05:49]
C: ...

[01:08:05:51]
P: I estimated it higher before.

[01:08:05:56]
C: The dense layer at the top is about a third ...

[01:08:05:58]
P: Yes, I'd estimated it about a third or sixth.

[01:08:06:05]
P: I used the green filter on the sextant, and the
     green filter does make a clearer and more defined
     horizon than no filter at all. Would you like to
     take a look at the sextant?

[01:08:06:20]
C: Yes ... horizon.

[01:08:06:27]
P: You've got a good one now, don't you?

[01:08:06:32]
P: I'm unwinding it out ... the umbilical right now.
     Here it comes.

[01:08:06:34]
P: Okay. There it comes.

[01:08:06:39]
P: Sure is easy to move things around, isn't it? That
     8-pound sextant, you just handle it like it weighs
     an ounce.

[01:08:06:46]
C: ...

[01:08:06:49]
P: Try the green filter. See if you don't feel it makes
     a more defined horizon.

[01:08:07:15]
P: Now we've got what I would consider darn near perfect
     star-seeing conditions with the moon effect as
     small as it is. As we were saying before, the magnitude
     of the stars - it looks like we can go right
     down to seventh order or maybe just a hair below,
     using our calibration, the Corona Australis. I
     have a little flash right out in front of me out
     there.

[01:08:07:41]
P: Yes.

[01:08:07:53]
C: ...

[01:08:07:56]
P: You saw all kinds of what?

[01:08:08:01]
P: Yes. Oh.

_page : 166
P: Jim, I'm going to take a check on the tape recorder.
     I don't trust it since the bulb didn't work on it
     the last time. Will the lights bother you?

[01:08:09:20]
P: It looks like the tape's still running through and
     I haven't gotten the red light yet. That is sure
     unsatisfactory - the location of the tape recorder
     light. The whole tape recorder - that's right, the
     whole tape recorder operation is wrong. It ought
     to be something you can have on in continuous so
     that you can talk over the radios, also. Particularly
     on launch - you end up not getting any of that
     on tape.

[01:08:10:01]
C: Okay. I just started my ...

[01:08:10:15]

     through it.

[01:08:11:37]
C: Okay.

[01:08:11:44]
P: See how long it takes.

[01:08:12:03]
P: Right now it's entering the dim part.

[01:08:12:17]
P: And, out it comes.

[01:08:12:25]
P: It took 49 1/2 seconds to come up through. Let's
     see if I can duplicate that. Get another measurement.

[01:08:12:44]
C: ...

[01:08:12:46]
P: A degree and a half. Boy, that sure is deceiving.

[01:08:14:08]
P: Okay. Now I've got a good star. I started it
     early. You know: down below the air glow it kind
     of peters out to just about nothing, where the stars
     start coming out, and then they start moving into
     the air glow. I see a star very clearly and now
     it's starting to come into the air glow.

[01:08:14:32]
P: On that first measurement I made I really didn't -
     I think the air glow starts down below - a little
     bit below, where, looking at it from here, it looks
     like it really starts.

[01:08:15:10]
_page : 167
P: Oh! Did you see that flash? Huh? Yes. A very
     bright flash right on the air glow. It was on your
     side. A very bright flash and went out.

[01:08:15:25]
C: No, I didn't see it. Is the recorder on now?

[01:08:15:29]
P: Yes.

[01:08:15:34]
C: 2°, 25 minutes.

[01:08:15:41]
P: How many, Jim?

[01:08:15:44]
C: 2°, 25 minutes.

[01:08:15:45]
P: Okay.

[01:08:15:49]
P: Shucks! Now keep a bright eye out your window,
     because the area I saw is in your window now -
     where I saw the flash. It was right at the top
     of the air glow.

[01:08:16:05]
P: Boy, are the stars good now!

[01:08:16:20]
C: It sure looks funny right down below us ...

[01:08:16:23]
P: Yes.

[01:08:16:25]
C: The lights of the city and then on the horizon out
     there are the blinking lights ... upside down
     ... side-up.

[01:08:16:34]
P: There! See it again? Out your side?

[01:08:16:41]
C: You're not kidding. That was on the earth.

[01:08:16:44]
P: It was shooting down toward the - that one was much
     lower.

[01:08:16:46]
C: Oh, it's shooting down into the earth.

[01:08:16:49]
P: Yes.

[01:08:16:50]
P: Wonder what that was?

[01:08:16:52]
C: Maybe it was a falling star.

[01:08:16:53]
P: I don't know.

[01:08:16:58]
C: ... wearing that big bulky suit to protect you
     from those falling stars.

[01:08:17:01]
P: Yes, I checked my suit very closely, and I saw no
     meteorite holes, much to my delight.

[01:08:17:15]
P: Okay. I tracked a bright star, and I believe that's
     out there in Aquila. In fact, I'm quite sure. I
     can see the two target stars. I've tracked it all
     the way up. It's almost to the top. It's going to
     go out of my view right now. I had him all the
     way from the bottom, and it took 3 minutes 23 seconds
     to come all the way up. That was tracking a
     big star like Altair.

[01:08:17:46]
_page : 168
C: ...

[01:08:17:51]
P: No. No. Come right up from the bottom of the horizon,
     up through the air glow layer. From the first
     time, I saw it till it reached what I consider the
     top of the air glow layer, it took 3 minutes and
     23 seconds.

[01:08:18:03]
C: Long time, isn't it?

[01:08:18:05]
P: Much longer than I thought, and it started way down
     ... That's why I was looking for a bright one
     like that.

[01:08:18:25]
P: Yes. Look out and see if you don't see Altair out
     your side. See Aquila, the two ... stars?

[01:08:18:37]
P: Drifted down to the bottom of your window, if you
     see it at all.

[01:08:18:46]
P: It may never come up to your view.

[01:08:18:58]
P: Corona Australis came up.

[01:08:19:05]
P: What? I know. I tried to make a measurement that
     way. Sure doesn't work very well, does it?

[01:08:19:22]
C: Yes, it just doesn't work when the world is upside
     down.

[01:08:20:20]
C: I think we are about to have a sunrise.

[01:08:20:29]
P: ...

[01:08:20:46]

[01:08:20:55]
P: Okay.

[01:08:21:17]
C: ...

[01:08:21:22]
P: Yes ... burning up ... and what I saw went
     right into the air glow. There goes another one!
     See it?

[01:08:21:47]
P: ... is deceptive as far as the altitude ...

[01:08:21:58]
P: ... the fireflies ...

[01:08:22:29]
P: I think the ... the red light ... ought to
     change it.

P: What?

[01:08:23:14]
_page : 169
C: ...

[01:08:23:15]
P: No. I was going to catch it as it came out so I
     could catch the strange effect of one side in sunlight
     and the other side in night. I'm going to
     start turning it on now at 19 and see what I get.
     Should be pretty dark ...

     came on that pack. We'd better check to see if
     no. 8 has some way of turning the light on. It
     might be the film tape magazine that causes the

CC: Gemini 4, CSQ. Houston would like to know what
     your relative bearing was when you sighted the

[01:08:40:51]
P: Roger. Stand by one, please. Do you have a relative
     bearing for them?

[01:08:41:00]
P: Yes, I'm pulling it, but I'm not getting anything.
     Just the same way as it was when you were doing it
     for me.

P: Is this valve screwed up here in any way?

[01:08:41:14]
_page : 170
P: Yes, I'm pulling.

[01:08:41:24]
C: Roger, CSQ ... and the satellite was up near
     the sun. My small end started drifting up on us,
     drifting slightly. And I saw the thing over the
     small end which I think was pointed toward the east.

[01:08:41:38]
C: ... I saw it over the small end, which I think
     was pointed toward the east.

[01:08:41:52]
CC: Gemini 4, CSQ. You were not up on the first part
     of your transmission. I got, "Saw it over small
     end and you believe were pointed east." What was
     the first part of your transmission?

[01:08:42:02]
C: Roger. My small end was up above the horizon so I
     couldn't see the horizon. As it came around toward
     the sun I saw the - this other satellite, but then
     as the sun came in through the window I lost it because
     the sun was so bright.

[01:08:42:17]
CC: Roger. You were looking into the sun then, when
     you saw it?

[01:08:42:20]
C: That's affirmative.

[01:08:42:22]
C: Okay. Pull harder.

[01:08:42:27]
CC: Okay. I got your 33-1 load up. I've got your 33-1
     backup guidance quantities when you're prepared to
     copy. We had a little problem last pass. We had
     a complete power failure about two-thirds the way
     through the pass.

[01:08:42:32]
C: Give it a big tug?

[01:08:42:34]
P: I'm pulling, Jim. I'm pulling, Jim.

CC: Gemini 4, CSQ. You are fading away.

[01:08:46:20]
P: I'm taking some general - normal lens on the 16-mm
     photographs of the water and the clouds at the present
     time. We've been having a lot of trouble with
     the ON/OFF button on this camera. It goes only
     about every third or fourth actuation. This might
     explain some of the reason why Jim didn't get as
     much film on that first - in our EVA work.

[01:08:48:08]
P: For analyzing these films - we're taking them at
     00:04. We're taking them of the ocean and the cloud
     background. They look like they have fair the weather
     cumulus with the characteristic cirrus above. I'm
     taking quite a lot of them on the flight.

[01:08:56:41]

     through the Pacific cloud area. We're taking the
     first picture now.

     Using the same old setting - 250 at 11 ...

_page : 172
P: I'm also taking some pictures with the 16-mm camera
     of the same area, with the normal lens.

[01:09:01:17]
P: Feels like the shutter is sticking on at the
     Hasselblad at the present time on some of these
     pictures. This is the second series of the S-6
     pictures over the Atlantic. The film-advance
     mechanism is definitely causing erratic operation
     of the Hasselblad. I'll be operating it manually
     from here on.

[01:09:04:12]
P: This next one I'll be shooting into the sun, and I

     a critical dump over the CSQ. Request that you be
     in attitude for that.

[01:10:47:54]
P: Roger. Have you been not receiving some of our
     dumps?

[01:10:48:01]
CC: Negative. All of your dumps have been very good.

[01:10:48:04]
P: Roger. Rather than power-up and go to heads-up
     attitude, we'd just as soon continue in the manner
     in which we have. I went to the powered-up configuration
     and heads-up over Hawaii for that dump. I
     would prefer to remain in a free-drift mode at this
     time.

[01:10:48:23]
CC: Roger. Flight says that's okay.

[01:10:48:26]
P: Roger. Thank you.

[01:10:48:27]
CC: Okay. We'd also like to get a Primary O<sub>2</sub> read.
     Would you cycle it ON, please?

[01:10:48:32]
P: Roger. Coming ON.

[01:10:48:46]
CC: When was the last time that you had Primary O<sub>2</sub> read?

[01:10:48:52]
P: It was probably while I was asleep.

[01:10:48:54]

CC: Roger.

[01:10:48:58]
CC: There's no need to get it too accurately.

[01:10:49:02]
P: Roger. I have turned it OFF. Do you want me to
     put it back ON?

[01:10:49:07]
CC: How long did you have it cycled ON?

[01:10:49:10]
P: Roger ... had it ON for 10 seconds.

[01:10:49:12]
CC: Roger. I think we have it.

[01:10:49:14]
P: Roger.

[01:10:49:17]
CC: What are you reading onboard?

[01:10:49:24]
P: Stand by one.

[01:10:49:25]
CC: Roger.

[01:10:49:36]
P: My onboard reading is 34 percent, and I'm holding
     right at 940 psi.

[01:10:49:45]
CC: Roger. That concurs with our readings on the ground.

[01:10:49:48]
P: Roger.

[01:10:49:55]
CC: Roger. All systems look good here from the ground.

[01:10:49:57]
P: ..., we're pulling in the neighborhood of about 13 to 14 amps.

[01:10:50:06]
CC: Roger. I understand in the neighborhood of 13 to
     14 amps.

[01:10:50:10]
P: Roger. We've turned everything off that ...
     there's just one small light on.

[01:10:50:40]
CC: Flight advises that they need the tape dump over
     the CSQ, so please go into proper attitude. That
     will be at a G.m.t. of 03 hours 03 minutes. Do
     you copy?

[01:10:50:51]
P: Roger. 03:03, and we'll be in a tape dump attitude.

[01:10:50:57]
CC: Roger. We're coming up on LOS.

[01:10:50:59]
P: Roger.

[01:11:12:26]
P: Hey, Jim, babe. Are you sleeping?

[01:11:12:33]
C: What?

[01:11:12:35]
P: Did you go to sleep?

[01:11:12:37]
C: ...

[01:11:12:40]
_page : 178
P: I didn't think you were. I let you overshoot
     15 minutes worth. I was doing D-8, and there wasn't
     any reason for you to wake up.

[01:11:12:57]
P: Do you think we're sleeping too much? All we do is
     sleep.

[01:11:13:14]
P: I think it's an eat period for myself, but I think
     we should both eat ... here.

[01:11:13:26]
P: In fact, I got so hungry while you were asleep that
     I didn't ... food on either snack.

[01:11:13:31]
C: Yes, as a matter of fact ...

[01:11:13:33]
P: The matter of another meal.

[01:11:13:39]
P: We got congratulations over Hawaii! Did you hear
     it?

[01:11:13:40]
P: We passed the United States space record. And we
     have got a very important tape dump at 03:03. I
     think it was over CSQ, and they wanted ... up for
     it. I asked them - I said, "Are you getting all of
     our timed taped dump?" They said, "Perfectly." I
     said, "Why can't we just remain in drifting flight,
     powered down?" They said, "Stand by."

[01:11:14:09]
P: They came back and said that's what they wanted, so
     I said, "okay."

[01:11:14:11]
P: MSC-1 is OFF now. MSC-2 and -3 - I just turned
     those OFF. I'm going to switch Biomedical recorders.
     I think after this, we'll go ahead and let them run.

[01:11:14:24]
C: Listen, let's leave yours ...

[01:11:14:31]
P: Okay.

[01:11:14:33]
C: You've been running yours like mad, and I haven't
     been running mine at all.

[01:11:14:35]
P: Okay. Here we go. Switched back.

[01:11:14:38]
C: ... 100 hours on yours ...

[01:11:14:41]
P: We can't get a 100 hours on them, Jim.

[01:11:14:45]
C: ...

[01:11:14:47]
P: Mine has been OFF now for about 8 hours.

[01:11:14:59]
P: Yes, 4 hours this time and 4 hours last time.

C: ...

[01:11:15:02]
P: You'll be asleep, too?

C: ...

[01:11:15:09]
P: Why don't we? I don't feel like sleeping again.

[01:11:15:26]
C: ...

[01:11:15:30]
P: Well, we haven't been. It's been holding right at
     940.  I think it's up to 950 now.

[01:11:15:38]
P: Okay, I'm going to ...

[01:11:15:39]
C: ...

[01:11:15:40]
P: Right.

C: ...

[01:11:16:01]
P: 03:03 ...

[01:11:16:04]
P: ... had a very important dump at Hawaii.

[01:11:16:09]
P: What is so important about these dumps?

[01:11:16:14]
P: ...

[01:11:16:21]
C: ...

[01:11:16:23]
P: You did? I just checked them a little while ago.
     Everything's holding up.

[01:11:16:28]
C: ...

[01:11:16:31]
P: No. It's down to a little under 2. It's just
     about 2.

[01:11:16:33]
C: ...

[01:11:16:38]
P: Yes, they're down to 5 now ... we've been
     running on one fan how for a long time. Day 2 ...
     We are behind on our food ...

[01:11:17:09]
P: Right. I just finished it.

[01:11:47:32]
P: CSQ, Gemini 4.

[01:11:47:35]
CC: Roger. Read you loud and clear. I have a CLA and
     PLA update for you when you're prepared to copy.

[01:11:47:50]
CC: Also, Houston would like to know - have you completed
     your Delta-8 Experiment?

[01:11:47:57]
C: Roger. We've completed the D-8 Experiment. We're
     ready to copy.

[01:11:48:02]
CC: Roger. Also be advised to leave both the Biomed
     recorders on for the reminder of the mission.

[01:11:48:11]
C: Roger. We've used them a little on the sequence.
     I think we'll leave no. 2 off for another 30 minutes.

[01:11:48:19]
CC: Okay.

[01:11:48:24]
CC: Okay. I believe you've got Area 25-3. Is that
     affirmative?

[01:11:48:29]
C: Say again.

[01:11:48:30]
CC: I say, I believe you have Area 25-3.

C: I just took pictures ... Frame 51 ...

C: I just took Frame 52 on the Hasselblad Film Pack
     no. 7 ... high deck of clouds ... very sharp
     break ... The break is ...

[01:12:00:00]
P: I've taken two pictures on the S-6, and I believe
     they are right along the inter-tropical convergence
     zone. There is a nice band of heavy cloud build-ups
     ... in a line approximately in line with the
     equator.

[01:12:00:20]
C: Golly, ... really is ... out there ...

     whether we can go for the extra ... hours.

C: Oh, no! Ha! Ha!

[01:12:03:28]
P: We got an extra load of food onboard.

[01:12:03:35]
C: ... we have fuel enough?

P: How much OAMS we got? 70 - 60?

[01:12:03:40]
C: No, 70 ...

P: Right here ...

[01:12:05:42]

_page : 183
P: I did, too.

[01:12:06:15]
C: Okay. Now, right now, ... daylight ... sure
     daylight.

[01:12:06:23]
P: Well, we're getting in dark. I can see dark here
     too, Jim. Let's see on one of these nights or days
     see what we can and can't see.

[01:12:06:40]
P: These cinnamon toasts are all right.

[01:12:06:49]
P: ... All right before. I don't think so -

[01:12:06:51]
C: I don't think so.

P: No, ... plain toast ... These are coated with
     something.

[01:12:06:52]
C: ...

[01:12:06:55]
P: Yes. Pretty good. It's all a function of how it's
     been ...

[01:12:07:00]
C: ... toast is all squashed ...

P: ...

[01:12:07:08]
C: Yes. I didn't ...

[01:12:07:12]
P: Pretty good, Jim. Try one.

[01:12:08:20]
C: Those are good.

[01:12:08:23]
P: Yes, very good.

[01:12:08:33]
C: ...

[01:12:08:35]
P: ...

[01:12:18:16]
P: Going to an extra exercise period - the second
     exercise period I've had that wasn't an official
     part of the flight.

[01:12:19:04]
P: Okay. I did it for a count of 60.

[01:12:19:09]
C: Maybe I can ...

[01:12:19:12]
P: ...

[01:12:19:13]
C: ...

[01:12:19:30]
P: Well, I started out with 5 pencils and I've got
     3 left so -

[01:12:19:35]
C: I started out with 2 and have 1 left. I mean, I
     started out with 2 and I've got 2.

[01:12:19:42]
P: Oh, yes. I put it there.

[01:12:19:45]
C: That's an opportunist ...

[01:12:19:49]
_page : 184
P: Yes.

[01:12:19:57]
P: Well, let me see. I don't know whether to put my
     gloves on or not. How's everything look over there?
     Not bad, huh? I believe I'll try it without them.
     Let me see. Where's the visor? I think you handed
     it over to me, didn't you? I'm looking right at
     the Southern Cross. Very pretty.

[01:12:20:27]
C: I think I did, Ed.

[01:12:20:28]
P: I think you did, too.

[01:12:20:54]
P: Do you want the movie camera?

[01:12:20:57]
C: Yes.

[01:12:21:05]
P: Do you want the "Y" connector? Now, I took this
     off the Hasselblad. It was fouling the pictures up.

[01:12:21:06]
C: What was?

[01:12:21:08]
P: This was.

[01:12:21:09]
C: ...

P: Oh, the shutter wasn't dropping right. It was
     dropping delayed, remember?

[01:12:21:15]
C: ...

[01:12:21:18]
P: No. Not that way, though. I had this pushed all
     the way down in. It was getting in there and sticking
     in there like this. So there's the "Y" connector
     if you want it.

[01:12:21:35]
C: ...

[01:12:21:42]
P: I've got a normal lens on it.

[01:12:21:46]
P: We're running out of what?

[01:12:21:48]
C: Hasselblad pictures.

[01:12:21:52]
P: Still not more than we had bargained for?

[01:12:23:21]
C: Sure wish I knew how our water supply was doing
     back there.

P: Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

[01:12:24:21]

[01:12:24:37]
C: ...

[01:12:24:42]
P: No way of telling, huh?

[01:12:24:47]
P: I think the lens cover's got a couple of fingermarks
     on it.

[01:12:25:15]
P: Hey, I never did find the sleeve cover.

[01:12:25:23]
C: I'm pretty sure ...

[01:12:25:25]
P: I think you did, too. I've always left it right
     there before, though ...

[01:12:25:49]
P: Turn that big spotlight off.

[01:12:25:57]
C: ...

[01:12:26:04]
C: You really ought to be able to ...

[01:12:26:17]
P: You see it over here toward me?

[01:12:26:28]
P: Yes, that we can be assured of.

[01:12:27:09]
C: ...

[01:12:27:27]
P: How about under me? See it under me anywhere?

[01:12:27:33]
P: I can reach in under there. That's the first place.
     I looked.

[01:12:27:37]
C: ... not on your suit.

[01:12:28:01]
P: That exercise eats you up in this bunny suit. I'm
     not going to do that anymore.

[01:12:28:09]
C: ...

[01:12:28:12]
P: What do you mean?

[01:12:28:13]
C: What did you do, bleed all over the seat ... ?

P: I don't know.

[01:12:28:22]

[01:12:29:07]
P: No. Not unless we do something about the hatch.

[01:12:29:16]
C: ... being able to stand up and then going outside
     through the hatch opening.

[01:12:29:21]
P: That's right.

[01:12:29:33]
P: ... it didn't look as strange from outside as it
     did from inside, from ...

[01:12:29:37]
C: Yes.

C: I reached over here one time ... a picture of
     where I thought you were.

[01:12:29:42]
P: Oh, really?

[01:12:29:45]
C: I don't know whether I got it.

[01:12:29:47]
P: Well, that lanyard - the shape of the spacecraft -
     it just kept me up here all the time. I'd go out
     here and tether dynamics would bring me back up in
     here. And then I'd operate back this way. We
     didn't think of that when we designed that anchor
     point on there.

[01:12:30:09]
C: All of our preflight plan worked out. Didn't it?

[01:12:30:16]
P: What do you mean?

[01:12:30:19]
C: ... Ha! Ha!

[01:12:30:22]
C: ...

[01:12:30:25]
P: You have daylight out in front.

[01:12:30:28]
P: But go get over on your side. But my first whole
     maneuver was done over on this side. Did you see
     me the first time I went up?

[01:12:30:35]
C: I couldn't.

[01:12:30:37]
_page : 187
P: Did you see me - Was I out in front of you one time?

[01:12:30:44]
C: Yes.

[01:12:30:45]
P: Was that when I was yawing right - left a little bit?

[01:12:30:49]
C: Yes.

[01:12:30:50]
P: Shortly thereafter was when I ran out of fuel, wasn't
     it?

[01:12:30:53]
C: Yes. It didn't last very long. It really went in
     a hurry.

[01:12:30:54]
P: Where did I use up all of my time?

[01:12:30:57]
C: I don't know. Your time or your fuel?

[01:12:31:03]
P: I was out there that long too, wasn't I?

[01:12:31:06]
C: ...

[01:12:31:09]
P: I heard him. I heard him when we finally went off
     VOX - "GET HIM IN!" Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Did you hear
     him?

[01:12:31:20]
C: Yes. I said, "Have you got any instructions for
     us?" "YEAH, GET IN!"

[01:12:31:24]
P: Ha! Ha! Ha! Who was it? Was that Gus? I thought
     it was Chris.

[01:12:31:30]
P: I think at that time I was standing on top of the
     spacecraft. No, I wasn't. I was out there. That
     was when I saw Cuba, wasn't it?

[01:12:32:16]
C: Hey, Ed!

[01:12:32:18]
P: I'm trying.

[01:12:32:23]
P: That ... cool it down.

[01:12:32:31]
P: I've got to sit down and tape more on that tape
     than I have ...

[01:12:32:46]
P: Have to get my ... and get a good ... on getting
     out of the spacecraft. What we need is a big spacecraft
     with a big inward opening hatch - just like
     they have on a submarine.

[01:12:33:17]
C: Port opening?

[01:12:33:18]
P: Yes, so that the pressure inside seals the hatch.

[01:12:33:25]
C: ...

[01:12:33:28]
P: No. You have to have a ...

[01:12:33:39]
P: This is pretty ...

[01:12:33:42]
_page : 188
C: Right here?

[01:12:33:44]
P: Yes.

[01:12:33:46]
C: ...

[01:12:33:52]
P: I think we've got to do something better. They've
     been trying all types of things -

[01:12:33:59]
P: Look at that thunder and lightning storm.

[01:12:34:01]
C: ...

[01:12:34:03]
P: Yes.

[01:12:34:04]
P: I wonder where we are, Jim?

[01:12:34:08]
C: ...

[01:12:34:10]
P: Let me just check these and then I'll go to sleep.

[01:12:34:14]
C: ... to get tired of it.

[01:12:34:16]
P: Okay.

[01:12:34:22]
C: ...

[01:12:34:25]
P: You're right. I hate to go to sleep.

[01:12:34:40]
P: Let's just check what time those are and then we
     can find out where we were later.

[01:12:34:44]
C: ...

[01:12:34:45]
P: Okay.

[01:12:34:46]
C: ...

[01:12:34:49]
P: Saw a great many thunderstorms down below us. It
     looks like we're going approximately small-end-forward
     and we're upside down. Very, very heavy
     thunder and lightning activity. And the time is -
     what was that time, Jim?

[01:12:35:20]
C: 10 ti11 4.

[01:12:35:21]
P: 10 till 4?

[01:12:35:22]
C: Right.

[01:12:35:24]
P: And I'm going to sleep. We're going blunt-end-forward
     because the stars are setting.

[01:12:57:11]
C: We're presently over the Arabian Peninsula at 04:13.

[01:12:57:23]
C: Taking pictures of some of the sand dunes down here.

P: ... the recorder ...

[01:12:58:24]

CC: Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.

[01:13:55:33]
C: Go ahead, RKV CAP COM.

[01:13:55:36]
CC: Roger. Would you give us the blood pressure please?

[01:13:55:52]
S: Gemini 4, RKV Surgeon. Would you pump it up a little
     more, please?

[01:13:55:58]
S: I'll give you full-scale when you're there.

[01:13:56:15]
S: RKV Surgeon. Try it there.

[01:13:56:24]
S: Gemini 4, this is RKV Surgeon. You're getting a
     phased run-down on your blood pressure. Would you
     check your setting to be sure it's in?

[01:13:56:52]
S: Roger Gemini 4, this is RKV Surgeon. You are still
     not getting a good blood pressure but before you
     try it next time would you check your fitting end
     be sure you don't have some loose trash or something
     inside the O-ring.

[01:13:57:10]
C: This is Gemini 4... the blood pressure.

[01:13:57:20]
S: Roger. We got - we're getting good blood pressures
     from Ed, so keep trying it for a while. Could you
     go ahead and get your water and sleep report now,
     though.

[01:13:57:53]
C: Okay ... last four hour period ... I got about
     an hours worth of sleep ...

[01:13:58:04]

     Meal A of the second day?

[01:13:58:10]
C: The second day ... Meal A of the second.

[01:13:58:25]
S: RKV Surgeon. Roger. CAP COM has something for you.

[01:13:58:31]
CC: Roger. Have you checked your wet and dry bulb
     temperatures as of yet?

[01:13:58:39]
_page : 190
CC: Gemini 4, RKV.

[01:13:58:41]
C: Go ahead, RKV.

[01:13:58:43]
CC: Roger. Have you taken your wet and dry bulb temperature
     readings?

[01:13:58:48]
C: Roger. We've been taking them right along.

[01:13:58:50]
CC: Roger. Could you give me a read out?

[01:13:58:52]
C: Stand by one.

[01:13:59:08]
C: Dry bulb between about 72 and 79. A little bit before
     that they ran between 75 and 77. Wet bulb last
     group was between 57 and 61. Preceding group between
     60 and 65. Let me get you a relative humidity here.

[01:14:06:39]
C: It's approximately 05:25, passing over South America.
     Whole series of thunderstorms down there that are
     bright enough to be actually shining up into the
     spacecraft. Very, very violent.

[01:14:19:05]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.

[01:14:19:18]
C: Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.

[01:14:19:20]
CC: Roger, Gemini 4. Reading you loud and clear. Did
     you get your map update for revolution 25?

[01:14:19:26]
C: Roger. It was 3° West and 05:36.

[01:14:19:32]
CC: Roger, 5 west 05:33. Did you get the S-6 experiment
     update?

[01:14:19:38]
C: Negative. What did you have to say about that?

[01:14:19:40]
CC: Okay. Typhoon Babe is still off Formosa. You will
     be over it at 06:06. Weather advises there's a new
     storm area that you will be over at 06:13 G.m.t.
     We'd like some pictures if you can get them. No
     fuel usage. Did you copy that?

[01:14:20:21]
CC: Gemini 4, this is Houston. Did you copy the S-6?

[01:14:20:37]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.

[01:14:21:02]
CC: Gemini 4, Gemini 4. This is Houston. I will give
     you a 27-BRAVO update if you can read. It is a
     split burn. Forward 76. Aft 94. 2+07. 1+58. 09 12 06. 9+30. Did you copy? Over.

_page : 191
C: Roger. Could you give us back your last dry and
     wet bulb temperature on your humidity check?

[01:14:22:29]
C: Roger. They were about 75 and 77, but our humidity
     was around 60 percent.

[01:14:22:37]
CC: Roger. Copied that. If you can, get your left and
     right cabin wall temperatures using the thermostat.
     Also, report on visible moisture, if any, and is
     your blotting paper wet to the touch? Over.

[01:14:23:00]
C: Roger. The - I took the wall temperature quite some
     time ago in the left-hand food box and it was 75.
     The blotting paper is not wet to the touch, and
     there is no visible moisture.

[01:14:23:14]
CC: Understand no moisture and not wet to the touch.
     Could you give me an estimate on the completion of
     your experiments D-9, S-6, and S-5, or roughly how
     much you've done on that?

[01:14:23:29]
C: We haven't been able to do anything with D-9 that
     was when we could record any data. We are going
     to... We ... For S-6 we need one long pass
     over the United States to take a series of 35 pictures
     across the southwestern United States. ...
     to point the spacecraft down at the ground while we
     take a string of pictures.

[01:14:23:53]
CC: Understand you need one more pass on S-5 and you
     have a fair amount of S-6. Is that affirmative?

[01:14:24:00]
C: We have a fair amount of S-6. We've had some
     scattered S-5 sightings ... pictures, but we need
     one run over the United States at least, and we'd
     like another one over the - over North Africa if
     we can work it in.

[01:14:24:14]
CC: Understand. I copied that. For your target of opportunity
     on these experiments, we'd like to give
     them a priority of no. 1, S-5; no. 2, S-6; and
     no. 3, D-9, if possible.

[01:14:24:35]
C: Roger, it's going to be pretty tough to get a D-9
     without any fuel.

[01:14:24:39]
CC: That's affirmative. D-9 without any fuel.

[01:14:25:04]
CC: Gemini 4, that's all from Houston. We'll be standing
     by. We have about 1 minute to LOS.

CC: Roger, you're coming in real good. We have an
     Apollo landmark for you. Are you prepared to copy?

[01:15:28:38]
C: All I received was are we prepared to copy. Are we
     prepared to copy what?

[01:15:28:44]
CC: Roger, it's an Apollo landmark.

[01:15:28:50]
C: Stand by a second.

[01:15:28:58]
C: Okay. Go ahead.

[01:15:29:00]
CC: Roger, it's Cairo in the 26th rev. G.m.t. 07 18 37.
     12 miles northwest, that is northwest of the track.
     Slant range 90 nautical miles.

[01:15:29:43]
CC: Gemini 4, do you copy?

[01:15:29:44]
C: Roger, Cairo on the 26th rev. G.m.t. 07 18 37.
     12 nautical miles northwest of track. 90 miles
     slant range.

[01:15:29:57]
CC: That's affirmative. Our Surgeon would like to talk
     to you.

[01:15:30:03]
S: Gemini 4, RKV Surgeon.

[01:15:30:04]
C: Roger, RKV Surgeon. Go ahead.

[01:15:30:07]
S: Roger, I have a couple of questions for you. First,
     about the blood pressure. I don't want to bug you
     very much on it, but did you change the O-ring?

[01:15:30:17]
_page : 193
C: No I didn't. I looked at the O-ring and I don't
     think it's the O-ring. I think it's my ... I
     noticed when I got checked out the other morning
     just before launch, that they had a little trouble
     with it then. I ... the blood pressure moves.
     It looks like a problem with my suit. Would you
     like for me to try to give you another one?

[01:15:30:39]
S: Negative, there's no reason to do that right now.
     I have some more questions for you. If you aren't
     doing anything towards the end of the pass, we could
     try it.

[01:15:30:46]
C: Okay.

[01:15:30:50]
S: First, a couple of questions on your general condition.
     How restful do you think your sleep is?

[01:15:30:57]
C: Well, it's not very restful. This radio feeds
     through into the other helmet, he can hear it,
     not very loud, he's got his ... but he can hear
     all the radio transmissions and ... it keeps waking
     you up.

[01:15:31:13]
S: Roger, do you feel like you are dry or dehydrated?

[01:15:31:20]
C: No, possibly I did notice, oh, at the end of about
     the 6th or 7th pass, I drank quite a bit of water
     ... And got to feeling better. I've been eating
     and drinking right along now so I don't feel
     dehydrated at all.

[01:15:31:35]
S: Roger, your voice sounds a little dry to us down
     here and you do think you are getting enough water
     to drink now?

[01:15:31:42]
C: Yes sir, I think I'm being dried out by the oxygen.
     My nose did bleed ... after launch.

[01:15:31:54]
S: Roger. Jim, go ahead and keep pumping the water
     down because we have plenty aboard.

[01:15:32:00]
C: Well, I hate to run out, you know, after only 3 days.

[01:15:32:04]
C: Roger, White is drinking a good bit. I'm just about
     to start on my meal B of the second day, and Ed's
     sleeping now and when he gets up, he's going to eat
     his.

[01:15:32:17]
S: Roger, if you have some time now you may give me a
     blood pressure.

[01:15:32:21]
C: Okay.

[01:15:32:54]
S: You are full-scale - Beautiful! - That's a beautiful
     record, Jim.

[01:15:33:26]
_page : 194
S: Gemini 4, RKV Surgeon. That's a good record. We
     have a good blood pressure on you.

[01:15:33:31]
C: Okay, very good. I think I give you a good one
     every third or fourth time.

[01:15:33:37]
S: Good average.

[01:15:33:44]
S: Gemini 4, RKV Surgeon. We have nothing else. We'll
     stand by for your comments if you have any.

[01:15:33:49]
_extra : Section (CARNARVON REMOTED)
C: Roger. I think I'll ... I imagine we're powering
     ... at the end of 4 days, besides from that we're
     in pretty good shape right now.

C: ... , this is Gemini 4.

[01:15:53:18]
CC: Roger, Gemini 4, I'd like to explain this split-burn
     to you. Over.

[01:15:53:37]
CC: Gemini 4, Gemini 4, anytime your OAMS burn is greater
     than 120 ft/sec, we will give you a split-burn,
     84 feet out of the forward thrusters and the balance
     out of the aft thrusters. Do you understand? Over.

[01:15:54:03]
C: Okay, anytime OAMS is greater than 120 ft/sec, I am
     going to get 84 - 84 out of the forward and the rest
     out of the aft.

[01:15:54:10]
CC: Roger, you got it, Jim. We will be standing by at
     all of these remote sites. I'll just give you a
     call and say, "Standing by" and if you get lonesome
     and you have any comments, you can come on up, and
     we have a few personal messages here from the doctor.
     Over.

[01:15:54:28]
C: Okay.

[01:15:54:33]
S: Gemini 4, this is Houston Surgeon. I have a message
     for the Command Pilot. Little League score: the
     Hawks, 3; the Pelicans, 2; and Mike 1.

[01:15:55:01]
S: Gemini 4, this is Houston Surgeon. Do you read?

[01:15:55:05]
C: I sure do.

S: Did you copy the score for the Hawk-Pelican game?

[01:15:55:10]
_page : 195
C: Boy, did I ever!

[01:15:55:12]
S: Roger, a message for the Pilot. The Dodgers 11, the
     Yankees 10, and Eddie had 1 for 3.

[01:15:55:22]
C: Okay, he's sleeping right now, but I'll tell him
     when he wakes up.

[01:15:55:26]
S: Roger, you can also advise him that his wife received
     the flowers and she forgot to tell him that
     today when she was on air-to-ground.

[01:15:55:35]
C: Okay.

[01:15:55:37]
S: Houston Surgeon out.

[01:15:55:39]
CC: Jim, this is CAP COM. You also might tell the Pilot
     when he wakes up that Jim's here, and he's going to
     give him one more chance to change seats with him.

[01:15:55:48]
C: Ha!

[01:15:55:54]
S: Hey, Jim, this is Shakey, the Assistant Surgeon.
     How's the waste management coming along?

[01:15:55:58]
C: ... I want to know whose heart rate was the highest
     the other day.

[01:15:56:06]
S: Hey, James. This is Shakey, the Assistant Surgeon.
     How's the waste management coming along?

[01:15:56:12]
C: Hey, listen, the only free water we've got in here
     is every time we've tried to use that urine system.

[01:15:56:31]

P: I can see a black fire down on the desert. You can
     see right down to the very source where it's coming
     from. I couldn't see exactly what it was, but it
     made a very, very distinct mark on the ground. I've
     taken several S-5 terrain pictures as we crossed the
     desert at 07:17. Feels like we've got a failure in
     magazine no. 7. It feels like one of the dogs isn't
     catching down on the film or the film's bailing up.
     I don't know. I don't believe we'll get much out
     of it.

P: Roger, we used Pulse Control in a minimum amount;
     the target of number 12 was obscured by clouds; I
     had the time and location pretty well squared away.
     I could have tracked if I could have seen the target,
     I believe. Target number 13, it was in the
     clear, and I was able to pick up the city of
     Alexandria. The airport I think I ... but I
     haven't been able to put my attention on looking
     for the airport. I could have spotted the airport.
     I went ahead and operated the camera and took some
     pictures as I passed over it. The location of the
     target from the data called up was satisfactory.

     5 minutes of this experiment with the ACQ Aid
     Beacon OFF when there are no UHF transmissions.

[01:21:56:22]
C: Do you want me to go to REAL TIME-DELAYED TIME or
     do you want me to turn OFF the ACQ Aid with the
     circuit breaker?

[01:21:56:28]
CC: Roger. Use the circuit breaker.

[01:21:56:30]
C: Okay.

[01:21:56:38]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston. We'd like a repeat of your food
     and water report.

[01:21:56:42]
C: From the Pilot, or do you want to do one from me?

[01:21:56:45]
CC: That's from the Pilot, please.

[01:21:56:53]
P: Roger. This is the Pilot. About 3 hours ago, I
     had Meal 2, day 2. I had about 4 or 5 swallows of
     water. I had a successful yes on defecation bag.

[01:21:57:12]
CC: Roger, Gemini 4.

[01:21:57:19]
C: Houston, this is Gemini 4. I just got up. Where
     are we? What station are we passing over right now?

[01:21:57:28]
CC: Roger. We have you Bermuda right now. You just
     passed through Texas and Canaveral (Kennedy).

[01:21:57:32]
C: Roger.

[01:21:57:34]
CC: Good morning, Jim. How do you feel?

[01:21:57:37]
_page : 206
C: Oh, pretty good.

[01:21:57:39]
CC: Sound great.

[01:21:57:41]
C: Thank you. How are you?

[01:21:57:44]
CC: Had a good night's sleep.

[01:21:57:47]
C: I got a little more sleep this time than I have in
     the past.

[01:21:57:49]
CC: How about that plug in your throat there. Have
     you taken that out when you were sleeping?

[01:21:58:01]
C: Oh. Negative, I didn't disconnect my radio. I
     left it on.

[01:21:58:05]
CC: Did it bother you at all?

[01:21:58:08]
C: It has been up till now, but this time I guess I
     was pretty tired, and I slept without it.

[01:21:58:13]
CC: Very good. ... Gemini 4, Houston. You can turn
     your Quantity Read Switch OFF now.

[01:21:58:30]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. You can turn your
     Quantity Read Switch OFF.

[01:21:58:34]
C: Roger, it's OFF.

[01:21:58:38]
CC: Roger, you're looking good here. Have a good day.

[01:21:58:41]
C: Roger.

[01:21:59:12]
CC: Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. We have your
     O<sub>2</sub> tank pressures around 970.

[01:21:59:21]
C: Okay. We're reading about 960. We'll dump ...

[01:21:59:25]
CC: Okay. Understand.

[01:22:05:10]
S: When was this going ON?

[01:22:05:15]
_extra : Section CANARY ISLANDS
C: Cabin temperature is going ON at 13:22.

[01:22:05:29]
CC: Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.

[01:22:05:31]
C: Go ahead, Canary, Gemini 4.

[01:22:05:34]
CC: Roger. Request that you use the Cabin Recheck Valve
     instead of O<sub>2</sub> High Rate. Also, be advised that
     Houston says do not relieve through the cabin if you
     can avoid it.

C: We don't need a push.

[01:22:05:54]
_page : 207
C: We don't have any other place to put the oxygen
     except in the cabin. We've just finished doing it
     to the O<sub>2</sub> High Rate. We got the ECS O<sub>2</sub> pressure
     down to 910.

[01:22:06:02]
CC: Roger. They were warning you to avoid relieving
     through the cabin area.

[01:22:06:06]
C: O<sub>2</sub> pressure down to 910.

[01:22:06:09]
CC: Roger. I understand 910.

[01:22:06:10]
C: Can you tell me why they want to use the Repress
     instead of the O<sub>2</sub> High Rate? Where else would we
     put the oxygen?

[01:22:06:20]
CC: Roger.

[01:22:06:24]
P: Jim, we're not ...

[01:22:06:30]
C: Well, he said that in order to get MSC-1 they wanted
     the ACQ Aid Beacon OFF for 5 minutes. You know,
     you were going to leave - to do some ECS on and
     off ... thruster.

[01:22:06:41]
P: Okay.

[01:22:06:50]
P: Cabin temperature comes ON at - I put it ON already.

[01:22:06:53]
C: I don't know ...

[01:22:06:58]
C: ...

[01:22:07:03]
CC: Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.

[01:22:07:05]
C: Go ahead.

[01:22:07:07]
CC: Roger. The reason for using the Repress was to
     avoid turning off your fans and to cut down on your
     noise level in your cabin.

[01:22:07:17]
C: Okay.

[01:22:07:20]
CC: They meant do not relieve overboard if you can avoid
     it.

[01:22:07:26]
C: Oh, don't ... they don't want to vent the ECS O<sub>2</sub>
     tank overboard directly. They want to vent it overboard
     through the cabin. Is that it?

[01:22:07:34]
CC: They don't want to avoid overboard at all if possible.

[01:22:07:36]
C: Roger, I know it.

[01:22:07:52]
_page : 208
CC: Okay. Your O<sub>2</sub> usage for the last 24 hours -- correction
     -- over the last 2 or 3 hours has been
     25 percent higher than normal.

[01:22:08:00]
C: Roger. Our cabin's been holding all right. There
     really doesn't seem to be much we can do about that.
     That tank pressure goes up and that is just about
     all there is to it. We're actually venting oxygen
     overboard that we don't need to.

[01:22:08:14]
CC: Roger.

[01:22:08:19]
C: How is our O<sub>2</sub> consumption? I've been plotting it
     and it looks like we're in reasonably good shape.

[01:22:08:40]
P: It doesn't really call out for my time hack ...

[01:22:08:44]
C: Okay.

[01:22:08:50]
P: ... get a drink of something.

[01:22:08:52]
C: I'm thirsty.

[01:22:08:56]
CC: Your rate even at your present rate - you have 5 or
     10 hours more than you need plus secondary O<sub>2</sub>.

[01:22:09:03]
C: Okay, fine. Thank you.

[01:22:09:07]
C: And I'll try to take your advice and not vent any
     overboard, but I just don't know how I'm going to
     do that.

[01:22:09:12]
CC: Roger, we understand.

[01:22:10:00]
P: You know, it's going to be tough getting 14 ...
     recording ...

[01:22:10:05]
C: Aw, hell no.

[01:22:38:59]
C: All right, Carnarvon. Gemini 4.

[01:22:39:01]
CC: Roger, what's your status?

[01:22:39:03]
C: We're in good shape.

[01:22:39:04]
_page : 209
CC: Roger. You're looking real good here on the ground.
     I'd like a few readouts from you.

[01:22:39:10]
C: Okay.

[01:22:39:11]
CC: I'd like OAMS source helium temp, pressure, and
     propellant quantity.

[01:22:39:35]
C: Propellant quantity - I have about 61 percent remaining.
     It fluctuates a little between there and
     about 63.

[01:22:39:43]
CC: Roger. How about your helium temp and helium pressure?
     OAMS source helium temp and OAMS source
     helium pressure.

[01:22:40:04]
P: The helium temperature is 58 and the pressure is
     under 2000.

[01:22:40:12]
CC: You say a little under what?

[01:22:40:15]
C: ...

[01:22:40:16]
CC: Roger.

[01:22:40:56]
CC: Okay, we're standing by here on the ground if you
     need anything.

[01:22:40:57]
C: We're preparing to do Experiment D-9, and we probably
     won't have any transmissions for you.

[01:22:41:05]
CC: Okay. Very good.

[01:22:58:40]
CC: Go ahead.

[01:22:58:43]
P: We are starting the first run of Apollo. We have D-9, Ru (illegible)

P: We haven't picked up Antares, yet. I guess we have
     5 minutes to do so, though.

[01:22:58:52]
P: ... Antares.

[01:22:59:04]
C: ...

[01:22:59:12]
P: ...

[01:22:59:26]
C: Looks to me like we're a little ... this Flight
     Plan.

[01:22:59:33]
P: Is that Antares coming up there now?

[01:23:00:14]
P: ... yawed too far to the left.

[01:23:00:16]
C: What?

[01:23:00:17]
P: Corona Australis is coming up.

[01:23:00:43]
C: ...

[01:23:00:55]
_page : 210
P: That's the Corona Borealis that should be coming up.

C: Yes, that's the one ...

[01:23:00:57]
P: Yes.

[01:23:01:09]
P: Is it coming in your side?

C: Yes ...

[01:23:01:21]
P: Yes, that's right. We're yawed around to the right.

[01:23:01:36]
C: Yes, how's the horizon look?

[01:23:01:41]
P: My horizon's real good.

[01:23:01:48]
P: Just coming in.

[01:23:01:51]
P: High? ... up?

[01:23:01:52]
C: Straight up above.

[01:23:01:55]
P: Okay. Stand by.

[01:23:01:56]
C: Yes, I know. I don't know how they expect us to
     sight ...

[01:23:02:02]
P: Shucks.

[01:23:02:07]
P: It's an awfully high one to give us.

[01:23:02:12]
P: ...

[01:23:02:15]
C: ...

[01:23:02:17]
C: Okay, now you ought to be able to see something
     without any trouble.

[01:23:02:26]
P: The sky?

[01:23:02:36]
P: ... come on, yet.

[01:23:02:38]
C: ... Southern Cross ... star chart. We ought to
     be able to see that.

[01:23:02:48]
P: ...

[01:23:03:04]
P: I think I see Antares. I can never get down - not
     in my view.

[01:23:03:14]
P: ...

P: Clear at the top of my window.

[01:23:03:19]
C: Yes ...

[01:23:03:21]
P: I can't possibly - I can't get this down underneath
     far enough. There, hold on.

[01:23:03:31]
C: ...

[01:23:03:48]
_page : 211
P: Way up too high for me.

[01:23:03:50]
C: Too high?

[01:23:03:52]
P: Yes, way too high. I can't possibly get it unless
     you pitch up to it and yaw back down.

[01:23:04:02]
P: No, - yes, but we didn't get it. I've got Gemini
     coming up now. No, that's not Gemini, that's part
     of the Southern Cross.

[01:23:04:19]
P: No, it crossed right through - high.

[01:23:04:26]
P: Yes, I saw it go across the very top of my window.
     Is that where it was on yours?

[01:23:04:38]
C: Right now, you're not even seeing ...

[01:23:04:43]
P: Okay, now I think it's coming where I can see it.

[01:23:04:57]
C: You've got to have a whole segment ...

[01:23:05:07]
C: I can take a sighting on it now ...

[01:23:05:14]
P: Yes, I got a sighting from it.

[01:23:05:16]
C: Did you?

[01:23:05:17]
P: Yes.

[01:23:05:52]
C: ...

P: Roll to the right.

C: ...

[01:23:05:57]
P: Huh?

C: ...

[01:23:06:02]
P: Yes, roll it.

[01:23:06:07]
P: Yes, the horizon is gone and I ... The star's
     too high with respect to the horizon.

[01:23:06:14]
C: I know it ... way, way, way too early.

[01:23:06:43]
P: You got to put ... in?

[01:23:07:02]
C: ... up. They're in.

[01:23:07:19]
P: Hey, I thought I ...

[01:23:07:24]
P: I'll get the ...

[01:23:07:28]
C: ... be perpendicular unless we wait till it gets
     down lower.

C: Get back up ...

[01:23:07:52]
_page : 212
P: ...

[01:23:08:38]
P: It's gone out the top of my window now, Jim. I've
     got too much horizon.

[01:23:08:43]
P: Yes, that's just too big an angle in there.

[01:23:08:50]
P: It's only 23° right now ...

[01:23:09:02]
C: ...

[01:23:09:28]
P: Can you roll it to the left a little bit; I have
     too much horizon now.

C: That's what I think. How about rolling it just
     horizontal?

[01:23:09:50]
P: Oh, boy, there goes all the "O" rings.

[01:23:09:57]
C: Okay.

[01:23:10:02]
C: I can't get the horizon.

[01:23:10:04]
P: Okay.

[01:23:10:33]
C: How are you?

[01:23:10:38]
C: I can't ... star.

[01:23:10:52]
P: The horizon's gone now.

[01:23:10:55]
C: When?

[01:23:10:56]
P: I don't have a horizon anymore.

[01:23:10:58]
C: Disappeared.

[01:23:10:59]
P: Yes.

[01:23:11:02]
C: Same here with me. I don't know whether I'm up,
     down, sideways, or anything else. I like to at
     least know the orientation.

[01:23:11:07]
P: Okay, we never got a good one on that.

[01:23:11:09]
C: Okay, we've been running into problems.

[01:23:11:12]
P: We tried to get Antares twice.

[01:23:11:36]
C: Can you see into this side?

[01:23:11:38]
P: Not ... try bring myself around.

[01:23:11:43]
C: You can control it if you like.

[01:23:11:48]
P: I might be able to get it better that way.

[01:23:12:12]
P: Where'd my book go?

[01:23:12:28]
C: Oh, shoot!

[01:23:12:40]
C: ... horizon comes back ...

[01:23:12:45]
_page : 213
P: Okay, I got it. But before I can shoot any stars
     I've got to get this stuff behind me, or I won't
     see a star. What are you looking for? Okay. I've
     got it pitched this way and roll it back in there
     or I won't see anything.

[01:23:13:16]
P: I guess it's not.

[01:23:13:21]
C: See any stars?

[01:23:13:26]
P: A few stars - okay. Yaw more to the right.

P: Okay. The stars are back out again.

[01:23:13:38]
C: No, I didn't expect ...

[01:23:13:52]
P: What I have to do is keep my window shaded all of
     the time.

[01:23:13:55]
C: Yes.

P: Out of the sun and then I can see.

[01:23:13:58]
C: Oh yes, I can see stars.

[01:23:14:07]
P: ... of the stars in ... 178, that's pretty good ...

[01:23:14:14]
C: ...

[01:23:14:24]
P: I haven't got any horizon pictures..

C: ...

[01:23:14:31]
P: No, what I see now ...

[01:23:14:38]
P: What I wanted to try to do ... Are you dark over
     there?

[01:23:14:45]
P: ...

[01:23:14:57]
C: ...

[01:23:15:15]
P: I don't see the stars. Do you?

[01:23:15:26]
P: ... one time.

[01:23:15:31]
P: I'm supposed to have the proper attitude.

[01:23:15:40]
P: I can roll back over now, though.

[01:23:15:48]
P: ...

[01:23:15:50]
C: Yes. ...

[01:23:16:38]
P: Got to keep the horizon in there.

[01:23:17:16]
C: ...

[01:23:17:23]
P: I don't think we do. I'm in a good black now.

[01:23:17:26]
_page : 214
C: ...

[01:23:17:28]
P: As far as the shade. I'm shaded enough ...

[01:23:17:31]
C: ... the star and the sky.

[01:23:17:38]
P: Neither can I.

[01:23:17:43]
C: ...

[01:23:17:45]
P: Okay, you go ahead and see if you can find any.

[01:23:17:47]
C: ...

[01:23:17:52]
P: They're just not there.

[01:23:17:55]

[01:23:18:02]
P: Okay.

[01:23:18:04]
C: ... the recorder OFF.

C: ... the recorder OFF.

[01:23:18:16]
C: ...

P: ...

[01:23:18:28]
P: Yes, ...

[01:23:18:33]
C: Okay, we're starting to pitch up close to the horizon
     now, and ...

[01:23:18:43]
C: Okay. Blunt-end-forward so the sun's behind us.

[01:23:18:48]
C: I still see no stars.

[01:23:18:50]
P: No, neither can I.

[01:23:19:02]
C: I have a black sky out there, but I'm getting reflection
     off the window. How about you?

[01:23:19:07]
P: Yes, I get a lot of reflections off that dirty outside
     part.

[01:23:19:11]
C: Half of my window is black and the other has a little
     sun shining on it. Sun shining on the nose of the
     spacecraft so I've got to look past a lighted object.
     I don't see a star, and I never have seen the stars
     in the daylight... much better at sunrise when
     half the spacecraft is dark and the other half is
     light.

[01:23:19:31]
P: Yes, then you can see it.

[01:23:19:35]
C: Okay, my window's in the sunlight. How about yours?

[01:23:19:39]
P: Mine's in sunlight too ...

[01:23:19:47]
_page : 215
C: Heck, I guess that what we're saying is that ...
     [Experiment] D-9 cannot be done in the daylight.

[01:23:20:02]
P: I concur.

[01:23:20:07]
P: Right now, there doesn't seem to be a way for us to
     find any stars in the daylight.

C: No, it sure doesn't. There's no way you can see
     them.

[01:23:20:10]
P: There is certainly no way to do it after ...

[01:23:20:19]
P: Okay.

[01:23:20:28]
C: ... a long window. A window that has a long ...
     off the window where you can look straight off the ...

[01:23:20:38]
P: ...

[01:23:20:40]
C: ... okay, ... look out ...

[01:23:21:43]
C: I don't see a star anywhere.

P: I know I can't. I've got direct sunshine on my
     window.

[01:23:21:50]
C: ...

[01:23:21:55]
P: ...

[01:23:21:59]
C: ... nose of the spacecraft.

[01:23:22:02]
P: Yes.

[01:23:22:19]
P: Yes ...

[01:23:22:21]
P: Okay.

[01:23:23:33]
C: My window's not in the light anymore, and I still
     don't see the stars. If there's any possibility in
     the world to see stars in the daylight and horizon
     at the same time, I'm in the position right now
     where I should be able to do it. And don't have
     the sun on the nose of the spacecraft. It's on the

     single star, not a single star.

C: Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.

[01:23:23:40]
CC: Roger, are you busy with [Experiment] D-9?

[01:23:23:43]
C: No, I think it just drew to a close. We just can't
     see the stars in the daylight, and we can't carry on
     the daylight portion of it. We'll wait till we get
     back to the nighttime and do a little bit more with
     that.

CC: Roger, Jim. I want to talk to you about this O<sub>2</sub>
     high usage rate thing.

[01:23:24:00]
C: Okay.

[01:23:24:01]
CC: We don't think it's any problem. We would like for
     you to put your Quantity Read Switch ON and leave
     it on for the next several hours so we can get a
     feel for what's going on. Even at the rate that's
     been used in the last several hours, it won't be
     any problem, but we'd like to find some way to control
     this thing without it being a nuisance to use
     so you won't be bothered with it. That's the reason
     we want to take a look at it for some time. Don't
     like the idea of you having to reduce pressures or
     build up pressure every few minutes. Do you read
     me?

[01:23:24:41]
C: Houston, Gemini 4. I got the part where we leave
     the Read Switch ON for a while, and then all the
     rest cut off. Say again.

[01:23:24:59]
CC: Okay. Jim, how do you read me now?

[01:23:25:05]
C: ... for the next couple hours. Say after that.

CC: Wait till we get Bermuda acquisition. I'll try you
     there.

[01:23:26:36]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston. How do you read now?

[01:23:26:45]
P: Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.

[01:23:26:50]
CC: What I was saying - we want to get a hack on what's
     going on with that pressure buildup in the Primary
     O<sub>2</sub> system. We want to try to find some way to control
     it without you having to relieve cabin pressure
     every few minutes or every few hours, so this is the
     reason we want your Quantity Read Switch ON for the
     next several hours.

[01:23:27:11]
C: Okay. What did you say about my usage rate?

[01:23:27:15]
CC: It's a little bit higher than it has been, but it
     is nothing to worry about. You have plenty so don't
     be concerned about it.

[01:23:27:24]
_page : 217
C: Okay. I've been plotting it, and it looks like
     we're going to end up with 7 or 8 percent remaining.

[01:23:27:33]
CC: Yes, we're just trying to find some way to keep you
     from having to relieve the cabin pressure every now
     and then.

[01:23:27:44]
C: Okay. Yes, I don't like that either.

[01:23:27:46]
CC: Yes.

[01:23:28:08]
CC: The Flight Surgeon would like to know if either one
     of you had any trouble with drying around the eyes
     or dry throat.

[01:23:28:17]
C: My throat is a little dry, and our eyes were bothering
     us about the end of the first day quite a bit,
     but that's all cleared up now.

[01:23:28:25]
CC: Okay. Very good.

[01:23:28:32]
C: Hey, Gus. Can you get me a G.m.t. hack?

[01:23:28:35]
CC: Roger. I'll give it to you at 14 45 00. In about
     20 seconds.

C: Roger. 14 45 ...

[01:23:28:50]
CC: Ten seconds to go.

[01:23:28:57]
CC: 14 45 00 on my mark.

[01:23:29:00]
CC: MARK!

[01:23:29:02]
C: Roger, 14 45 00.

[01:23:29:10]
CC: Any complaints?

[01:23:29:13]
C: No, except this thing isn't very big.

[01:23:29:46]
CC: On your next pass over the States we'll have the
     latest news for you.

[01:23:29:58]
C: Okay, very good.

[01:23:30:43]
C: Ed and I were just commenting that the weightlessness
     gives you a light-headed feeling, a heady
     feeling.

[01:23:32:43]
P: But not a heady feeling ...

[01:23:32:45]
C: Yes, I did, and Ed was saying that his headache is
     gone. He had one earlier.

[01:23:32:50]
C: And I don't have one yet, but I feel closer to
     having one now than I have had at any time. I
     think it's this darn 100 percent oxygen. I breathe
     it in and I don't think I've ever been this dry.
     With the worst cold I've ever had, where I can't
     breathe through my nose and I sound like I've got
     a big deep cold. I sound to myself like I'm very
     ... but I can now if I - I was when I was sleeping,
     too. But it was burning my nose, actually, when I
     was sleeping. I had a very hoarse sound to myself.
     Do I sound that way to you, too?

[01:23:33:23]
_page : 218
P: Yes.

[01:23:33:26]
C: ... But I think because of this 100 percent oxygen
     where I kept assimilating it. I suspect that
     maybe my ears and my sinuses are always below ambient
     and I know I've got to pop my ears about every
     hour or two.

[01:23:33:40]
P: I have a little ...

[01:23:33:48]
C: Yes, my mouth and my throat are quite dry at this

     can through it.

[01:23:55:53]

[01:23:56:33]
C: I think it does too, Ed.

[01:23:56:38]
C: Okay, now half of what I see is light and the other
     half is dark. So we're going a little bit sideways
     to the small-end-forward, but Ed's side is in the
     dark completely, I believe. Isn't it, Ed?

[01:23:56:50]
P: I see a star ...

C: Okay. First star was at 15:12 - 15 12 52 it was.

     part. Do you have that impression too, Ed?

P: ...

[01:23:57:54]
C: No, I think the gradation of this goop that's all
     over it, whatever it is, looks like it's on about
     here on up - looks like it's on about the zero
     pitch line on up.

[01:23:58:06]
P: There's plenty of stars out there, now.

[01:23:58:09]
C: Okay, I still don't have any stars.

[01:23:58:21]
P: There's a very pretty horizon out there now.

[01:23:58:26]
C: Okay, I have my first star. - I'm quite sure that
     this coating on my window is about zero pitch attitude
     line on up. I can see a star down below that
     ... you'd think I'd be able to see it. It might
     just be the peculiar way the reflections are coming
     back through the window.

[01:23:59:11]
C: Okay, Edward, I'm going to leave the recorder on
     until it runs out.

     got a pretty good measure on it the next time. The
     ... using no filter, I used the top of the glow
     of the thick layer of the air glow. It's a rather
     nebulous -- you've got to kind of calibrate your own

     make these measurements. You can't expect to make
     these measurements without using any fuel. It's
     such a small window, you have to pick up your star
     and bring it down to the horizon keeping the horizon
     and the star in your field of view.

     daylight side with the earth shine and not in view.
     Just forget the sextant; just get dark adapted the
     best you can on the daylight side and see if you
     can pick out some stars.

[02:00:55:09]
C: Roger, we tried that and we can't -- we were not
     able to pick out any stars on the daylight side.

     about seeing that satellite up there yesterday.
     Also, the conversation with the wives is getting

     the Dome may be the eighth wonder of the earth, but
     the rental price is surely the ninth wonder.

     would be Pegasus, from what we note here.

CC: Okay. Fine.

[02:00:59:06]
CC: Next time you bleed down your primary oxygen pressure,
     bring it all the way down to about 800 psi.
     We can't find much else that we can do about the
     thing. Just bring it down lower so you are working
     through a wider band. We don't think that is going
     to cause you to use any.

[02:00:59:28]
C: Roger. Bring it down. Listen, I just then ran the
     thing up to about 5 1/4, and I'm trying to hold it
     at 5 1/4 with the Repress ... hold it. If not,
     I'll bring it down to around 800.

[02:00:59:40]
CC: Okay. We think you can go way down in your pressure
     now without hurting anything, so if it gets to be a
     nuisance just bring it on down so that you don't have
     to watch it so close and be bothered with it too much.

[02:01:00:50]
CC: Roger. Could you give us an estimate as to how far
     that satellite was from you yesterday?

[02:01:00:57]
C: I couldn't really tell. It looked like quite a
     large object, and it looked like I was closing on
     it rather rapidly. Distance is rather hard to
     judge. I'd say 10 miles or so.

[02:01:01:10]
CC: 10 miles?

[02:01:01:11]
C: That's just a guess. I really can't tell. I was
     close enough where I could see -

[02:01:01:19]

     that close to you. Pegasus was about 1200 miles
     away.

[02:01:01:57]
CC: Pretty good eyeballs, all right.

C: Okay. Very good. All Type 2's to Type 1.

[02:02:37:13]
CC: Okay, and how much has Ed been sleeping the last
     couple of hours? Can you give us a clue on that?

[02:02:37:20]
C: Roger. Ed's only had about an hour nap. We're
     going to have to rearrange our sleep cycle a little
     bit, too.

[02:02:37:26]
C: Okay. Have you felt rested with the amount of sleep
     you've got, or do you think you'll need some more?

[02:02:37:34]
C: No, I don't think we're getting an awful lot of rest
     out of it, but on the other hand, we're not doing
     much so we're really not too tired. I think we'll
     go through this next pass, and Ed'll go back to
     sleep again.

[02:02:37:47]

CC: Okay. The other thing is, when you were doing your
     maneuvering during the first orbit, did you get
     that recorded on your onboard tape?

[02:02:37:58]
C: You mean on my voice onboard tape?

[02:02:38:00]
CC: Yes.

[02:02:38:02]
C: Say again.

[02:02:38:03]
CC: Yes. Did you get any of that - did you get it recorded
     on your onboard tape?

[02:02:38:09]
C: Roger. We got a good bit of it.

[02:02:38:11]
CC: Okay. Good.

[02:02:38:17]
CC: Hey, we'd like you to bring your Primary O<sub>2<sub> pressure
     down to 800. It's up to - we're reading it at 960.

[02:02:38:23]
C: Okay. I've got 950. We'll bring it on down.

[02:02:38:25]
CC: Okay.

[02:02:38:32]
C: Gus, on this - what's on the Voice Tape Recorder -
     they say we were turning it on and off. So we don't
     have it all.

[02:02:38:40]
CC: Say again.

[02:02:38:46]
CC: Say again, Jim.

[02:02:38:49]
C: Say again, Houston.

[02:02:38:51]
CC: Say again.

[02:02:38:54]
CC: Hey, Jim. This is Gus again. Do you read Houston
     still?

[02:02:39:00]
C: I'm not reading you.

[02:02:39:02]
CC: Hey, do you want to talk to your wives next pass?

[02:02:39:06]
C: Sure.

[02:02:39:08]
CC: Okay. If you want them, we'll put them on.

[02:02:39:37]
C: Okay, on that last pass we took about 38 pictures
     on the Synoptic Terrain Photography, starting a
     little bit east of San Diego and until we ran into
     the cloud coverage again. We picked up with intermittent
     pictures as soon as we started over the
     southern part of the United States down around
     Alabama and Mississippi and on across to Florida.
     We got some very good pictures of the weather in
     that area, then we got some pictures of the air
     fields around Jacksonville. We took a couple of
     pictures of the Cape. Probably one of the best
     pictures we got was one shooting back, and we got
     the whole weather formation along the coastline
     starting with Florida and going all the way back to
     Texas. A very well defined line of weather following
     closely to the coastline. Then we took some
     pictures of the weather formation in the State of
     Florida, around Cuba and the island area, and into
     the gulf ... weather build-ups, clouds, and we
     took a couple of pictures of the island, some very
     good pictures. We ended up taking up 55 pictures.

     like a star on the ground when you see one go by.
     A long, long ways away. When I saw this satellite
     go by, we were pointed just about directly overhead.
     It looked like it was going from left to the right.
     ... back towards the west, so it must have been
     going from south to north.

[02:03:16:20]
P: The fix on the vent valve and the ECS O<sub>2<sub> was very
     cleverly fixed to take care of John's complaint that
     it vented out of scale. Now, of course, it vents
     down into the scale and causes quite a bit of problem,
     as everyone knows, with the oxygen. The problem
     still lies in getting the ... in here ...

     some kind of a spare moment to try and describe on
     your onboard voice tape recorder everything you
     remember that happened on your first rev.

[02:03:25:30]

     ago. About half-way around on the night side the
     hatch temperature was 67°, and stand by and I'll
     give those others.

     does. You can't see it now, but the horizon changes
     between sunset and sunrise. Quite a bit.

[02:04:29:43]
P: Okay.

[02:04:29:57]

     got the star, and I got the blue filter on. It cut
     everything out except my star, pretty well. But I
     haven't got down to the horizon yet.

[02:04:30:26]
P: This thing, I think, could do with an eye stabilization.

[02:04:30:29]

     in my window.

     gone.

[02:04:31:36]

[02:04:31:53]
P: The green filter I have cut out most of the airglow.

[02:04:31:57]
P: It leaves me a little tiny band. And it's pretty
     hard to measure from.

[02:04:32:07]
C: Why don't you get that band and see what kind of
     angles you get?

[02:04:32:09]
P: Well, I want to try. I don't think I ought to use
     that filter.

[02:04:32:12]

[02:04:33:48]
C: The star went out the top. I couldn't hold it anymore.

[02:04:33:50]
C: Okay, you want me to do the next one then?

[02:04:33:53]
P: No, let me try one more hack at it.

[02:04:33:57]
C: That will hold, maybe ... a little better.

[02:04:34:02]
P: We found out that the filters aren't too good.

[02:04:34:05]
C: Yes, I planned on playing a lot around with the
     filters, just themselves when you were sleeping.
     The next thing I was going to do, I was just going
     to get the sextant out and play with the filters
     and stuff.

_page : 252
S: Gemini 4, Surgeon, CSQ Surgeon. Would you repeat
     your eating?

[02:05:21:21]
P: I'd like to comment a little on the sextant. Its
     use in a cramped spacecraft is very difficult,
     particularly with the helmet on. I finally decided
     it was going to be useless with your helmet on to
     try to take the angles that the stars, that were
     being called for, required. So I took my helmet
     off. This gave me a little more flexibility in
     using it, but still I was limited to angles of about
     20 to 23° without maneuvering the spacecraft. What
     would happen is the star would be cut out by the
     upper part of the window. Now, by more frequent
     and liberal maneuvering of the spacecraft you could
     maneuver it so that you have the long axis of the
     window in your tracking plane. We were somewhat
     limited by fuel and we didn't choose to maneuver in
     this manner. We used Pulse Mode, too, without a
     lot of maneuvers. The stars that were selected for
     that run were ones that had rather high angles so
     the horizon and, therefore, were very difficult to
     get. We finally decided to go ahead and get the
     stars a little closer to the horizon. I ran a
     couple on Canopus and a couple of others, as you'll
     notice. The blue filter seemed to block out the
     horizon totally; I didn't have any horizon when I
     used that. Our horizon image probably is not as
     good when there is moonlight. The green filter,
     though, gave me what I would consider a little
     clearer horizon than I had with no filter at all.
     I felt there was not a difficulty in making these
     measurements with either the green or clear filter.
     Still, the horizon is not very well defined and you
     have to kind of standardize yourself and measure on
     the same part of the horizon that you did before to
     get some type of a standard measurement. To me it
     was easier to measure with no filter to the top of
     the airglow. With the green filter I liked to
     measure the bottom of the airglow.

     what the position of your RCS heater switch is, and
     the status of the indicator lights.

[02:16:41:01]
P: Roger. I've been having a cycling on and off of the
     requirements of the RCS heater. The first one was
     at 06:47, and I put the heater on and the light was
     extinguished at 06:54. That was ring A. Ring B
     came on at 06 - 07:05. It took 5 minutes to
     extinguish it. Ring B came on at 07:20, and it also
     took 5 minutes to extinguish it. Ring B came on at

[02:18:41:01]
P: Negative, they are not.

[02:18:41:02]

[02:18:41:11]
C: Canary, Gemini 4.

[02:18:41:14]
CC: Go ahead.

[02:18:41:16]
CC: Gemini 4, Canary. Go ahead.

[02:18:41:18]
P: All right. 08:23 to 08:33 and 08:14 to 08:20.

[02:18:41:25]
CC: Say again the last.

[02:18:41:26]
P: 08:14 to 08:20.

CC: Roger. Copy on 08:23 to 08:33 and 08:14 to 08:20.

[02:18:49:49]
P: I've taken a picture, a very good picture, of the
     Cairo airport from the track over the station.

[02:18:49:56]
C: I think that on this tracking task, using the world
     map and the small map of the Cairo-Alexandria area,
     we were able to pick up the airport at Cairo. However,
     I didn't see the airport until we were about
     10° from it, I would guess, or 15°. Is that when
     you saw it?

[02:18:50:25]
P: Yeah.

[02:18:50:28]
C: Okay, so that makes -

P: That next time.

C: Okay, that happened last time -

P: In Texas.

[02:18:50:30]
_page : 276
C: Yeah. Now that we know where (illegible) will be a lot easier the next time around. The first time we looked for Cairo - for Cairo and Alexandria, we found that (illegible) a while. I never did really see the airfield. I just saw the area. I guessed if I pointed the camera right, I'd have a picture of Cairo. But this time I actually picked up the airfield. Same thing with
     Alexandria. I think if you are going to take a
     picture of something like that, it might be worthwhile
     to pass over it one time, take a good look at
     it and take the pictures next time around.

[02:19:11:18]
C: Hello Carnarvon, Gemini 4.

[02:19:11:21]
CC: Roger. You're looking good here on the ground.
     How are you up there?

[02:19:11:22]
C: Everything is fine.

[02:19:11:25]
CC: Okay, I've got a little info for you. Got a pencil
     and paper?

[02:19:11:27]
C: Stand by just a second.

[02:19:11:43]
C: Okay. Go ahead.

[02:19:11:44]
CC: They would like for you to power up and aline your
     platform at 10 50 00. They would also like for you
     to turn on Experiment MSC-1 at that time.

[02:19:12:05]
C: Okay, MSC-1 ON at 10:50 and I'm to power up and
     aline the platform at that time.

[02:19:12:11]
CC: Roger. And you're to go ahead with your MSC-10.
     That's MSC-10 if it doesn't interfere with platform
     alinement.

[02:19:12:18]
C: Okay, we're supposed to do MSC-10 at that time.

[02:19:12:30]
_page : 277
C: Carnarvan, I'm not reading you. Was I supposed to do MSC no. 1 and
     MSC no. 10, or just MSC-10?

[02:19:12:45]
CC: MSC-1 will go ON at that time, and you're to do
     MSC-10 if it doesn't interfere.

[02:19:12:51]
C: Roger, okay. We'll do that.

[02:19:12:55]
CC: Okay. I don't have a new update time. Use the
     original times on the Flight Plan for MSC-10.

[02:19:12:58]
C: Say again.

[02:19:12:59]
CC: Use your Flight Plan times for MSC-10. No new
     update.

[02:19:13:04]
C: Roger.

[02:19:13:05]
CC: Okay.

[02:19:13:06]
C: Okay.

[02:19:13:09]
CC: Is your buddy asleep?

[02:19:13:11]
C: Yes, he's starting to doze off. I am going to have
     to wake him up before we can do MSC-10 together.

[02:19:13:15]
CC: Okay. Stand by. Let me make sure they want to do
     that.

[02:19:13:36]
CC: Okay, they want you to wake him up to help you with
     MSC-1 when you need to.

[02:19:13:39]
C: Roger. I will.

[02:19:13:41]
CC: Roger.

[02:19:15:07]
CC: They will give you a Flight Plan update over the
     States.

[02:19:15:16]
C: Roger. Understand we will get a Flight plan update
     over the States. It looks like we're going to be
     pretty busy up there at that time. We'll be alining
     the platform and doing MSC-10 at the same time.

[02:19:15:24]
CC: Okay, I'll tell them not to bother you too much.

[02:19:15:54]
CC: Okay, we've got to turn your platform ON.

[02:19:15:58]
C: Say again.

[02:19:16:00]
CC: You turned your platform ON, didn't you?

[02:19:16:04]
C: I put my ACME ... I'm just going to straighten
     the spacecraft up and get it turned right-side-up
     here.

[02:19:16:07]
CC: Okay, very good.

[02:19:16:15]
_page : 278
C: We just started up the platform, it will take it
     about 30 minutes to come up before we can start
     alining it.

[02:19:16:20]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[02:19:16:22]
C: Okay.

[02:19:16:24]
C: We're going to start the power at 10:50.

[02:19:16:25]
CC: Very good.

[02:19:27:13]
C: Gemini 4, again. I see the same sort of curve of
     lights, like the northern lights except they are
     below us, and I saw them another time, they were
     great big long lines. Looks like they run about
     parallel to the direction of our flight path and
     they extend from just below the airglow in the
     earth's horizon, up a little bit past the top of
     the airglow. The same thing I saw the other night
     except that it's not quite as bright as it was then.

[02:19:27:44]
P: It reinforced the airglow.

[02:19:27:47]
C: That's right. It looks like it reinforced the air
     glow.

[02:19:27:50]
P: Reinforced the air glow more down to the bottom.

[02:19:34:06]
C: Got IGS power on the line and platform to CAGE SEF
     at Houston.

[02:19:35:35]
P: The ... thruster went on at 10:52. 10:51.

[02:19:35:42]
P: MARK!

[02:19:40:52]
P: I just saw a falling star trail down not too far in
     front of us and it burned out considerably below us.
     The whole tail -- was quite long, which was actually
     below our level. It burned up considerably below
     us.

[02:19:41:10]
C: Yes.

[02:19:48:35]
C: We are starting the MSC Experiment at 11:04.

[02:19:48:49]
P: If we had an event timer track Experiment at 11:04.

[02:19:48:54]
C: Don't think we can.

[02:19:48:56]
P: Get it at Carnarvon. We can't get out and fire them
     normally ... Glad we got it at the right time
     anyway.

[02:19:49:03]
C: Yeah.

[02:19:49:19]
_page : 279
C: Okay. Now it looks like - Okay, the weather on the
     horizon -- clouds, clouds on the horizon on the left
     hand side of the picture, I can see the clouds right
     up to about the middle, and at the middle it looks
     like they break off, and then there's just some
     scattered high stuff - it looks like this stuff on
     the left is pretty solid.

[02:19:49:54]
P: Been going on 2 minutes.

[02:19:49:59]
C: I've got one ...

[02:19:50:02]
P: ...

[02:19:50:08]
C: Are 2 minutes up? What time do you have?

[02:19:50:11]
P: Right now I have 12:30.

[02:19:50:14]
C: 12:30?

[02:19:50:16]
P: Yes.

[02:19:50:21]
C: 38, 39, 40.

[02:19:50:32]
C: Look at that star rising up there -- see it? Or is
     that another one of our satellites?

[02:19:50:37]
P: Where?

[02:19:50:39]
C: See it right in front of us, that bright star ...

P: No.

[02:19:51:01]
P: That looks almost like a normal sunrise, doesn't it?

[02:19:51:03]
C: That's what it is.

[02:19:51:06]
P: Well, you know, that's not what you expected it to
     be. I -- I don't have the lens on right.

[02:19:51:25]
P: It's coming up on 4 minutes now.

[02:19:51:29]
C: I've got 3:40. Lens is on right.

[02:19:51:41]
P: Well, it sort of slipped down.

[02:19:51:44]
C: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

[02:19:51:51]
P: That would have been something, wouldn't it?

[02:19:51:56]
C: Yes.

[02:19:51:58]
P: Let's do this one more time.

[02:19:52:25]
P: I'll go ahead and get this off -- What the heck?

C: Wish we had some lights in here.

[02:19:52:33]
P: Well, that's what they want, don't they? Carry it
     out like he said. I remember he said ...

[02:19:52:37]

C: 753 at 09 - 11:09 - Sun right on the horizon. We
     haven't had much success with the photo-event indicator
     on the Hasselblad. We have it. Puts the

     have not started caging.

[02:20:11:11]
CC: Roger. Understand. Houston advises to take it easy
     on your fuel. They estimate 10 lbs of propellant
     for these checks.

[02:20:11:23]
C: Roger, I'll go easy on it. We've been in Pulse Mode
     ever since we took off.

     on sunset?

[02:20:43:26]
C: Negative, I'm not.

[02:20:43:28]
CC: Okay. I'd like you to take a look to see if you
     can see the lights of Melbourne. That'll be about
     8 minutes from now.

[02:20:43:35]
C: Okay. At 00:08?

[02:20:43:41]
CC: Ought to be a pretty good time. They should be just
     a little to the right of you -- just about underneath
     you -- just slightly down.

     here real bad. I don't know whether the weather is
     clear over Melbourne or not.

C: ... I turned it on at 11:50 and at 12:15 I got
     the Attitude Mal Light which indicated that it was
     warmed up.

[02:20:46:11]
CC: Okay. 25 minutes. Thank you.

[02:20:46:13]
C: Roger. I didn't start alining until about 30 after.

[02:20:46:23]
C: And after I started alining it, I started with a
     pretty bad reference, because we were trying to get
     this MSC-10 thing done. It took about 15 to 17 minutes
     to get it to aline properly.

[02:20:46:35]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[02:20:47:01]
CC: Looks like your cohort woke up?

[02:20:47:03]

     ... He only got better for about 15 minutes.

[02:20:47:11]
CC: Wasn't worth it.

     southeast of the tip of Florida. Probably about
     over Cuba.

[02:21:31:49]
C: I got it. I thought it was an island - turned out
     it was Florida.

[02:21:32:00]
CC: Gemini 4, can you give us a reading on OAMS source
     pressure, temperature, and quantity?.

[02:21:32:08]
C: Roger. The quantity reads 55 percent, but it keeps
     going up and down. I think that's a pretty good
     average number right now.

[02:21:32:21]
P: The OAMS source temperature is 70, pressure is 1900.

[02:21:32:30]

     a first guess -- OAMS.

[02:21:34:08]
C: I've used how much?

[02:21:34:20]

C: No, we haven't used that much at all.

[02:21:35:13]
CC: Gemini, this is Houston. That's just a rough guess
     on the OAMS usage. We'll get a better cut at it
     after Canaries. You're still looking good.

[02:23:52:50]
CC: Negative. 15 44 55.

[02:23:52:58]
C: Okay, 15 44 55. My T/M switch to REAL TIME and
     ACQUISITION.

[02:23:53:03]
CC: Right. Three minutes prior to that they want you to
     put your oral temp probe in your mouth. They want
     a Type 1 Medical Pass over Guaymas.

[02:23:53:12]
C: Okay. Type 1 over Guaymas.

[02:23:53:14]
CC: Okay.

[02:23:53:16]
C: They told me they wanted me right-side-up when I
     went over you. Was that next time or this time?

[02:23:53:21]
CC: It must have been for the next time. Hold on. I'll
     see what they are talking about.

[03:00:30:52]
C: Roger. Do you read?

[03:00:30:54]
S: Roger, Gemini 4. Start your exercise on your mark.
     We have received your blood pressure.

C: Roger. I just finished up Meal A of Day 3. Ed has
     finished one -- the same type, too.

[03:00:32:40]
S: Say again, Gemini.

[03:00:32:41]
C: I had a lot of water. I don't know how many gulps,
     but I probably had 20 to 30 gulps along with a
     couple of meals in the last 2 hours.

[03:00:32:48]
S: Roger, understand meal Charlie.

[03:00:32:52]

CC: I've got quite a bit of information to pass up to
     you, Jim. First of all - first is your 48-1 time.
     Tell me as soon as you are ready to copy.

[03:00:35:50]
C: Okay. Go ahead.

[03:00:35:51]
CC: Okay. 24 ft/sec forward, that's 40 seconds,
     120 ft/sec aft, that's 2+32 at 17 20 00. 2+53.
     8+55. Continue 48-1 time without burn. 17 14 37.
     7+41. 14+29.

[03:00:36:33]
C: Got it.

[03:00:36:34]
CC: Okay. Now I've got quite a bit of information to
     pass up to you here. We would like for the Pilot,
     who is asleep, to leave his face-plate open and his
     gloves off. And then we would like for the Pilot
     that is awake to take off his helmet and gloves and
     use the light-weight headset for communications if
     he can. And we would like for you to continue this
     way up until about 3 hours prior to retrofire. Then,
     once in orbit, at your convenience, we would like
     for you to take a wet and dry bulb reading and just
     at any station give us a report of what it was and
     what time you took it.

[03:00:37:24]
C: Okay. We have been operating with the face-plate
     open and gloves off now for about the last 12 hours,
     but mostly in that situation we kept oversleeping.
     When we sleep we generally close the visor and put
     the ... cover to keep the light out of our eyes.

[03:00:37:44]
_page : 297
CC: Roger.

[03:00:37:47]
C: The humidity stays down around 50 percent.

[03:00:37:52]
CC: Roger. Okay, Jim, we decided that you've got a little
     bit of fuel left that we can play with here in the
     Flight Plan. We would like for you to go to the
     Horizon Scan Mode for the next 8 hours. That's at
     an elapsed time of about 80:30, and we want you to
     use the Primary Scanner. We don't want you to do
     any controlling in yaw, and if the scanner breaks
     lock, don't control in roll or pitch either. We
     want to see - if it breaks lock, we would like to
     see if it will reacquire.

[03:00:38:33]
C: Okay. You want the horizon scanners on for the next
     8 hours.

[03:00:38:36]
CC: Affirmative.

[03:00:38:38]
C: 80 hours elapsed time.

[03:00:38:39]
CC: Roger.

[03:00:38:41]
C: Okay, Gus. For flight planning purposes, we haven't
     been able to do much with D-9, because we haven't
     been using the fuel for it. We ought to save a
     little fuel to do that.

[03:00:38:51]
CC: Okay. We got no problem. Go ahead and use your
     D-9. Now, on the Apollo Landmark no. 2, we would
     like for you to be in attitude for that at 17:19.
     G.m.t. of 17:19. And the landmark will be 16 miles
     north of track, and you should be pitched down about
     minus 30° at that time. And we would like for you
     to track this as close as possible and to get some
     pictures using the 16-mm camera with 75-mm lenses
     with a nominal lens setting.

[03:00:39:32]
C: Roger. Will do.

[03:00:39:34]
CC: Do you want me to repeat any of that?

[03:00:39:36]
C: Negative. Apollo no. 2 at 17:19. 16 miles north
     of track. Pitch is down about 30° and use the 75-mm
     lenses at that time.

[03:00:39:45]
CC: Roger, and really have at it and track it close.
     Use your reticle.

[03:00:39:48]
C: Okay.

[03:00:39:50]
_page : 298
CC: Okay. Your Orbit Nav Runs 9 and 10 do as scheduled
     in the Flight Plan. Do it just as you previously
     planned to do it. Just for information, 9 is scheduled
     at an elapsed time of 75:30 and 10 at 75:50.

[03:00:40:13]
C: Okay. We will do Orbit Nav Runs 9 and 10 as scheduled
     at 75:30 and 75:50.

[03:00:40:18]
CC: Roger. We are going to come up with some more
     tracking tasks for you, I think, and we want most
     of them to be done pretty tight.

[03:00:40:27]
C: Okay. Very good.

[03:00:40:29]
CC: Okay, I have a map update for you if you want it now.

[03:00:40:33]
C: Okay. Go ahead.

[03:00:40:35]
CC: Okay. 170° East, G.m.t. is 17 00 00. That's Rev 47.

[03:00:40:48]
C: Okay. 17 East at 17 00 00. Rev 47.

[03:00:40:56]
CC: Roger. You can bring your Quantity Read OFF.

[03:00:41:03]
_extra : Section BERMUDA
CC: And you can bring your computer OFF also.

[03:00:41:22]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston. How do you read now?

C: Loud and clear.

[03:00:41:25]
CC: Okay. Did you get all of that? Did you get the
     Quantity Read OFF and the computer OFF?

[03:00:41:30]
C: Yes. I'm getting them now.

[03:00:41:32]
CC: Okay.

[03:00:41:35]
CC: Okay, now Flight would like to know if you are going
     to try sleeping with your helmet off. Try sleeping
     with your face-plate open, I'm sorry.

[03:00:41:49]
C: I don't know. The sun really gets in your eyes, Gus.
     I don't think we'll try that. Ed has tried sleeping
     with his helmet up and then down and right now he
     just slipped it up. He's having a tough time with
     the sun. I tried it, and I can't do it.

[03:00:42:05]
CC: Okay. Can you just put the shade over anyway?

[03:00:42:10]
C: Yes. He's sleeping with it about half open. How
     about that?

[03:00:42:13]
CC: Okay.

[03:00:42:17]
_page : 299
C: Actually the last 12 hours or more, maybe as much
     as 24, we haven't been too careful about keeping
     our face-plate closed and our ... bands up because
     obviously, the humidity isn't going up.

[03:00:42:28]
CC: Yeah. Well, of course, that is what we are trying
     to do. We are trying to get a good hack on what is
     happening there. Maybe we don't have a problem like
     we originally thought.

[03:00:42:37]
C: Yes. I don't think we do. Essentially, Ed hasn't
     had his face-plate closed for the last 12 hours,
     and I only had mine closed when I was sleeping.

[03:00:42:44]
CC: Okay. Well, go ahead and do what we asked as near
     as you can and give us those wet and dry bulbs so
     we can get a good spot on this thing.

[03:00:42:54]
C: Okay. I have been running them right along and our
     temperatures are running about -- the dry bulbs are
     running 72 and 75, the wet bulbs between 60 and 64.
     The relative humidity stands pretty close to around
     60 percent.

[03:00:43:08]
CC: Very good.

[03:00:43:10]
C: Yes. And there is no visible moisture. And there
     isn't any moisture around that blotting paper. Unfortunately,
     you covered up the walls so that I
     can't take the temperature, but the worst temperature
     I can find is about 65.

[03:00:43:24]
CC: Roger.

[03:00:43:36]
CC: Jim, the Flight Surgeon wonders if he can say anything
     about your eyes. Have you had any problems?
     Any drying or anything at all?

[03:00:43:45]
C: Yes. Listen, I had a lot of trouble with my eyes
     at the end of the first day. I wasn't sure I was
     going to be able to hack it. But they have cleared
     up now. I think our little problem was taken care
     of by the suit heat exchanger.

[03:00:43:58]
CC: Okay. You don't have any problem at all now with
     them?

[03:00:44:01]
C: No problem at all. Though it was really bad between
     about 18 and 36 hours.

[03:00:44:09]
CC: Roger, understand. Anything else?

[03:00:44:13]
C: No. We are pretty well.

[03:01:26:05]

C: There sure have been some wild thunder clouds over
     Australia here in the last couple of days.

[03:01:26:22]
CC: That's affirmative. We've had about 3 inches of
     rain today. People around here can really use it
     for their sheep. This is the dry time of the year.

[03:02:10:49]
C: Roger, I just got it ON about a couple of seconds
     ago.

[03:02:10:50]
CC: Okay, fine. Hey, Jim, we've decided not to do an
     orbit adjust. So you just make one burn prior to
     retrofire.

[03:02:11:00]
C: Okay. How big is it going to be?

[03:02:11:02]
CC: It'll be about 130 ft/sec.

[03:02:11:04]
C: Okay. What's my orbit right now?

[03:02:11:09]
CC: Say again.

[03:02:11:10]
C: What's my current orbit?

[03:02:11:12]
CC: Stand by, I'll get it for you. This means that we
     have some extra fuel to play with. So we're in the
     process now of working in some other tracking tasks,
     and some other things into your Flight Plan that
     we'll be passing up to you as you go along.

[03:02:11:24]
C: Very good.

[03:02:11:27]
CC: So we're going to do a little bit more controlling.

[03:02:11:30]
CC: Your orbit right now is 86.3 by 141.6 Staying up
     very, very well.

     orbit?

[03:02:11:46]
C: I don't know if Ed did one or not; I'll do one.
     Do you want it right now?

CC: Well, can you do it? We can wait a little while until
     Ed wakes up if you want.

[03:02:11:55]
C: No, he's going to be asleep for awhile. I'll try to
     do it.

[03:02:12:13]
C: All right, I'll do it while I'm crossing the ocean.

C: Okay.

[03:02:12:28]
CC: Okay. Here's Haney's news release. It says in the
     morning paper that you're not going to go for 5 days.
     This came up in a press conference last night and
     in answer to this question Chris said it looked like
     we had the consumables to make it, but we had no
     plans to do so.

[03:02:12:52]
C: Roger.

[03:02:12:55]

     Pope John XXIII a saint. Even though it may take
     a hundred years or so.

[03:02:13:03]
C: Roger.

[03:02:13:05]

     going on. Then, there's a nice story about Chris
     and the Control Center and your flight team and
     your families in the Chronicle this morning.

[03:02:13:22]
C: Very good.

[03:02:13:25]
CC: And then, the last item, the Cards finally beat the
     Astros yesterday, 4-3. Took them 12 innings to do
     it. That's about it.

CC: This concerns the Zodiacal Light Experiment which
     is going to be on "5", and they want to find out if
     they're going to get any fogging of the film from
     the attitude control thrusters. We'd like for you
     to use your 35-mm Contarex camera, and you can use
     either black and white film or color. And set it
     wide open at f/18 with the range set at 8 feet.

[03:03:43:43]

[03:03:43:45]
CC: Then we'd like for you to put the camera against the
     window so that the -- and hold it so that the nose
     isn't in the field of view. Then we'd like two
     sets of photographs. Want you to be in Pulse Mode
     and have the spacecraft pointed straight down at
     the earth. This will be -- I'll give you the time
     to start it. But it will be at the black earth on
     the night side. And then give one pulse-up pitch -
     pitch pulse-up and get a picture with the shutters
     of the camera open in the bulb position. And then
     as you come up through the horizon, get another
     picture of -- with pitch-down pulse with another
     frame of the camera and again with the shutter wide
     open at that time. And then we want the same type
     of picture with pulse-up with the horizon view and
     with the black earth in view and a picture with
     pulse-down with the horizon view and the black earth
     in view.

[03:03:45:05]
C: Roger. Understand a pulse-up and pulse-down with
     the bulb position on the 35-mm black and white or

P: MARK!

[03:09:41:51]
S: Gemini 4, Hawaii Surgeon. Be advised we had telemetry
     dropout, and may have missed your second blood
     pressure. Have you transmitted yet?

[03:09:42:01]
P: Roger, I have transmitted.

[03:09:42:03]

     update concerning the fuel consumed when we had LOS.
     Do you have that message for me?

[03:10:02:40]

P: Roger.

[03:10:04:22]
CC: Will you bring it on down to about 850?

[03:10:04:31]
P: I'd rather not right now. The Command Pilot is
     sleeping, and we don't have him suited up in glove
     and helmet.

[03:10:04:51]
CC: Roger. We concur.

     a run on Antares and the third order magnitude star
     in Scorpio. We made no Apollo star to booster sightings.
     We have made three Air Force D-9 runs.
     Houston, Gemini 4. Are you reading?

CC: Roger, I copied those.

[03:12:48:58]
C: And the Air Force D-9 run -- the way they're laid
     out is difficult to run. We got some runs though,
     in different order and accomplished basically the
     information that they wanted in D-9.

[03:12:49:12]

     and when I went back up I didn't have any luck.
     The sun was just about 90° also. And there's a
     lot of stuff on the outside of my window which makes
     a lot of reflection. Very difficult to see.

     case 70 nautical miles. That's 70. What we would
     like to have you do is an OAMS retro maneuver; then
     we will have a manual retrofire, of course, with no
     computer. We want a zero-lift, rolling reentry.
     That's zero-lift, rolling reentry. The reason for
     the decision on the rolling versus a 90-90 bank is
     that there's less chance of dispersions. They will
     tend to equalize out. We feel we can have a faster
     recovery that way. Also, doing it that way we can
     get an IP prior to your blackout and you should pull
     about 8g's on that reentry. Do you copy?

[03:13:36:43]
C: Roger. Understand a maximum 3-sigma miss distance
     of 70 nautical miles, an OAMS retro, a manual retrofire,
     a zero-lift rolling, I got a faster recovery,
     be able to plot point of impact.

[03:13:37:10]
CC: Roger. You got all of that. Now this zero-lift
     rolling only applies to your terminal maneuvers.
     All your CLA's and PLA's onboard are still the 60°
     bank.

[03:13:37:22]
C: Roger, understand.

[03:13:37:25]
CC: Okay. I have a D-9 update for you. It's a Run
     no. 1, Revolution 55 and 56. Start time 05 48 45,
     use stars of opportunity.

[03:13:37:50]
C: Roger. Rev 55, and no. 1, start time 05 48 55 and
     say the last part.

[03:13:37:57]
CC: That start time is 05 48 45, use stars of opportunity.

[03:13:38:04]
C: Stars of opportunity?

[03:13:38:17]
CC: Gemini 4, I did not get your last transmission. I
     say again, use stars of opportunity.

[03:13:38:24]
C: Roger, stars of opportunity.

[03:13:38:26]
CC: Okay, do you have any questions you would like the
     ground to answer with regards to your reentry?

[03:13:38:48]
_page : 335
CC: Gemini 4, this is Houston. We passed up this reentry
     so you two could talk it over and come back
     later on if you have any questions. For your information,
     the 63-1 weather forecast looks like
     about 3- to 4-foot waves with 18 knots of wind,
     visibility and ceiling will be good.

[03:13:39:10]
C: Roger, understand. Was that an Apollo 9 or D-9 for
     that Rev 55?

[03:13:39:17]
CC: That is a D-9 Run no. 1. Stand by and I'll get
     further clarification.

[03:13:39:34]
CC: Gemini 4, this is Houston. That is not Apollo, it's
     just straight D-9.

[03:13:39:39]

C: Go ahead.

[03:16:18:14]
CC: Okay. We want to check the computer in all modes.
     There will be three steps to this check. First
     step: put 10 ft/sec in all IVI windows. Then push
     the Malfunction Reset. Then press the Start Comp
     and watch for a Computer Running Light indication.
     You will do this in all modes. If you do not - I
     repeat - do not get an indication of computer running,
     then you will perform another test. In this other
     test, you will check in all modes. You will turn
     the computer OFF for 2 seconds - the Computer power
     OFF for 2 seconds. After the computer has been repowered,
     repress the manual Malfunction Reset and
     also Start Comp. If you get a Computer Running
     Light in any mode, discontinue this 2-second power
     off. Do you copy?

C: Roger. Computer check of all modes. Insert
     10 ft/sec in all the IVI's, push the Malfunction
     Light, and push the Start Comp button. ... is
     ... turn the computer OFF for 2 seconds, repower
     and depress the Malfunction Light. If we get those
     ... at any time, well, we should discontinue the
     test.

[03:16:19:55]
CC: Roger. That's affirmative. We're standing by here
     for you to start it. If you can't finish it over
     our site, go ahead and report the results to the
     Canary Islands.

[03:16:20:02]
C: Okay. We've done these things already without any
     results, but I'll go ahead and go over them again.

[03:16:20:08]
CC: Okay.

C: That doesn't do anything.

[03:16:23:09]
CC: That's the way they want you to do it. They want to
     see if there's any change in the IVI windows as you
     run through the test.

[03:16:40:34]
CC: I think everybody else is thinking the same thing.

[03:16:57:24]
C: I just made a run on Target 16-A. The air field at
     Basra, it's right at the Persian Gulf. I picked it
     up -- I picked the Persian Gulf up about ... an
     angle of about 30° ... I pitched down then
     picked up the lake. ... northwest of the Persian
     Gulf. Basra being right on the lakes, very near
     the lakes, you can just follow over and pick up the
     airfield right away. So I got the airfield out quite
     a ways before I got to the target, and then just
     started tracking on the target. I was actually on
     the target by the time I was still 20° from the
     vertical, I would guess - and tracked it on out from
     the runway to about the 40° point past it, and I
     stopped tracking. I had this 75-mm lens on the
     16-mm camera with the adapter on it to take pictures
     out the forward end and I had it running from the
     last experiment ... for the target -

[03:17:21:55]
C: Well, we saw Australia for the first time in the
     daylight. First passed up Basra then across the
     islands of India. On across India to Malaysia and
     on across to Australia ... we certainly -- only
     passed about half so far.

[03:17:22:12]
C: I've seen an awful lot of North Africa ... daylight
     -- know quite well. I've just completed D-9
     Apollo Landmark run on Target 14. I had a very
     good pickup. I had seen the target before; I knew
     where it was. I got right on the thing about 30°
     below the horizon and got on the area, and picked
     up the specific target at about 20°, 30° from the
     vertical. Got on the target at about 30° from the
     vertical and then tracked it to the vertical and
     then back off ... back up, straight on, and then
     back up.

P: ... picture.

[03:18:02:16]
C: Okay, it'll be Sequence no. 14 at 09 40 22 minus 6,
     and minus 30.

[03:18:02:23]
CC: Roger, and understand Ed will be asleep during this
     time. Is that correct?

[03:18:02:27]
C: That is correct.

[03:18:02:28]
CC: Okay. We want to just advise you to use all the
     film. This is your last experiment. Use all the
     film you have at your option. Jim's here and we'd
     like to discuss this reentry with you a little bit.
     One other thing, Jim, we have increased the lifetime
     of your aft thrusters to 131 ft/sec, and you will
     receive no split burn on OAMS retro.

[03:18:02:54]
C: Very good, very good. I was wondering what you were
     going to do about that.

[03:18:02:56]
CC: Yes, we've been holding on to that for a while and
     thought we'd surprise you. Here's Jim.

[03:18:03:01]
CC: Gemini 4, this is Shakey here.

[03:18:03:05]
C: Hello Shakey here, how are you?

[03:18:03:06]
CC: Fine. Listen, what are your feelings on a rolling
     reentry versus the 90° bank angle? We're recommending
     a rolling here.

[03:18:03:15]
C: Yes, it's not very imaginative, but it gets the job
     done. So why don't we go ahead with it?

[03:18:03:19]
_page : 341
CC: Roger. Here is the format which we'll send up to
     you for a rolling reentry. We'll give you the ∆V
     and ∆T for your OAMS burn. We'll give you the GMTRC.
     We'll give you a RET of .05g. And then you will
     also get the RET of drogue, of main, and of landing.
     Your procedure will be at retro to go to full lift,
     heads down. At the RET of .05g you will go into a
     15° roll rate. When you reach 100,000, when the
     altimeter comes off the peg, go to full lift. How
     does that sound to you, Jim?

[03:18:04:12]
C: Roger. I think I've blocked part of you out. Right
     after retrofire we go to full lift and at .05g, or
     at that time, we go to 15 deg/sec and at 100,000 we
     go to full lift again.

[03:18:04:25]
CC: That's right. The only difference between the format
     before is that instead of the RET of 400,000
     we'll give you .05g RET when you start your roll
     rate.

[03:18:04:37]
C: Okay, that sounds good.

[03:18:04:39]
CC: This will give you a trim angle into the atmosphere,
     a roll rate, and then full lift at 100,000 again for
     your drogue and main deploy.

[03:18:04:47]
C: Okay, very good.

[03:18:04:50]
CC: Shades of Mercury, Jim.

[03:18:04:53]
C: I was going to say I'll bet you Flight Directors
     were thinking of this one.

[03:18:04:58]
C: That's why I say not very imaginative, but I guess
     it gets the job done.

[03:18:05:03]
CC: Roger. I have a bet with your wife that you'll get
     within 5 miles. Now you've got to hold up my end
     here.

[03:18:05:11]
C: Okay. I'm going to try to hold up my end, too.
     Remember when I said we'd never make a closed
     looper?

[03:18:05:19]
CC: Doesn't look like we'll make one this time.

[03:18:05:21]
C: Yes.

[03:18:05:28]
CC: Hey, Jim, we're still going to pass you your updates
     for 60 through 64-4 with the bank angles in. Just
     the same as we've been passing them, with the exception
     of 63-1.

[03:18:05:40]

C: That's affirmative. Don't change those; we just
     want the final one.

[03:18:05:45]

     up and you'll get them at Canary.

CC: Hey, listen, are you feeling pretty tired now, or
     are you pretty good?

     think that Ed probably is, too.

[03:18:06:05]

     We're going to try to hold off the last couple orbits
     just to prepare for reentry.

     the general procedures for the reentry. You'll get
     the 63-1 update and the details on your next pass
     over the States from Gus. The general procedure
     we'd like you to follow is: after retrofire, roll
     to the normal position to a heads-down position,
     for full lift to 400 K. We will give you an altitude
     angle to hold down to 400 K, then we'd like you
     to roll at 15 deg/sec till the altimeter comes off
     the peg or approximately 100 K and then back to full
     lift again till drogue.

[03:22:36:47]
C: Roger, understand.

CC: Roger. The only change since we went over this the
     last time is that we're using 400 K instead of .05g.

[03:22:37:01]
C: Roger, understand.

[03:22:37:07]

     1745, something like that.

CC: Okay. You want your time to 50,000 to drogue deploy
     and to splash?

[04:00:10:09]
C: Roger.

[04:00:10:11]
CC: Okay. 10+55 to drogue deploy, and 17+10 to splash.

[04:00:10:19]
C: Roger. How about main chute?

[04:00:10:23]
CC: We don't have that one yet.

[04:00:10:25]
C: Roger. 10+55 to drogue, 17+55 to splash, and standing
     by for chute.

[04:00:10:36]
CC: In case you don't get your complete OAMS burn, advance
     your retrofire time by 2 seconds for each second
     that you're short of your OAMS burn.

[04:00:10:51]
C: Only 2 seconds?

[04:00:10:52]
CC: Roger. Two for one.

[04:00:10:55]
C: Okay. It used to be three for one. What happened?

[04:00:10:59]
_page : 354
CC: No, it never was, Jim.

[04:00:11:02]
C: It was about a week ago.

[04:00:11:06]
CC: This is a new week.

[04:00:11:11]
CC: Yes. Remember this is delta time now, not delta
     velocity.

[04:00:11:16]
C: Roger.

[04:00:11:18]
CC: On your checklist, when you pulled your drogue pins,
     did you pull your seat pins also?

[04:00:11:25]
C: Roger. We weren't there yet. We'll get them, though.

[04:00:11:34]
CC: Do you have everything stowed?

[04:00:11:36]
C: Yes. We've got everything stowed as well as we can
     stow it.

[04:00:11:38]
CC: Okay. The weather in your recovery area is scattered
     clouds, you've got 10 knots of wind and 4-foot waves.
     It couldn't be better.

[04:00:11:45]
C: Roger.

[04:00:11:47]
CC: Okay. The doctors want to talk to you here just a
     second.

C: Okay.

S: Jim? Both of you are in real good shape at the
     present time and all the EKG's look just fine. Your
     water intake has come up real well and from my last
     computation here, both of you appear to be really
     well hydrated for the reentry. I'd like to make sure
     that both of you feel completely rested. Is that
     affirmed?
		 
C: Oh, we're a little tired, but we're as rested as we
     can be.

[04:00:12:21]
S: All right, Jim. Do you feel that there's any need
     for item bravo?

[04:00:12:25]
C: Negative.

[04:00:12:28]
S: Negative. Okay. I'd like to review with you this
     blood pressure. You are not going to have the adapter
     on until after you're on the water. Ed already
     has it on, and we can tell from the data. He's to
     get one blood pressure after retro, one on the chute
     before bridle, one after bridle, and then both of
     you every 15 minutes in the water. Affirm?

[04:00:12:58]
_page : 355
S: Gemini 4, this is Houston Surgeon. Do you read?

[04:00:13:02]
C: I got that Surgeon. We remember what they are.

[04:00:13:28]
S: Gemini 4, this is Houston Surgeon.

[04:00:13:30]
C: Go ahead Houston Surgeon. I got your message there.

[04:00:13:33]
S: Roger. Okay. The other thing is the post-landing.
     We still - just to reaffirm - you would like no
     more than that 1 hour in the spacecraft. Get your suits
     off, at your discretion, if the spacecraft
     has no leak. The open hatch part is strictly your
     decision. It looks good in the recovery area at the
     present time for this. Remember the pumping exercise
     that we did at the time of the physical, and
     the feet up would be the preferable way. Are there
     any questions about this at all?

[04:00:14:10]
C: No questions.

[04:00:14:12]
S: Roger. We'll look forward to seeing you on the
     Carrier, then. Surgeon out.

[04:00:14:18]
C: Okay. When are you coming on, Chuck?

[04:00:14:20]
CC: This afternoon, Jim. Hope to be there shortly after
     you are.

[04:00:14:26]
C: Okay.

[04:00:14:37]
CC: Is there anything else we can do for you, or is there
     anything else that you want, Jim?

[04:00:14:41]
C: Yes, my computer.

[04:00:14:50]
CC: I wish I had an answer for that.

[04:00:15:05]
C: What did you say?

[04:00:15:07]
CC: You'd only have to compare it with my performance.

[04:00:15:13]
C: You're unbeatable, Chris. I just unplugged it.

[04:00:15:16]
CC: Roger.

[04:00:15:42]
CC: Hey, Jim?

[04:00:15:43]
C: Yes.

[04:00:15:47]
CC: John just wanted to remind you that the toughest
     part comes after you get back to the States.

[04:00:15:50]
C: I've been resting my arm.

[04:00:15:53]
CC: Better rest your voice, too.
     BERMUDA

[04:00:16:00]
_page : 356
C: Listen, I just won't shave. I'm so pretty now nobody
     will like me again.

[04:00:16:07]
CC: That doesn't bother. Just don't take a bath.

[04:00:16:17]
C: I thought those fumes before were bad!

[04:00:16:20]
CC: Say again.

[04:00:16:22]
C: I thought those fumes around 24 hours were bad!
     You ought to be up here now!

[04:00:16:27]
CC: Roger.

[04:00:16:30]
P: I'm going to run the tape continuous from now on.
     Let's put another one in here. I got one in there
     now and one later.

[04:00:16:35]
C: I'm not going ...

[04:00:16:38]
P: I'm all squared away over here.

[04:00:16:40]
C: Got your seat pin out?

[04:00:16:50]
C: I never put it in.

[04:00:16:52]
P: Okay, ...

[04:00:16:55]
CC: Jim. Could you give me your last cabin humidity
     reading that you took?

[04:00:16:59]
C: Roger. I took one about an hour ago. Just before
     I stowed the stuff, and I just took one right in
     the middle of the cabin, and it was 75 or 78 and
     62 wet. It hasn't gained appreciably since take-off.

[04:00:17:14]
C: Roger.

[04:00:17:16]
C: ... since take-off.

[04:00:17:17]
CC: Roger.

[04:00:17:18]
C: Okay, Ed babe, I'm going to start the -- heck, what
     did I do with my glove? Here they are, here.

[04:00:17:25]
C: I'm going to start suiting up.

[04:00:17:28]
P: Okay. You got an hour and twenty to go.

[04:00:17:35]
C: Hour and twenty?

[04:00:17:47]
CC: Jim?

[04:00:17:50]
C: Roger.

[04:00:17:51]
_page : 357
CC: We'll be losing you in about 2 minutes here. Hawaii
     will get your OAMS burn, and Guaymas will count you
     down to retrofire.

[04:00:17:54]
C: Okay.

[04:00:18:02]
P: Hey, let's pick up a good ...

[04:00:18:04]
CC: ...

[04:00:18:07]
CC: And as near as we can tell your IMU is in good shape
     down here.

[04:00:18:08]
C: Yes, it looks good up here, too.

[04:00:18:11]
P: Let's get a good Greenwich Mean Time update, too.

[04:00:18:13]
C: Gus, can you give us the Greenwich Mean Time?

[04:00:18:18]
CC: Say again?

[04:00:18:25]
CC: Give you G.m.t. at 15:35.

[04:00:18:28]
C: Roger.

[04:00:18:30]
CC: 30 seconds to go.

CC: Your TR is very good.

[04:00:18:33]
C: Roger.

[04:00:18:47]
CC: 20 seconds.

[04:00:18:49]
P: How many?

[04:00:18:50]
C: I don't know, a couple.

[04:00:18:53]
CC: 15:35 on my mark.

[04:00:18:55]
CC: MARK!

[04:00:18:56]
C: Roger. I'd like to know when it's 15 35 30.

[04:00:19:02]
CC: Roger.

[04:00:19:05]
C: 20 seconds.

[04:00:19:09]
C: Make that 32.

[04:00:19:11]
CC: Okay.

[04:00:19:22]
CC: 15 35 32, my mark.

[04:00:19:28]
CC: MARK!

[04:00:19:30]
C: Roger. thank you.

[04:00:19:50]
C: Ed, will you get this for me, please?

[04:00:19:52]
P: Yes sir ...

[04:00:19:54]
P: Do you want them tight?

[04:00:20:02]
_page : 358
C: Just like they are. No, they are all right now.

[04:00:20:04]
P: Oh!

[04:00:20:06]
C: Just pull them down.

[04:00:20:16]
P: Got an extra one here.

[04:00:20:18]
C: Okay. Thank you.

[04:00:20:28]
C: Where is my other glove?

[04:00:20:33]
P: You didn't stow it, did you?

[04:00:20:45]
P: Did you find it?

[04:00:20:46]
C: No, I didn't. Here it is! Ha!

[04:00:20:49]
P: I didn't figure it could have gone too far.

[04:00:22:23]
C: Would you fix this one for me, too?

[04:00:22:40]
C: Thank you.

[04:00:22:42]
P: Roger.

[04:00:22:45]
C: ... really got ...

[04:00:23:07]
C: It seems funny to be sitting back down this low
     again.

[04:00:23:14]
P: You really sit right up there, don't you?

[04:00:23:15]
C: Yes.

[04:00:23:25]
P: Let's see if I eject. I'm going out with this
     thing -- up in here, Jim. Because it'll hang up
     otherwise.

[04:00:23:30]
C: Ed, just flick it. We'll be on our backs.

[04:00:23:35]
P: That's why ...

[04:00:23:36]
P: Give me that gun, Jim.

[04:00:23:39]
C: Why?

[04:00:23:40]
P: I'll put it in its bag.

[04:00:23:42]
C: I can make it all right, I think.

[04:00:23:47]
P: Well, why don't you just put it right in here.
     It'll be - contain itself. Anything loose like
     that you have no way to control.

[04:00:23:50]
C: Yes, you're right.

[04:00:23:52]
C: I'm going to just leave the food bags down here,
     though.

[04:00:23:54]
P: Yes, I'm going to put the food bags in my side thing.
     Oh, give me that ...

[04:00:23:59]
_page : 359
C: This you mean?

[04:00:24:02]
P: No, the extra meal. We had an extra meal.

[04:00:24:04]
C: Yes.

[04:00:24:06]
P: Here.

[04:00:24:10]
C: Here it is.

[04:00:24:12]
P: I'm going to put it all in here.

[04:00:24:23]
P: Hey, it's not going to be like - we're going to be
     surprised by ejecting - I don't believe so.

[04:00:24:26]
C: No.

[04:00:24:28]
P: We're going to see the chute or aren't we? If we
     don't, then we know right away that we got to go.
     I'll plan on you pulling the handle though, and
     I'll just hold this strap.

[04:00:24:35]
C: Okay. I'll pull the handle.

[04:00:24:50]
C: Okay. We ought to start thinking seriously about
     really doing the checklist.

[04:00:24:52]
P: Okay.

[04:00:25:40]
P: You got your helmet tied on tight so in case you
     couldn't pressurize. Got your suit all squared
     away so it ...

[04:00:25:50]
C: ...

[04:00:25:54]
P: Yes.

[04:00:25:56]
P: Is it checking right?

[04:00:25:59]
P: Only think I lack is this thing across my knees.

[04:00:26:01]
C: Your glove.

[04:00:26:04]
P: Yes, I'm not going to put that on yet.

[04:00:26:05]
C: I don't even know if I'm going to put mine on. Oh,
     I guess I'd better.

[04:00:26:09]
P: There's no reason why you shouldn't.

[04:00:26:30]
P: Anytime. Anytime.

[04:00:26:35]
C: Finally found them?

[04:00:26:36]
P: Yes.

[04:00:26:45]
C: Are they really?

[04:00:27:41]
C: Okay. Go into ORBIT RATE. Okay, now, you've got
     to plot out the ...

[04:00:27:45]
_page : 360
P: ... time?

[04:00:27:46]
C: Yes.

[04:00:27:47]
P: Well, I've just got to multiply it by two, Jim,
     and a second short.

[04:00:27:52]
C: Okay.

[04:00:27:53]
P: Or just take a second short and multiply it by two,
     and that ...

[04:00:27:59]
C: I mean turn the light ... Are the gyros on?

[04:00:28:06]
P: I'll be with you in 1 minute.

[04:00:28:07]
C: Okay. Yes, why don't you eat that one and then
     we'll ...

[04:00:28:08]
P: Case off.

[04:00:28:16]
C: Check that. Go to RATE COMMAND.

[04:00:28:41]
C: Boy, that mother's really a tight RATE COMMAND.

[04:00:28:47]
P: Tight deadband?

[04:00:28:50]
C: Wow!

[04:00:29:18]
P: Is that my book or your book?

[04:00:29:21]
C: Your book.

[04:00:29:22]
P: I'll put it in my pocket, Jim, if you want me to.

[04:00:29:23]
C: Okay. Turn MSC-1 on.

[04:00:29:26]
P: That's on the checklist, isn't it?

[04:00:29:29]
C: Yes.

[04:00:29:30]
P: Go ahead.

[04:00:29:32]
P: All right.

[04:00:29:40]
C: Okay. Let me finish going over the egress.

[04:00:29:47]
C: And I splash curtain install, neck dam install,
     Cabin Air Recirc handle UP. Left Snorkel handle UP,
     Cabin Vent handle UP. Hatch Release trigger aloof.
     Verify the Water Seal is DOWN and closed. Attach
     the lanyard, left hatch open. Stow Command Pilot
     survival gear over right side of spaceship. Whole
     recovery loop ... right side of the spacecraft.
     What you do is move to the left seat with your survival
     kit. Throw the Pilot's survival gear on the
     left hatch over the recovery loop. Inflate the Mae
     West, be sure it's on the right side of the spacecraft.
     I break a Pilot ... up to you. You'll
     remove your survival gear from the left hatch and
     close and lock the hatch. And you attach the right
     ... That's the last thing in the world that I
     want to be doing out there -- fooling around in the
     water.

[04:00:30:41]
_page : 361
P: I agree.

[04:00:30:47]
C: Can I give you a hand there?

[04:00:30:48]
P: No, go ahead. I'm just checking.

[04:00:30:52]
C: Okay. Let me -- I'll go through the -- no, I'll wait
     for you.

[04:00:30:59]
P: If you're waiting, maybe -- no, ...

[04:00:31:02]
C: Okay.

[04:00:31:04]
P: ... thing in there?

[04:00:31:16]
C: No. Ha! Ha!

[04:00:31:18]
P: You can't forget it.

[04:00:31:26]
P: I go with them off most of the time anyhow.

[04:00:31:30]
C: Almost got it, Ed.

[04:00:31:33]
C: Which one?

[04:00:31:35]
P: The middle one.

[04:00:31:36]
C: The tight one?

[04:00:31:38]
P: The middle.

[04:00:31:40]
C: We've only got two.

[04:00:31:42]
P: Well, let's try that one. Took one off.

[04:00:31:45]
C: The middle one ...

[04:00:32:11]
C: Well, we're about ready to come down, Edward.

[04:00:32:14]
P: I think we are.

[04:00:32:16]
C: It's been very pleasant on occasion, and unpleasant
     on other occasions, for the last 4 days.

[04:00:32:18]
P: Yes. We've had some exciting moments.

[04:00:32:23]
C: Yes.

[04:00:32:28]
C: Well, I guess I might as well close my mike. Boy,
     is it beat up. Look at it.

[04:00:32:40]
P: Yes, so is mine. I bet mine's worse. We've got a
     pre-retro checklist dump.

[04:00:32:50]
_page : 362
C: Okay, here. Stow this away, and we'll go through
     the Preretro Checklist and we'll do it for real.
     No skips.

[04:00:33:02]
P: No skipping ...

[04:00:34:11]
C: Stowage vents are open and drogue pins are out.

[04:00:34:13]
P: Rog. Survival lanyard. Yours connected. Mine
     connected. All right, then. My harness and lap
     belt.

[04:00:34:18]
C: That's your harness and your belt, aren't they?

[04:00:34:19]
_page : 363
P: Yes.

[04:00:34:21]
C: Got your shoulder harness now?

[04:00:34:22]
P: Yes. Secondary O<sub>2</sub>, OPEN.

[04:00:34:23]
C: My Secondary O<sub>2</sub> is OPEN.

[04:00:34:26]
P: You're sure ...

[04:00:34:27]
C: ...

[04:00:34:30]
P: Okay, I'm putting the new tape in.

[04:00:34:33]
C: We're going to run out before we get there.

[04:00:34:40]
P: Okay. I'll hold this and put it in later.

[04:00:34:45]
P: Okay. Elbow support on your side. Unstowed.

     Indicator, with FDI.

[04:00:35:13]
C: With FDI.

[04:00:35:16]
P: Retro Power, ARM.

[04:00:35:18]
C: Retro Power's ARM.

[04:00:35:21]
P: Retro Power RCS, PUSH.

[04:00:35:25]
P: Got them all. Good.

[04:00:35:28]
C: Retro Power, OFF.

[04:00:35:30]
P: Retro Power, SAFE. OAMS Power, OFF.

[04:00:35:33]
C: OFF.

[04:00:35:35]
P: Attitude Control RATE COMMAND.

[04:00:35:37]
C: RATE COMMAND.

[04:00:35:40]
P: Test rings A and B.

[04:00:35:45]
C: They're firing, aren't they?

[04:00:35:46]
P: Yes.

[04:00:35:52]
C: Looks a lot looser this time.

[04:00:35:57]
_page : 364
P: Check them both?

[04:00:36:00]
C: Yes, what's the matter? Okay.

[04:00:36:06]
P: Did they have return?

[04:00:36:09]
C: Yes.

[04:00:36:11]
P: Okay. Did they all check? - you don't like one of
     them?

[04:00:36:30]
C: Let me go to DIRECT.

[04:00:36:33]
P: Let me make sure that you're in PRIMARY here.

[04:00:37:04]
C: Getting a lot of yaw with my -- I think we got one
     of the Ring B thrusters off.

[04:00:37:17]
P: Which one, Jim? Are you getting some yaw with the
     pitch?

[04:00:37:25]
C: Yes, I get some yaw with the pitch.

[04:00:37:28]
P: You ought to get roll though.

[04:00:37:30]
C: Yes, but the yaw one is taking it out.

[04:00:37:35]
P: Yes.

[04:00:37:47]
P: ... giving you roll?

[04:00:37:49]
P: Did you put that in?

[04:00:37:52]
C: Yes, I put that in.

[04:00:37:54]
C: Okay. I guess it's okay.

[04:00:37:59]
P: Okay. Attitude Control, HORIZON SCAN.

[04:00:38:03]
C: Let's see, you want to go back OFF on these, don't
     we?

[04:00:38:04]
P: Yes, I'm sorry, put those OFF. OAMS Power Attitude
     Thrusters are both good. A is reading 3000. B is
     reading about 2700. The temperatures are a little
     over 60 in each one. About 70 in A ...

[04:00:38:23]
C: No, that's 2400.

[04:00:38:25]
P: That's right, that's right, that's right. 2500 in
     A -- a little under 2500. B is about 2350.

[04:00:38:37]
C: Seems like we don't have much left all of a sudden,
     though, doesn't it?

[04:00:38:45]
P: Event Timer in STANDBY.

[04:00:38:48]
C: STANDBY.

[04:00:38:52]
P: All set for 36.

[04:00:38:57]
_page : 365
C: 36.

[04:00:39:04]
P: Okay. All overhead circuit breakers are CLOSED.

[04:00:39:18]
P: Both coolant pumps are ON. Suit fans are both ON.
     HF transmitting receivers on Reentry. New audio mode
     is on HF. We're not going to be able to do that.
     Leave it on RECORD. ... Push-to-talk. No. 2
     Audio-HF.

[04:00:49:47]
C: Let's stay in RECORD for a while.

[04:00:49:49]
P: Okay.

[04:00:49:52]
C: Oops! The checklist doesn't want to stay there.

[04:00:49:59]
P: Okay. We checked our thrusters already.

[04:00:50:04]
C: We actually made Thruster Check about 16:04.

[04:00:50:13]
P: I don't know what we're in that anyhow.

[04:00:50:18]
C: Now each can listen without being able to talk ...

[04:00:51:35]
P: What do you think of the night retro?

[04:00:51:40]
C: It's for the birds.

[04:00:51:47]
P: It's not a bad horizon though.

[04:00:51:49]
C: No.

[04:00:51:54]
P: If you had a little moon, you'd be all right.

[04:00:52:00]
C: I guess you could get down. Ha! Ha!

[04:00:52:21]
C: My gloves don't feel right.

[04:00:52:23]
P: You haven't had them on.

[04:00:52:25]
C: No, that wire's really gouging me in the hand. I
     wonder -- if I bend them.

[04:00:52:30]
P: Are you sure you haven't got this too tight?

[04:00:52:32]
C: No, it was really bad before I tightened that up.

[04:00:52:40]
P: You might go through a few ... gyrations.

[04:00:52:52]
C: Okay. We're going to go to CAGE now.

[04:00:52:54]
P: Yes.

[04:00:53:30]
C: Okay. What do we do at T<sub>R</sub>-30 seconds?

[04:00:53:34]
P: We checklist then.

[04:00:53:42]
P: You've got to start your timers going on a hack from
     Carnarvon. Then go through and aline the platform
     again. Get your Controller and stuff out.

[04:00:54:41]
_page : 366
C: ... pick up early. I don't want to get seasick.

[04:00:54:45]
P: I don't either.

[04:00:54:47]
C: Hey, you got a couple up there you probably ought to
     get out of there.

[04:00:54:49]
P: Okay.

[04:00:54:51]
C: You all right?

[04:00:54:57]
P: Start your burn. It's 16 44 01.

[04:00:54:59]
C: 16 44 01. All right.

[04:00:55:01]
P: Retro time 16 56 01 or minus 12.

[04:00:55:31]
C: 2+40 is OAMS Retro. Right? Is it not?

[04:00:55:37]
C: How are we going to handle that clock time? Are
     you going to countdown for me?

[04:00:55:40]
P: Yes.

[04:00:55:42]
C: I'll just fly away, and then when we get down to
     2:30, you give me a mark when we've been gone through
     30 minutes.

[04:00:55:47]
P: I'll talk to you just as we go along. I'll give you
     a mark at 1-2-30-20-10 and count. Okay?

[04:00:55:54]
C: Okay. Why don't you give me a mark at the end of
     a minute.

[04:00:55:57]
P: Yes.

[04:00:55:59]
C: At the end of 2 minutes, then start counting down
     from 30 when I've got 30 seconds to go. Tell me
     30 seconds, 20 seconds, 10 seconds, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

[04:00:56:09]
P: That's exactly what I said. That's good.

[04:00:56:11]
C: I just wanted to make sure that that's what you said.

[04:00:56:13]
P: Right. Okay.

[04:00:56:15]
C: After so many clocks that we've been talking about.

[04:00:56:28]
C: How long is it to RET? To 400 K? 2+38? Seems
     awfully short.

[04:00:56:34]
P: Yes.

[04:00:56:35]
P: You sure you're looking at the right one?

[04:00:56:37]
P: Positive.

[04:00:56:40]
C: Okay.

[04:00:56:49]
P: We've had lot of them read up to us that short.

[04:00:56:51]
_page : 367
C: Yes, I guess we did. But none of them were over
     there. The OAMS retro is always a lot shorter.

[04:00:56:57]
P: Oh, yes. You're down.

[04:00:57:40]
C: Don't let me retrofire at 16°. Remember, it's 30°.

P: Okay.

[04:00:57:52]
C: There's something about the amount of fuel that I
     have shown on my quantity gage, and the amount of
     retrofire that we got here, that just doesn't figure
     out.

[04:00:58:01]
P: It should be higher.

[04:00:58:04]
C: Yes, it looks like it. No, I mean on my OAMS
     propellant.

[04:00:58:06]
P: Oh, you mean -- you mean--

[04:00:58:09]
C: Quantity reading.

[04:00:58:11]
P: Yes, you mean you feel we're going to burnout short.

[04:00:58:15]
C: Yes.

[04:00:58:18]
C: ... 42 percent. About 100 -- 120 pounds showing.
     That doesn't allow any cushion. Well, if we burn,
     out short, that means we're going to overshoot -
     long. So we can adjust our retrofire time forward
     2 sec/sec.

[04:00:58:52]
P: Hey, you want to get a few things dead ahead. You're
     not going to use your FDI scale, are you? Want to
     set it on HIGH?

[04:00:58:59]
C: No, I'm going to use in on LOW for rate for the OAMS
     retrofire.

[04:00:59:02]
P: Okay.

[04:00:59:11]
C: Ed ...

[04:00:59:12]
P: You're going to fly ACME. Right?

[04:00:59:14]
C: Going to fly ACME.

[04:00:59:16]
P: Okay. And if you holler, I'll give you a different
     one.

[04:00:59:20]
C: Yes, and I'm going to fly roll gyros in all three?

[04:00:59:23]
P: Right, and I'll be watching when --

[04:00:59:26]
C: You knock off the roll if it looks as though I need
     it.

[04:00:59:33]
_page : 368
C: That sure was a peculiar way that thing was firing
     out there. I was getting those yaw jets everytime
     I fired pitch.

[04:00:59:49]
P: You didn't do that in DIRECT, did you?

[04:00:59:52]
C: No, I didn't. Yes, I still got them in DIRECT.

[04:00:59:53]
P: Did you?

[04:00:59:55]
_extra : Section CARNARVON
C: I turned the roll off. No, I turned the roll off
     and just used pitch.

[04:01:00:03]
CC: Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.

[04:01:00:04]
C: Roger, Carnarvon, Gemini 4. We're reading you loud
     and clear.

[04:01:00:07]
CC: Roger. Read you loud and clear. How are you doing
     with your Pre-Retro Checklist?

[04:01:00:09]
C: The Pre-Retro Checklist is complete.

[04:01:00:12]
CC: Roger. I would like to give you a G.m.t. time hack
     at 16 17 00.

[04:01:00:18]
C: Roger. 16 17 00.

[04:01:00:21]
CC: Roger. About 30 seconds from now.

[04:01:00:25]
C: Okay. Give me a mark at 30.

CC: MARK!

[04:01:00:27]
C: Okay.

[04:01:00:33]
CC: Okay. We show your RCS readings ... You're looking
     good here.

[04:01:00:37]
C: Roger.

[04:01:00:39]
CC: I've got some times for you. Got a pencil and
     paper ready to copy?

[04:01:00:42]
P: Ready?

[04:01:00:43]
C: Ready.

[04:01:00:45]
CC: You say you're ready?

[04:01:00:47]
C: Roger. We're ready.

[04:01:00:49]
CC: Begin blackout 5+23. End blackout 9+21. 50 K feet,
     10+55. Main chute 12+33. Splash 17+10.

[04:01:01:18]
_page : 369
C: Get them all?

[04:01:01:21]
P: Right.

[04:01:01:23]
C: Okay. We've got those times. Thank you.

[04:01:01:25]
CC: Roger.

P: Don't you want to go ahead and verify the 240?

[04:01:01:30]
CC: Set up your Event Timer for 36 minutes and in about
     2 and 1/2 minutes I'll give you a mark to countdown.

[04:01:01:35]
C: All right. Will you verify GMTRC for 63-1?

[04:01:01:37]
CC: Okay. 63-1 with maneuver, 16 56 01. 63-1 without
     maneuver 16 50 40.

[04:01:01:47]
P: Well, what we need --

[04:01:01:49]
CC: ...

[04:01:01:54]
C: Did you want anything else?

[04:01:01:57]
C: Okay, roger. Could you give me the time to start
     rolling 400,000 feet?

[04:01:02:03]
CC: Okay. With maneuver 2+38. Without maneuver 7+03.

[04:01:02:16]
C: Roger. Thank you.

[04:01:02:17]
CC: Roger.

[04:01:02:20]
CC: Are you ready to check your thrusters 9 and 10?

[04:01:02:23]
C: I've already checked my thrusters 9 and 10.

[04:01:02:25]
CC: Okay. Are they very good?

[04:01:02:27]
C: Roger. Both good.

[04:01:02:28]
CC: Okay.

[04:01:02:31]
C: You want to check that?

[04:01:02:33]
P: What?

[04:01:02:35]
C: You want to check that. Oh, you're just going to
     leave that for them.

[04:01:02:37]
P: Yes.

[04:01:02:39]
C: Okay.

[04:01:03:09]
C: Smell that ammonia again, Ed?

[04:01:03:11]
P: Do you?

[04:01:03:24]
CC: Okay. Have you got your Event Timer all set up?

[04:01:03:28]
C: All set at 36 minutes.

[04:01:03:31]
_page : 370
CC: Okay, in about 30 seconds I'll give you a countdown.

[04:01:03:52]
CC: 5,4,3,2,1. MARK!

[04:01:03:59]
C: Roger. Counting down.

[04:01:04:01]
CC: Okay. Very good.

[04:01:04:06]
P: Okay. Got your Event Timer counting down.

[04:01:04:08]
C: Yes.

[04:01:04:15]
P: Attitude Control, DIRECT, or whatever you are going
     to do?

[04:01:04:16]
C: Yes.

[04:01:04:18]
P: FDM, Rate.

[04:01:04:19]
C: Yes.

[04:01:04:20]
P: FDI, LOW?

[04:01:04:21]
C: Yes.

[04:01:04:23]
P: Maneuver Controller, UNSTOWED?

[04:01:04:24]
C: I think that's okay. Go ahead. Reading now ...

[04:01:04:25]
P: Yes. I'm just going to go right down the list.
     OAMS Power, MANEUVER and ATTITUDE.

[04:01:04:28]
C: Right.

[04:01:04:32]
P: Spacecraft 0-90-0. Okay. We didn't do that before.
     No sweat. All right, we completed that.

[04:01:04:37]
C: Right.

[04:01:04:42]
P: Okay. Check operation of aft firing thrusters.
     Spacecraft is 0-80-0. OAMS Power, ATTITUDE.

[04:01:04:49]
C: Yes.

[04:01:04:52]
P: Attitude Control, HORIZON SCAN.

[04:01:04:54]
C: I'm alining. Go ahead.

[04:01:04:56]
P: FDR, PLATFORM. FDM, ATTITUDE.

[04:01:05:01]
C: Right.

[04:01:05:03]
P: Platform blunt-end-forward. Are you sure you want
     ATTITUDE on there, Jim?

[04:01:05:06]
C: Yes, I'm alining the platform. Go ahead.

[04:01:05:08]
P: Okay.

[04:01:05:11]
C: The Attitude Control, PULSE.

[04:01:05:12]
C: PULSE.

[04:01:05:13]
_page : 371
P: Null FDI's to aline platform.

[04:01:05:16]
C: Right. Nulling FDI's to aline platform. That's what I'm doing now.

[04:01:05:18]
P: Okay. You're ahead of the checklist.

[04:01:05:20]
C: Right.

[04:01:05:23]
P: Now, no ground update.

[04:01:05:25]
C: Where did we end up with the OAMS Power, Maneuver,
     OAMS Power Switch? MANEUVER and ATTITUDE is in
     ATTITUDE.

[04:01:05:30]
P: It's in ATTITUDE and you'll get it at the minus 13.

[04:01:05:35]
C: Okay.

[04:01:05:54]
P: Okay. We're good now until minus 22.

[04:01:05:56]
C: All righty. What happens at minus 22?

[04:01:06:01]
P: Platform blunt-end-forward. Attitude Control, PULSE,
     null FDI's (Ha! Ha!) and aline platform.

[04:01:06:06]
CC: Is there anything else you want up there, Gemini?

[04:01:06:08]
C: Negative. Well, I do still need my computer, but I
     can't think of any way to bring it up.

[04:01:06:15]
CC: Yes, I know what you mean.

[04:01:06:18]
P: Okay, now till minus 13, there's nothing to do except
     you get that platform alined.

[04:01:06:19]
CC: I'll buy you a new one.

[04:01:06:20]
C: Okay.

[04:01:06:25]
P: I'm going to go back and re-verify the whole stuff
     we've done.

[04:01:06:28]
C: Okay. Very good.

[04:01:06:32]
P: Okay. When I finish this, I'll put a new tape in.

[04:01:06:37]
C: Okay.

[04:01:06:56]
C: We're going to have the most alined platform in the
     world. We will have been alined for an hour. We'll
     probably come out of the darkness facing sideways.

[04:01:07:01]
P: Yes, that'll be a shock.

[04:01:08:06]
C: Hey, Ed, you know we always said that we were going
     to make an open loop reentry. I'm much happier that
     the computer failed and not the ...

[04:01:08:14]
P: Yes, I'd rather be that way.

[04:01:08:16]
_page : 372
C: At least we have an attitude reference for retrofire
     and all the other operations. Hey, did we turn our
     batteries ON?

[04:01:08:20]
P: No, they don't come on yet. They come on down here
     right in the minus 13.

[04:01:08:44]
P: You have a minute.

[04:01:08:54]
C: Temperature is not coming down much.

[04:01:08:56]
P: No.

[04:01:08:59]
C: Wonder why we don't have the cabin fan ON.

[04:01:09:11]
P: Wonder if that's not on here.

[04:01:09:16]
C: Did you go off the checklist?

[04:01:09:18]
P: Yes.

[04:01:09:37]
P: The batteries will come on the T<sub>R</sub>-5 checklist.

[04:01:09:40]
C: All right. I guess we don't have to worry about
     venting the ECS O<sub>2</sub> anymore, do we? Ha! Ha!

[04:01:09:45]
P: No.

[04:01:09:54]
C: You have your Secondary O<sub>2</sub> on too, don't you?

[04:01:09:56]
P: Yes, mine's been on the whole flight.

[04:01:09:58]
C: Very good.

[04:01:10:04]
C: Hm! Hm! ... circuit breakers on ...

[04:01:10:07]
P: No, I've been very sedate.

[04:01:10:18]
P: I don't feel like I can strain as much as I used to
     be able to.

[04:01:10:20]
C: Right now, you mean.

[04:01:10:23]
P: Yes. Do you?

[04:01:10:25]
C: No. I feel pooped out.

[04:01:10:28]
P: I tell you, I don't feel like straining anymore.

[04:01:10:30]
C: Yes.

[04:01:10:31]
P: You feel that way, too?

[04:01:10:37]
C: Yes, I feel completely fatigued. Yes ...

[04:01:10:42]
P: No, it's not a fatigue, I don't know --

[04:01:10:45]
C: It's a very funny feeling ...

[04:01:10:46]
P: I can't quite put my finger on it.

[04:01:11:28]
_page : 373
P: The new tape for the retro is tape no. 15, and I've
     got tape no. 14 loose and I'll put it -

[04:01:11:42]
C: Hey, in case you didn't ... the neck dam. I got
     two of them.

P: Yes. Okay, I did too.

[04:01:11:44]
C: As a matter of fact, so do you.

[04:01:11:45]
P: Right.

[04:01:11:48]
C: Do you have two of them in that suit?

[04:01:11:49]
P: Yes.

[04:01:11:50]
C: How many did you have in the other one? Two in that
     one, too?

[04:01:11:54]
P: I think I only had one in there.

[04:01:12:03]
C: I'm going to pop my ears.

[04:01:12:12]
C: Ears popped.

[04:01:12:14]
P: Roger.

[04:01:12:16]
C: You're not going to pop yours, are you?

[04:01:12:18]
P: No, I just cleared them. They're clear.

[04:01:12:25]
C: We ... to clear them like that.

[04:01:12:26]
P: Ha! Ha!

[04:01:12:38]
C: Okay. Let's just go through our procedures a little
     bit.

[04:01:12:44]
C: T<sub>R</sub>-5. What are you going to do?

[04:01:12:47]
P: I've got a checklist to complete.

[04:01:12:49]
C: Okay. What is it?

[04:01:12:52]
P: I'm going to start the G.m.t. stopwatch per your
     time hack. I've already done about half of it. I'm
     going to put the Main Batteries ON. Verify RCS
     Propellant A and B -- ON.

[04:01:13:04]
P: I'll verify that now. I'll check it again, but -

[04:01:13:06]
C: Okay.

[04:01:13:09]
P: Antenna Select to REENTRY, and it's already on
     REENTRY. Propellant gage RCS-B, and I've already
     set it to B. Quantity, OFF. Quantity is OFF. Indicate
     Retro Attitude, and I'll ... I guess you've
     got to have something on over there for me to do
     that, though.

[04:01:13:32]
_page : 374
C: I've (illegible) have something (illegible) Retro Power.
     Remember we've always had that thing out of order.

[04:01:13:38]
P: Yes. Okay.

[04:01:13:40]
P: Let's put that Retro Power thing at T<sub>R</sub>-5 for you to do.

[04:01:13:42]
C: Okay.

[04:01:13:56]
P: Okay. I'll hit Indicate Retro Attitude, Sections 1
     and 2 Power Control-OFF. Then you have some things:
     Platform-ORBIT RATE, FDR-PLATFORM, FDM-RATE, FDI
     Scale-High. Verify Rate Gyros-PRIMARY. I've already
     done this. Attitude-RATE COMMAND.

[04:01:14:20]
P: You're in PULSE now.

[04:01:14:25]
P: RCS Power A and B-ACME, OAMS Power OFF, OAMS Propellant - OFF. Control spacecraft to 0, 180 and -30. We're at minus 180 but not minus 30 yet.

[04:01:14:40]
C: Right.

[04:01:14:42]
P: At that time you'll put the Retro Power to ARM, but
     we're going to move that up to the beginning so I
     can indicate retro attitude.

[04:01:14:49]
P: Okay.

[04:01:14:50]
C: Right.

[04:01:14:52]
P: Then you'll report the minus 5 completed.

[04:01:14:55]
C: Okay.

[04:01:14:56]
P: Okay. At that time I'll turn the Transmitter-Receiver
     HF OFF. No. 2 -- RECORD. We should state
     that. Now at minus 1 I'll push OAMS, ELECTRIC and
     ADAPT. OAMS, ELECTRIC and ADAPT.

[04:01:15:10]
C: Not too fast.

[04:01:15:11]
P: No. We want to listen carefully so we can tell our
     good buddies about it.

[04:01:15:13]
C: Roger.

[04:01:15:16]
P: Okay, at minus 30 you will arm the squibs-up and at
     minus 10 seconds. I go to the AUTO RETRO and I'll
     -- no, we won't even use that.

[04:01:15:37]
C: No. We'll do it, though --

[04:01:15:39]
P: Let the ...

[04:01:15:42]
C: Okay.

[04:01:15:45]
_page : 375
P: I'll manually fire. We're not going to use auto
     retros, are we?

[04:01:15:49]
C: No.

[04:01:15:50]
P: No, we are too.

[04:01:15:51]
C: They can still run -- I don't know whether they got
     the load in or not. Did he say they had the load
     in?

[04:01:15:54]
P: Yes.

[04:01:15:56]
C: TRS will fire them.

[04:01:15:58]
P: TRS is working all right.

[04:01:16:00]
C: Okay. He said that.

[04:01:16:01]
P: I'll delay that a little bit. Ha! Ha!

[04:01:16:04]
C: Yes. Delay it till about 5. How about that?

[04:01:16:06]
P: Yes. Okay. I'll put that on at minus 5, and I'll
     fire on the time -- on the count of zero. No delay
     on that time.

[04:01:16:16]
C: Nope.

[04:01:16:18]
P: Put you to FREE here, and I'll watch with bated
     breath as we fire our retro rockets.

[04:01:16:26]
C: Yes. Don't forget to put me to FREE, because we
     might not -- you know, it may not go.

[04:01:16:33]
P: I've been putting you to FREE as a regular thing --
     on all training. After retrofire monitor yaw, check
     Comp Light-ON. We don't have that Platform-FREE.
     Okay, I'll have that.

[04:01:16:44]
P: Report to Guaymas numbers of retros, IVI readings,
     estimated -- all you're going to have to do is report
     the number and the attitude.

[04:01:16:52]
C: Good.

[04:01:16:56]
P: Okay. After retros, ES sensor-OFF. We have a RET
     checklist to go through. Do you want me to go
     through that now?

[04:01:17:04]
C: Yes. Jettison Retro if you want to.

[04:01:17:06]
P: Yes, the Retro Jettison ARM first. Jettison Retro.
     Report Jettison retros to Guaymas. Retro Power-SAFE,
     Retro Jet-SAFE, Retro Squibs-SAFE. FDR -- might as
     well leave that on ATTITUDE.

[04:01:17:22]
_page : 376
C: No. I'm going to leave it on RATE.

[04:01:17:25]
P: ATTITUDE or COMP-? You going to leave it on
     PLATFORM?

[04:01:17:30]
C: PLATFORM or COMPUTER. Yes, I'll leave it on PLATFORM.

[04:01:17:32]
P: Yes. Right.

[04:01:17:37]
P: You're going to leave it on RATE too, aren't you?

[04:01:17:38]
C: Yes.

[04:01:17:40]
P: The FDI will be on LOW.

[04:01:17:43]
C: Okay.

[04:01:17:44]
P: The attitude control -- you going to use Rate Command
     or Reentry Rate Command?

[04:01:17:48]
C: Reentry Rate Command.

[04:01:17:50]
C: Okay. We're coming up on 22 minutes.

[04:01:17:54]
P: Okay, aline your platform.

[04:01:17:58]
C: Ha! Ha! Look, we've driven the temperature down to
     55 in here!

[04:01:18:04]
P: Now we'll suddenly start swimming, huh?

[04:01:18:08]
P: You read the times off, because you have a good hack
     around that area.

[04:01:18:22]
C: Next thing we do is at 13. Right?

[04:01:18:25]
P: Right.

[04:01:18:30]
P: Okay. And that should be at 16 43 01. 22+9 minutes.

[04:01:18:44]
C: It looks like we're still right-side-up out there.

[04:01:18:54]
C: Boy, I really smell that ammonia.

[04:01:18:59]
C: Do you?

[04:01:19:01]
P: No, I don't. Jim, let me tell you something.

[04:01:19:08]
C: It has something to do with wetting your pants,
     doesn't it?

[04:01:19:11]
C: No, this is about the strongest I've ever smelled
     it. We really screwed up when we went with this
     padding here. I wonder if -- gee, look there at the
     cabin vent.

[04:01:20:42]
P: Okay. I'll review a few times -- for you.

[04:01:20:45]
P: Okay.

[04:01:20:47]
_page : 377
P: The time to 400,000 K will be 2+38.

[04:01:20:54]
C: Right.

[04:01:20:56]
P: Blackout will commence at 2+38.

[04:01:20:59]
C: Blackout at 2:23.

[04:01:21:01]
P: 5+23. Correction.

[04:01:21:02]
C: 5+23. Okay.

[04:01:21:03]
P: And ends at 9+21.

[04:01:21:04]
C: Okay.

[04:01:21:06]
P: 50 K and drogue is 10+55.

[04:01:21:11]
C: Okay.

[04:01:21:13]
P: Main chute at 12+33.

[04:01:21:15]
C: Okay.

[04:01:21:16]
P: Landing is 17+10.

[04:01:21:18]
C: Okay. You'll have to call those out to me again
     when we get going.

[04:01:21:20]
P: Yes. I've got them all written here.

[04:01:21:28]
C: Okay. We're at 18:30 minutes.

[04:01:21:40]
P: And you give me a mark when you start the burn.

[04:01:21:42]
C: Right.

[04:01:21:46]
C: We'll probably get a countdown from the ground, too.
     We'll have a multiplicity of countdowns.

[04:01:21:53]
P: None of which will probably agree in some respects.

[04:01:21:55]
C: Yes.

[04:01:21:59]
P: Oh, here's your ...

[04:01:22:01]
C: Right.

[04:01:22:02]
P: That's for really only -- that's the important one
     there.

[04:01:22:04]
C: Right.

[04:01:22:25]
P: And if you should get hurting somewhere in there,
     let me know.

[04:01:22:30]
C: Okay.

[04:01:22:33]
C: I'll just say, "you've got it."

[04:01:22:34]
P: Yes.

[04:01:23:01]
_page : 378
C: Wonder if Paul Haney has the crowd worked up to a
     frenzy. Ha! Ha!

[04:01:23:04]
C: I don't know.

[04:01:23:18]
C: Come on now. Let's not be burping.

[04:01:23:21]
P: I'm thinking about the food.

[04:01:23:23]
C: Ha! Ha!

[04:01:23:25]
C: Ah, the sun's coming up.

[04:01:23:28]
P: Okay. I'll recheck all the switches again.

[04:01:23:30]
C: Very good, old boy.

[04:01:23:36]
C: All on?

[04:01:23:50]
C: Got some brilliant fireflies out there. Boy, there
     is one of them that is really pretty.

[04:01:23:54]
P: Yes, I see them

[04:01:23:56]
C: 16 minutes.

[04:01:24:04]
C: Retrofire - retrofire's more fun than launch. You
     know nothing's going to stop it - it just counts
     down.

[04:01:24:12]
P: Yes. That's right.

[04:01:24:16]
C: In launch you have to be concerned about whether
     the gantry is going down.

[04:01:24:23]
P: What about that gantry?

C: Shades of MA-9!

[04:01:24:25]
C: Same thing here too, in a way -- losing the computer.

[04:01:24:30]
P: Yes.

[04:01:24:31]
C: The way Gordo lost the ...

[04:01:24:35]
C: Where did I have that?

[04:01:24:45]
P: Boy, I don't have any reference. Do you?

[04:01:24:47]
C: No.

[04:01:24:49]
C: I have fireflies.

[04:01:24:52]
P: This would be a tough retro --

[04:01:24:54]
C: Oh boy!

[04:01:24:55]
P: ... time to retro, wouldn't it?

[04:01:24:56]
P: You couldn't see anything.

[04:01:24:59]
C: 15 minutes from now.

[04:01:25:01]
_page : 379
P: Okay. We've got 3 minutes till our burn.

[04:01:25:07]
C: Start giving a T<sub>R</sub>-13 checklist at 14.

[04:01:25:10]
P: Okay.

[04:01:25:13]
P: Start Comp. You don't need to do that.

[04:01:25:16]
C: You've got another minute.

[04:01:25:18]
P: Oh, okay.

[04:01:25:20]
C: I've got to wee-wee.

[04:01:25:35]
_extra : Section HAWAII
C: Shoot. I'm going to have the best alined platform
     we've ever had in the whole world.

[04:01:25:39]
CC: Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.

[04:01:25:40]
C: Hello Hawaii, Gemini 4.

[04:01:25:42]
CC: Roger. Are you in attitude for your OAMS burn?

[04:01:25:44]
C: I am.

[04:01:25:45]
CC: Roger. I will give you a 5 second countdown to
     start of OAMS burn.

[04:01:25:52]
C: Roger.

[04:01:25:53]
CC: Stand by, and I will stand by for a mark on completion
     of OAMS burn from you.

[04:01:25:57]
C: Roger.

[04:01:25:59]
C: Okay, Edward. Let's go through the 14 minute --
     13 minute checklist.

[04:01:26:01]
P: Okay. Start Comp-PUSH. Platform-ORBIT RATE.

C: 0, 180, 0.

[04:01:26:27]
P: You're in good shape.

[04:01:26:30]
P: You'll burn at 15 34 01, counting on your timer,
     and we'll get a countdown, I guess.

[04:01:26:38]
P: I'll still give you some talk.

[04:01:26:39]
C: Right.

[04:01:26:40]
P: Unless they're bothering us so I can't.

[04:01:26:42]
C: No, he said they're going to stand by for my mark.

[04:01:26:44]
P: Okay.

[04:01:26:49]
C: Okay, I'll tell you when we've got a minute.

[04:01:26:54]
C: Thirteen on my mark.

[04:01:27:40]
C: Yes. It is.

[04:01:27:44]
C: Okay, 15 seconds.

C: I'm going to put pressure in the line.

[04:01:27:52]
CC: 5,4,3,2,1. MARK! Start burn.

[04:01:28:01]
P: Okay. I've got a good hack.

[04:01:28:07]
C: Attitudes are holding smoothly.

P: Coming up on 1 minute.

[04:01:28:56]

[04:01:30:38]
P: Good show!

[04:01:30:42]
P: How about that?

[04:01:30:43]
CC: Roger, Gemini 4. How were your attitudes during
     your firing?

[04:01:30:45]
C: They were within about a degree.

[04:01:30:48]
CC: Roger. Roger.

[04:01:30:50]
P: Okay, IVI. ... OAMS fire attitude.

P: FDR-PLATFORM.

[04:01:30:58]
C: PLATFORM.

[04:01:30:59]
P: FDM -- it says ATTITUDE. You probably want RATE,
     don't you?

[04:01:31:02]
C: RATE. Well, let's go aline the platform some more.

[04:01:31:04]
P: Attitude Control PULSE -- Yep. Blunt-end-forward.

[04:01:31:06]
P: Null FDI's to aline platform computer REENTRY. Okay.

[04:01:31:18]
P: I'll be standing by for the minus 5.

[04:01:31:28]
C: It's showing about 3 percent fuel remaining.

[04:01:31:32]
P: Okay.

[04:01:31:34]
_page : 382
C: Now, if that conversion table was right, we got the
     first part down exactly right.

[04:01:31:43]
C: Oh, by the way, I checked it and compared with ...
     table.

[04:01:31:49]

CC: 1 - MARK!

[04:01:31:59]
C: Roger, got your mark.

[04:01:32:08]
C: ... T<sub>R</sub>-5 and -6. Okay.

[04:01:32:11]
P: Okay.

[04:01:32:13]
C: Some of it anyway.

[04:01:32:16]
P: Yes, well, I can't do much of it, Jim.

[04:01:32:18]
C: Okay.

[04:01:32:20]
P: I didn't want to put the main batteries on. All you
     do there is ORBIT RATE, platform FDM RATE, FDI scale
     HIGH. Go to RATE COMMAND. ACME. OAMS OFF. And go
     to minus 30.

[04:01:32:46]
C: Right.

[04:01:32:48]
P: Now I'm going to ask for Retro Power ARM right after
     minus 5.

[04:01:32:52]
C: Okay.

[04:01:33:18]
C: I don't know why I'm doing all this in the Platform
     Alining mode. It's not really good.

     minus 5, right?

[04:01:33:26]

[04:01:33:29]
P: Okay, I'm half a second from you. I think I can't
     sweat that.

[04:01:33:32]
C: You can't have everything, Ed.

[04:01:33:39]
P: Well, we got somebody's OAMS retro. I'm not sure any
     more whose that is.

[04:01:33:44]

     before -- a second before your countdown. Attitude
     probably was within about a degree or so.

     You're probably about 40 or 50 miles short.

     would. I guess you're waiting for them.

[04:01:45:47]

P: Okay. We're starting to oscillate. The drogue
     caught it.

[04:01:50:53]
CC: Gemini 4, you should have drogue by now.

[04:01:50:54]
C: We've got the drogue out now.

[04:01:50:56]
P: About 40° oscillation.

[04:01:50:59]
P: Whang, whang, whang. - Okay.

[04:01:51:01]
C: Let's go to RATE COMMAND.

[04:01:51:03]
P: Rog.

[04:01:51:06]
P: Pretty good oscillation, old buddy.

[04:01:51:08]
C: Yes. It is, isn't it?

[04:01:51:11]
P: Yes, the Rate Command doesn't seem to - Ah! Dampened
     it out.

[04:01:51:15]
C: Okay, we're at 28,000, Ed.

P: Okay, I can see the drogue up there, too.

[04:01:51:18]
C: We got a good drogue. It's holding fine.

[04:01:51:25]
C: 23.

[04:01:51:27]
P: Okay.

[04:01:51:30]
C: Let me see if the drogue is going to hold it by
     itself.

[04:01:51:31]

P: I've got one of your arm rests. Get your D-ring.

[04:01:51:35]
C: Okay.

P: Get your D-ring out, Jim.

[04:01:51:37]
C: Roger. ... coming off. Have I got it?

[04:01:51:40]
P: Yes.

[04:01:51:43]
C: I guess I should get our D-ring out, shouldn't I?

[04:01:51:45]
P: Huh? Right.

[04:01:51:49]
C: Okay, 16,000.

[04:01:51:51]
P: Okay, I'm in a position to eject, if necessary.

[04:01:51:52]
C: Okay, Ed. Let's hope we don't have to.

[04:01:51:58]
C: Roger, Cape Control. We're just about ready to put
     the parachute out. Stand by.

[04:01:52:05]
C: Okay, parachute's coming.

[04:01:52:11]
C: See it?

[04:01:52:12]
P: I don't see it yet.

[04:01:52:13]
C: Yes, I see it.

[04:01:52:15]
C: It looks good, Ed, babe.

[04:01:52:16]
P: Right in the sun. I can't see it.

[04:01:52:20]
C: Looks good.

[04:01:52:21]
P: Good chute.

[04:01:52:22]
C: There's the de-reef.

[04:01:52:23]
P: And it's a good one, isn't it?

[04:01:52:25]
C: Nobody can read me now, but does that parachute look
     great!

[04:01:52:29]
CC: Gemini 4, you should be coming upon main chute
     deploy.

[04:01:52:30]
P: You're not kidding!

[04:01:52:32]
C: Okay, take your blood pressure quickly.

[04:01:52:33]
P: All right.

[04:01:52:35]
C: We're at 6000 ...

[04:01:52:37]
P: Ah, shoot. It came out.

[04:01:52:40]
C: Did it come out?

[04:01:52:42]
P: Yes. Stand by.

[04:01:52:43]
_page : 394
C: Hurry up, we can't wait too much longer.

[04:01:52:45]
P: This is the important one for them though.

[04:01:52:47]
C: I know it, I know it.

[04:01:52:49]
C: How do you feel? I feel great.

[04:01:52:52]
P: I felt kind of funny during the spinning.

[04:01:52:53]
C: I was dizzy during ...

[04:01:52:54]
P: I was, too. Okay, it's coming out now.

[04:01:52:55]
C: Coming out now?

[04:01:52:59]
P: Oh, no, no, no! Don't go yet.

[04:01:53:00]
C: Okay.

[04:01:53:06]
C: Ready?

[04:01:53:07]
P: No.

[04:01:53:10]
C: Come on, I'm not going to wait past 5000.

[04:01:53:14]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM, Do you read?

[04:01:53:15]
P: Okay, just a minute. Make sure it goes all the way
     down.

[04:01:53:17]
C: Okay, you ready?

[04:01:53:18]
C: We're at 5000 on my mark.

[04:01:53:20]
C: 2, 1, MARK!

[04:01:53:23]
P: That wasn't so bad.

[04:01:53:25]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.

[04:01:53:26]
C: Couple of broken arms, and you're all right.

[04:01:53:27]
P: Okay.

[04:01:53:30]
C: Gemini 4, here. We're right-side up. Two point on
     the parachute, and everything's fine.

[04:01:53:36]
CC: Roger. Understand. Everything is fine. We should
     have a helo to you in about 5 or 10 minutes after
     you're on the water.

[04:01:53:40]
C: Okay. Don't let them wait too long. I want to get
     rescued in a hurry. Tell Doc Berry we got a blood
     pressure.

[04:01:53:42]
P: Okay, D-ring covered.

[04:01:53:49]
C: Take another one, too.

[04:01:53:51]
P: Yes. D-ring?

[04:01:53:53]
_page : 395
C: D-ring covered. We don't want that one out.

[04:01:53:54]
P: No.

[04:01:53:55]
C: How you feeling, Ed?

[04:01:53:56]
P: I feel good. How about you?

[04:01:53:59]
C: So do I. I feel great.

[04:01:54:00]
P: Feel like a tiger. Feel like I could eat him up.

[04:01:54:03]
C: Feel a little warm. Let's see.

[04:01:54:04]
P: Okay.

[04:01:54:05]
C: Cabin temperature's only 55. Suits are 70.

[04:01:54:14]
CC: Say again, Jim.

[04:01:54:16]
C: The cabin temperature is only 55. The suits are up
     to about 70.

[04:01:54:25]
C: Our poor spacecraft's all burned up.

[04:01:54:28]
CC: Roger. Both of you feeling okay?

[04:01:54:30]
C: Yes, we're both feeling great, Gus.

[04:01:54:31]
CC: Good.

[04:01:54:32]
P: Clean the electrical switches out, Jim, while I sit
     here.

[04:01:54:35]
C: Okay. Let me get them.

[04:01:54:45]
P: I've got the Rescue Beacon ON already.

[04:01:54:51]
C: Rog.

[04:01:54:53]
CC: Let us know as soon as you're on the water.

[04:01:55:01]
C: Hey, we got some weather ...

[04:01:55:02]
P: Okay, the heater's OFF. You got it? Good RCS.

[04:01:55:06]
C: How are you feeling, Ed?

[04:01:55:07]
P: I feel good.

[04:01:55:09]
C: Hey, there goes the R & R can off to one side.

[04:01:55:17]
CC: Say again.

[04:01:55:20]
C: The R & R can is floating down with us.

[04:01:55:22]
CC: You're coming in a little garbled. Try to talk
     slower.

[04:01:55:26]
C: Our R & R can is coming down right next to us.

[04:01:55:30]
CC: We can't reach you, Jim, you're fading out too much.

[04:01:55:31]
_page : 396
C: Okay, we're at 1000 feet, Ed.

[04:01:55:32]
P: Okay.

[04:01:55:35]
C: Now get ready. Remember water.

[04:01:55:40]
P: I'll stand by. Water seal. Let's go down -

[04:01:55:41]
CC: Oh! Okay. The R & R can is floating by.

[04:01:55:44]
C: Let's go down now. Okay, you get the Inlet Snorkel
     UP when we hit.

[04:01:55:45]
P: When we hit. I'm standing by on it.

[04:01:55:46]
C: I'll jettison the parachute.

[04:01:55:52]
P: Get ready for arrival.

[04:01:55:55]
C: Roger. We got 300 feet.

[04:01:55:56]
P: 300 feet.

[04:01:55:57]
C: As John says, how do you get ready for the arrival?

[04:01:56:00]
CC: We figure you ought to be touching down in about
     20 seconds.

[04:01:56:02]
C: Roger, we're indicating 100 feet right now.

[04:01:56:08]
P: Pretty good impact. Okay. Jettison the chute.

[04:01:56:14]
C: Chute's gone.

[04:01:56:15]
P: Yes, and your inlet snorkel's UP.

[04:01:56:19]
C: Okay, let's see if we're leaking.

[04:01:56:22]
C: Yes, but are we leaking? That's the big thing.

[04:01:56:24]
P: No, I don't think we're fuming. I don't hear any
     gurgling.

[04:01:56:28]
P: Okay.

[04:01:56:30]
P: Whoo! I smell something, but I don't think it's bad.
     Gee, I feel great!

[04:01:56:38]
C: So do I, Ed! That wasn't too bad!

[04:01:56:40]
P: Yes, buddy. Good show!

[04:01:56:45]
C: Okay, let's finish up the checklist.

[04:01:56:47]
P: Let's clean every switch up in this mother.

[04:01:56:58]
C: Gemini 4's on the water, and we're floating fine.
     No leaks.

[04:01:57:01]
P: I smell a little of that stuff.

[04:01:57:02]
C: Yes.

[04:01:57:13]
_page : 397
C: Oh, are our sea dye markers out?

[04:01:57:15]
C: Let's see. You got the Rescue Beacon ON?

[04:01:57:16]
P: Yes. I put that on right away.

[04:01:57:20]
C: Put it on with the light if they're that close.

[04:01:57:22]
P: Okay.

[04:01:57:27]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. How do you read?

[04:01:57:30]
P: Okay, let's go to HF.

[04:01:57:31]
C: Okay.

[04:01:57:35]
P: Ye-hoo!

[04:01:57:36]
P: Okay, let me give you this one, Jim.

[04:01:57:40]
C: Don't you have one over there, really?

[04:01:57:41]
P: Yeah, it's packed with garbage on top of it. It
     really stinks in here, doesn't it? Let's go to O<sub>2</sub>
     High Rate, you want to? Get some fresh air?

[04:01:57:45]
P: Yes.

[04:01:57:52]
C: What's the matter? O<sub>2</sub> High Rate doesn't come on.
     I guess we must have all the lights off ...

[04:01:58:20]
P: Negative, Omnibus.

[04:01:58:25]
P: Roger, read you 5 square, Omnibus.

[04:01:58:27]
P: Hello, Omnibus ... Gemini 4.

[04:01:58:40]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston.

[04:01:58:45]
P: You're coming through five square, and you're sounding
     great. There's nothing you can do but pull us out.

[04:01:59:01]
P: Well, what alternatives do we have right now?

[04:01:59:15]
P: Roger, can you put the collar on us with the helo?

[04:01:59:19]
P: Can you put the collar on us with the helo?

[04:01:59:24]
P: Roger. We'd like to come out with the collar and
     with the helo.

[04:01:59:38]
C: Listen, we'd better get those.

[04:01:59:55]
CC: Gemini 4, Houston. You're about 40 to 50 miles
     from the aircraft carrier.

[04:02:20:41]
CC: Gemini 4, this is Omnibus 64. Your rescue helo is
     coming in to put the collar on for you now. Over.

_page : 398
C: Coming now, Roger. Roger. Roger.

[04:02:20:53]
CC: The Peek-a-boo would like to know the condition of
     you two. Are you both in good shape?

[04:02:20:58]
C: We're both in excellent shape. That's affirmative.

[04:02:21:00]
CC: Roger! Roger!

[04:02:21:56]
CC: Gemini 4. The doctors would like to know if you're
     going to return in your space suits or not. Over.

[04:02:22:00]
_extra : (The astronauts get out of the capsule)
C: Roger. We'll stay in our space suits for one more
     blood pressure.
