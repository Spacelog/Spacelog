C: 31 minutes. Now we are seeing a lot of stars.

[00:00:31:44]
P: That could be a light.

[00:00:31:49]
C: ... I see a light on the ground.

[00:00:31:56]

C: Hello, Houston CAP COM. Now we're reading you all okay. Gemini VIII.

[00:00:35:36]
CC: Roger. This is my first call. Don't forget your Radiator to FLOW at 035.

[00:00:35:41]
P: Okay. Radiator going to FLOW.

[00:00:35:42]
CC: Roger. And around 00 40, the C-Reentry to COMMAND, the C-Adapter to CONTINUOUS and the S-3 Experiment.

[00:00:35:54]
C: I didn't quite get that. Would you say again, please?

[00:00:35:57]
CC: Roger. At 40, the C-Reentry to COMMAND, the C-Adapter to CONTINUOUS and the Frog Egg Experiment.

[00:00:36:07]
C: Roger. We have that.

[00:00:36:10]
CC: Roger. We're just standing by.

[00:00:38:08]
P: It reminds me of an oil flame that you see over Texas.

[00:00:38:11]
C: ... here ... We're at 38 minutes and I noticed the thrusters are firing out the right side only. Now this may be a Platform Mode, or it could be due to the fact that it's taking care of the water boiler exhaust.

[00:00:38:20]
C: 38 minutes elapsed time. The night side - we have a well-definable horizon, but we have stars visible below the horizon, and that one property in comparing the horizon is probably the best one to make a mark on.

[00:00:39:01]
P: Okay. At 40 minutes and about 10 seconds, the S-3 Unit Number 1 is activated.

[00:00:40:25]
P: Okay.

[00:00:40:26]
P: 41 minutes. We're going to Primary Scanner on the Horizon Scan and no appreciable difference in Primary or Secondary Scanner operation; going to Primary CATCH-UP in 50 minutes and --

CC: Gemini VIII, Hawaii CAP COM.

[00:01:17:01]
CC: This is Gemini 7/6 enroute Honolulu. Do you read?

[00:01:17:06]
CC: Gemini, this is Hawaii. We have a computer load for you. Are you ready? Over.

[00:01:17:15]
C: We're all set.

[00:01:17:16]
CC: Roger. Transmitting computer load.

[00:01:17:23]
C: Roger. Got DCS, Height-Adjust.

[00:01:17:26]
CC: Roger. And are you ready to copy the update? Over.

[00:01:17:40]

[00:01:17:55]
C: Okay. Go with the update, Hawaii.

[00:01:17:57]
CC: Roger. GET B 1 34 37; Delta-V, 2.9; burn time, 0 plus 05; yaw 0, pitch 0; Address 25, 90029; Address 26, all zeros; Address 27, all zeros; thrusters forward; Maneuver Retrograde. Did you copy?

[00:01:18:34]
_page : 15
CC: That is 26, all zeros. Roger. 27, all zeros. Thrusters forward and Maneuver's Retrograde. Did you copy?

[00:01:18:53]
P: Roger, Hawaii. Got it. GET B burn, 01 34 37; Delta-V, 2.9; duration, 0 plus 05; yaw 0, pitch 0; Address 25, 90029; 26 all zeros; 27 all zeros; both confirmed; thrusters forward; Maneuver's Retro.

[00:01:19:19]
CC: That's correct. Also be advised that Wally Schirra has been trying to contact you. His call sign is Gemini 7/6. He's inbound to Honolulu.

[00:01:19:31]
P: Oh, very well. We're standing by.

[00:01:19:44]
P: Has he got HF?

[00:01:19:50]
P: Is he trying to contact us by UHF or HF?

[00:01:19:52]
CC: He was on UHF. We haven't heard him for a couple of minutes.

[00:01:19:57]
P: Okay.

[00:01:20:03]
P: Okay. Let's see how we get the IVI's. What do you say?

[00:01:20:08]
C: Okay. Catch-up and we'll see what happens.

P: ... this ... Forward firing thrusters, Retrograde burn at 1 34 37.

[00:01:20:36]
C: ... that's 14 minutes from now.

[00:01:20:38]
P: Okay. Now we want to do a Platform Aline before that.

[00:01:20:42]
C: It's really not required - for 3 feet per second, I don't think.

[00:01:20:44]

P: Does that concur with ...?

[00:01:20:46]
C: What does it say in the Flight Manual?

P: ...

[00:01:21:01]
CC: Gemini, this is Hawaii. We have nothing further for you. Standing by.

[00:01:21:06]
P: Okay. All good and well up here.

[00:01:21:09]
P: Yes. You want to aline it as good as you can. It says 15 minutes prior ... allow Platform Mode to aline platform.

[00:01:21:18]
C: 1 34 37 is start time. ...

[00:01:21:27]
P: You understand ... Platform. You can see out the window that it's - no, that it's 90 degrees, anyway.

[00:01:21:42]
C: ...

[00:01:21:43]
P: If you aline it, it takes the ...

[00:01:21:44]
C: I agree.

[00:01:21:46]
C: If you aline it in a 3-feet-per-second burn, if you are 10 degrees off on the Platform, it'd be hard for us to see it, as far as the Delta-V operation is. So why don't we - as we come upon the stage we'll put it in SEF for a little while. Well, 5 minutes before you're supposed to go to ORBIT RATE. Okay. I'll just put it in SEF COMP right now. Kind of fun.

[00:01:22:28]
P: It really kicks it around there, doesn't it?

[00:01:22:31]
C: Yes. It's winding right up.

[00:01:22:41]
P: Wonder where we'll be at 1 34. Oh, I know! It's on the - on the - we'll be right over Houston on this pass.

C: Yes, we took out the residuals, but they seem to be building up on us with time.

[00:01:37:31]
CC: Roger. That is part of your accelerometer bias.

[00:01:44:02]
P: Yes. You're right.

[00:01:44:04]
C: - - because we're not going to get much of a chance after - we've got the best part of an hour here.

[00:01:44:35]

[00:04:43:55]
P: That's what I thought you said. Okay.

[00:04:43:58]
CC: Otherwise, sounds good.

[00:04:44:04]

[00:05:29:59]
P: Any time you say.

[00:05:30:06]
C: Okay.

[00:05:30:25]
C: I'm about two-tenths high, I think.

[00:05:30:44]
C: Now we're getting some error ...

[00:05:30:59]
C: An error, I'm afraid.

[00:05:31:06]
P: Got a Mark in 10 seconds - about 10 seconds.

[00:05:31:09]
C: Okay.

[00:05:31:12]
P: 4, 3, 2, 1,

[00:05:31:16]
P: MARK.

[00:05:32:33]
C: Range-Rate is pretty erratic, I'm afraid.

[00:05:32:47]
P: We've got to get 3 aft and 2-1/2 up.

[00:05:32:49]
C: Okay. I like that.

C: Okay. I just don't like the Out-Of-Plane, but - -

[00:05:42:11]
CC: Gemini VIII, CSQ. We have nothing for you. We'll be standing by.

[00:05:42:13]
P: We're on the way.

[00:05:42:16]
CC: Roger.

[00:05:42:18]
P: 2 1/2 miles out in Closed Loop.

[00:05:42:21]
CC: Roger.

[00:05:42:28]
P: Is there any ...?

[00:05:42:35]
C: Okay. I'm losing my star background.

[00:05:42:40]
P: Okay. 2.1 miles, 45 feet per second - 49 feet per second.

[00:05:42:43]
C: You're - okay.

[00:05:42:45]
P: For this range you're in pretty good shape. You're almost nominal for this range.

[00:05:42:52]
C: Okay. I'm going to start braking down a little bit very shortly here because we're at 15K. We're inside 15K and I'd like to - -

[00:05:43:04]
P: Yes, we're inside 15K.

[00:05:43:08]
C: How about if I brake off?

[00:05:43:09]
P: Yes, I agree.

[00:05:43:25]
C: Okay. Now give me a digital range for the remainder of 20 seconds.

[00:05:43:37]
P: Okay. You're 10,000 feet.

[00:05:43:40]
C: Okay. And Range Rate?

[00:05:43:41]
P: 44 feet per second, but let me get another readout on that.

[00:05:43:44]

C: Okay. I'm reading.

[00:05:43:47]
P: Ready.

[00:05:43:59]
P: 36 feet per second.

[00:05:44:08]
C: We'll have the horizon coming into view pretty soon and probably the sun in our eyes. In case that happens, I'll have to go to FULL-BRIGHT on the instruments.

[00:05:44:16]
P: That's okay. Go ahead.

[00:05:44:25]
C: Okay.

[00:05:44:32]
P: It looks pretty reasonable to me.

[00:05:44:35]
C: Anything you can tell now - -

[00:05:44:36]
P: You're looking good. 8100 feet, 39 feet per second, I get.

[00:05:44:40]
C: I'd better back off a bit.

[00:05:44:41]
P: Back off ...

P: Coming up.

[00:05:47:19]
P: 19 feet per second.

[00:05:47:20]
C: Okay. I'm going to back off a little more.

[00:05:47:22]
P: Okay.

[00:05:47:44]

P: Yes, I can't either. Outstanding job, Coach!

[00:05:53:13]
C: Way to go, Partner!

[00:05:53:16]
P: You did it, boy! You did a good job!

[00:05:53:17]
C: It takes two to tango.

[00:05:53:20]
P: Say again?

[00:05:53:21]
C: It takes two of us.

P: I like 7. You buy 7 feet per second?

[00:05:53:52]
C: Yes.

P: Do I ever! I'll say I see everything on that fellow!

[00:05:54:17]
P: I've got 18 pictures.

[00:05:54:18]
P: I don't have the range sight on. Hope I'm hitting them.

C: ...

[00:05:54:30]
P: Yes.

C: I'm in 25. ...

[00:05:54:34]
P: No! Heck no!

[00:05:54:36]
P: Dang target. You should be at infinity, 1/200 and f 16.

[00:05:54:54]
P: No, we don't have a spot in here. I guess we'll have plenty of time to do that.

[00:05:55:04]
C: Okay. Now I'll get back to work.

[00:05:55:11]
P: 240 feet ...

[00:05:55:23]
P: 5 feet per second we're still getting.

[00:05:55:25]
C: Okay. ...

[00:05:55:37]
C: I guess we could turn the ACQ lights off.

[00:05:55:42]
P: Yes. I'll go back to the Check List.

[00:05:55:52]
P: Okay. 250 coming up.

[00:05:55:57]
P: Got a MAP?

[00:05:56:01]
C: Okay. Now 230.

[00:05:56:02]
P: Okay.

[00:05:56:05]
P: UHF DISABLED. You agree?

[00:05:56:08]
C: Yes.

[00:05:56:10]
P: Got a MAP?

CC: Gemini VIII, Gemini VIII, this is Houston CAP COM. Standing by for any Rendezvous remarks. Over.

[00:05:56:19]
_page : 60
P: You tell them.

[00:05:56:23]
C: Flight Houston, this is Gemini VIII. We're Stationkeeping on the Agena at about 150 feet.

[00:05:56:30]
P: ...

[00:05:56:35]
P: Yaw left ...

[00:05:56:37]
P: That's good.

[00:05:56:42]
P: Right. Now I'll get a better picture.

[00:05:56:47]
P: Got the SPOT Meter over there anywhere handy?

[00:05:56:50]
C: ... It's supposed to be at the back of the box here.

[00:05:56:57]
P: Okay. Stay on the Agena. Don't sweat this one. We'll be around for a long time yet.

[00:05:57:08]
P: Okay. What does your Propellant Quantity read now?

[00:05:57:11]
C: 55 percent.

[00:05:57:13]
P: That's nice.

[00:05:57:20]
C: Gemini VIII is Stationkeeping on the Agena.

[00:05:57:32]
P: Back to the Flight Plan. We just started today.

[00:05:57:37]
C: That's right.

[00:05:57:38]
CC: Gemini VIII, this is Houston. You are unreadable. We will stand by for Hawaii acquisition.

[00:05:57:39]
C: Okay. We have here - I guess I can turn the radar to STANDBY.

[00:05:57:42]
P: Yes, radar STANDBY.

[00:05:57:54]

[00:05:59:03]
CC: Roger. How are you doing?

[00:05:59:04]
C: Stationkeeping at about 150 feet.

[00:05:59:08]
CC: Roger. Have you transmitted UHF DISABLE?

[00:05:59:11]
C: That is correct.

[00:05:59:12]
CC: Roger. We have an SPC load to transmit. Would you ENABLE it, please?

[00:05:59:17]
C: Sure will.

[00:05:59:23]
C: 231, coming up.

[00:05:59:25]
C: I didn't get it. We'll have to pitch down a little bit here.

[00:05:59:35]
P: We're on a radar STANDBY. No wonder.

[00:05:59:37]
P: Radar ON.

[00:05:59:38]
C: Was it STANDBY?

[00:05:59:39]
P: It was STANDBY ...

[00:05:59:41]
C: Okay.

[00:05:59:44]
P: Okay. 231.

[00:05:59:48]
C: Got a MAP?

[00:05:59:52]
P: I can't find it.

[00:06:00:18]
CC: Gemini VIII, Hawaii.

[00:06:00:20]
C: Go ahead.

[00:06:00:23]
CC: Roger. Would you turn off your Encoder, please?

[00:06:00:30]
C: Okay.

[00:06:00:35]
_page : 62
C: Doing a little POA work up here.

[00:06:00:43]
P: Our Agena looks in fine shape. The TDA is out. It's Rigidized. The whiskers are sticking out as expected on the TDA. The dipole is up. The engine looks good. And we've turned the ACQ lights off.

[00:06:00:45]
CC: Roger. Copy.

[00:06:00:52]
P: I don't believe it!

[00:06:00:54]
CC: Gemini VIII. We'd also like an OAMS propellant reading.

[00:06:00:56]
C: We're at 55 percent.

[00:06:00:59]
CC: Say 59?

[00:06:01:01]
C: That's 55 percent.

[00:06:01:04]
CC: 55. Roger.

[00:06:01:06]
CC: We're standing by to copy the Agena-Status Display Panel readings.

[00:06:01:11]
P: Yes, you better get it - -

[00:06:01:12]
C: Okay. We'll have to get over on that side of it.

[00:06:01:23]
P: Better get busy - -

[00:06:01:24]
CC: Gemini VIII, Hawaii.

[00:06:01:25]
C: Stationkeeping here.

[00:06:01:26]
P: Go ahead.

[00:06:01:29]
CC: We have a Yaw Maneuver time for you, if you're ready to copy.

[00:06:01:35]
P: Okay. Go ahead.

[00:06:01:37]
CC: Roger. Yaw Maneuver at 07 10 00. That's GET.

[00:06:01:48]
P: Roger. Understand. Yaw Maneuver 07 10 00.

[00:06:01:52]
CC: Also, when you are at plus 96 degree heading, the Agena will go to Flight Control Mode 7 for 30 seconds.

[00:06:02:04]
_page : 63
P: Understand. 96 degree FC-7 for 30.

[00:06:02:07]
CC: And the SPC load we're transmitting contains the Agena clock reset. We're very anxious for it to be executed even if it cuts short the Platform Parallelism.

[00:06:02:20]
P: What was that? Did you catch it?

[00:06:02:23]
C: No I didn't.

[00:06:02:24]
C: Say that last one again, please.

[00:06:02:25]
CC: Roger. The SPC load we're transmitting contains a clock reset for the Agena.

[00:06:02:32]
P: Roger.

[00:06:02:33]
CC: We're anxious for it to be executed - even if it means cutting the Platform Parallelism test short.

[00:06:02:41]
P: Roger. Understand. The SPC has priority over the Platform Parallelism.

[00:06:02:47]
P: In essence. Is that right?

[00:06:02:49]
CC: That's affirmative.

[00:06:02:51]
P: Okay.

[00:06:02:59]
C: Man! That's great!

[00:06:03:01]
P: Man, that's really slick!

[00:06:03:08]
C: A bit of all right!

[00:06:03:11]
P: Okay. The first thing we really have to do - Platform Parallelism 06 50 to 07 10. They're giving us the SPC loaded Yaw Maneuver. It looks like at nominal time. So they're going to give you that time.

[00:06:03:27]
P: Now I'll check your little Status Display for you.

[00:06:03:40]
P: I bet those Lockheed guys are just jumping up and down.

[00:06:03:41]
C: The S-10 is on.

C: Man, it flies easy! I'd love to let you do it, but - -

[00:06:03:56]
P: Oh no!

[00:06:03:57]
C: I think I better get my practice while I can.

[00:06:03:59]
P: Man, I'll have my chance!

[00:06:04:00]
C: Get yours later. Okay?

[00:06:04:04]
P: Yes. I wouldn't even take it if you gave it to me.

[00:06:04:09]
P: It's up to you; stick with it.

[00:06:04:11]
P: More you get now, the better off you're going to be when - -

[00:06:04:13]
C: Do we have STB bright?

[00:06:04:16]
P: Should have.

[00:06:04:18]
P: I think I'll get the section here in a minute and we'll be able to see something. Let me check the systems. Cabin pressure, that's good.

[00:06:04:28]
P: Your OAMS source pressure is 190.

[00:06:04:35]
C: 1900?

[00:06:04:37]
P: You always get me on those.

[00:06:04:40]
P: ECS O<sub>2</sub> is rather high. 810.

[00:06:04:44]
C: When that sun comes in, boy it is warm!

[00:06:04:52]
C: Man, this is easy!

[00:06:04:53]
P: Is it really?

[00:06:04:54]
C: This Stationkeeping, there's nothing to it.

[00:06:04:56]
_page : 65
C: I can't understand why our recorder isn't working.

[00:06:05:01]
P: I don't either, except maybe it's not running.

[00:06:05:04]
P: Want me to turn to OFF now?

[00:06:05:07]
C: Tape recorder is on but just doesn't budge now.

[00:06:05:09]
C: Sure does.

[00:06:05:13]
P: Oh, oh! Fuel Cell H<sub>2</sub> Heater circuit breaker popped.

[00:06:05:20]
P: I'm trying to reset it. It's reset.

[00:06:05:25]
C: Okay. Now a - this is - this is getting into Stationkeeping attitude for EDA. Boy ...

[00:06:06:01]
P: Okay. I can see the Status Display. - Main Green, Secondary HI, ON; Secondary LO, ON; Power and Attitude, ON.

[00:06:06:11]
C: Okay.

[00:06:06:13]
C: That means everything should be - -

[00:06:06:15]
P: I can't see any dark line on those - just too far away now.

[00:06:06:23]
C: Okay.

[00:06:06:25]
P: I'll give this sextant a 1/10 - a little ...

[00:06:06:30]
P: We're still - -

[00:06:06:32]
CC: Gemini VIII, Hawaii.

[00:06:06:33]
C: Go ahead.

[00:06:06:35]
CC: We'd like to know when you first saw the acquisition lights as you approached.

[00:06:06:39]
C: We'll have to go back on the data and dig that out.

[00:06:06:42]
CC: Roger.

[00:06:06:43]
C: About 45 ...

[00:06:06:44]
_page : 66
P: No. No it's about 56 miles. Right?

[00:06:06:52]
C: No, not 56. I think it was 45 miles.

[00:06:06:53]
P: We think it was 45 miles, but we'll have to check on the tape.

[00:06:06:56]
CC: Roger. Copy. And we're ready to copy the readouts if you have them now.

[00:06:07:05]
CC: The readings from the Status Display Panel.

We copied as far as you had sent Commmnd 041 RECORDER ON, and at that time the Spacecraft started to roll. Would you continue from there, specifically what your on-board switch positions were and what you did with it?

[00:08:11:23]
C: We had Attitude Control POWER on and went to RATE COMMAND.

[00:08:11:27]
CC: Roger.

[00:08:11:47]
C: And when we started to yaw - it seems that it was the Agena control system.

[00:08:11:53]
CC: Roger.

[00:08:11:54]
C: Since we did not hear any of our thrusters fire.

[00:08:11:59]
CC: Roger.

[00:08:12:03]
CC: Stand by ...

[00:08:12:05]
_page : 80
C: And we sent ACS OFF and turned the Spacecraft power on, OAMS power on, and tried to regain control of the combination.

[00:08:12:15]
CC: Roger.

[00:08:12:19]
C: And we were just barely able to hold our own, but the rates were too excessive for an undocking, so we continued to attempt to send an ACS OFF-cycle ... and at the same time we checked our OAMS switch position.

[00:08:12:34]
CC: Roger.

[00:08:12:39]
C: We switched it - we tried to turn our own Spacecraft Control System off and the combination continued to wind up, so we had to go back on before the rates became intolerable.

[00:08:12:53]
CC: Roger.

[00:08:13:00]
C: After we got the rates down to a point where we felt we could safely undock, we did so, and maneuvered away from the Agena at several feet per second as quickly as possible. We had been watching our propellant quantity go down from 50 to below 30 percent. After turning the OAMS off and still in bias power and everything - motor valves off, we were still rolling; we activated the RCS. Did not have any ACME, and we regained control of the Spacecraft in DIRECT, slowly.

[00:08:13:51]
CC: Roger.

[00:08:13:55]
C: Then after getting stabilized, we checked out our whole Thrust Control System and found that we had no yaw or roll control - or we had no yaw control of the yaw thrusters since our roll was in the yaw jets, and after that - -

[00:08:14:15]
P: ACS was really going.
C: - - we had - vision; we could see the ACS thrusters firing on the Agena when we had ACS off, so we felt that something was definitely wrong.

[00:08:14:29]
CC: Roger.

[00:08:14:30]
_page : 81
C: After checking the Spacecraft systems we found Thruster Number 8 apparently failed OPEN at the present time and this could have been true at the time of the incident, although we can't - cannot verify that at this time.

[00:08:14:44]
CC: Roger. Stand by. We'll update that new T<sub>R</sub> time.

[00:08:14:53]
P: Got it.

[00:08:14:54]

[00:08:15:18]
C: What's the T<sub>R</sub>?

[00:08:15:19]
CC: T<sub>R</sub> time is for Area 7-3, which is approximately an hour and 15 minutes from now.

[00:08:15:29]
C: What's our next AOS?

[00:08:15:33]
CC: Next AOS should be CSQ.

[00:08:15:36]
P: Give us a time for that, please.

[00:08:15:51]
P: 8 52, T<sub>R</sub> is at 9 - -

[00:08:15:53]

[00:08:16:21]
CC: Gemini VIII, RKV. Did you blow the OAMS REG switch?

[00:08:16:27]
C: No, we have not yet. We thought about it but we don't need to yet, I guess.

[00:08:16:34]
CC: Roger.

[00:08:16:48]
P: Oh shoot! How am I ever going to stow that visor? I've got to put the TV monitor in, too.

[00:08:16:58]
C: Yes, I know you do.

[00:08:17:00]
C: Do you want to do that before you get too tied up?

[00:08:18:10]
