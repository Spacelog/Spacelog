            "The crew for the first crewed test flight of the Apollo Command/Service Module had been announced in March 1966, aiming for a launch date of February 21, 1967. Training took place throughout 1966 and early 1967, as the capsule to be used for the flight was completed and underwent testing and preparation by NASA.",
            "On January 27, 1967, the crew were in the Command Module for a 'plugs-out' test of the spacecraft's internal power system. Following a brief power failure, and subsequently believed to be caused by insufficiently-insulated wiring, a fire broke out in the cockpit. Despite the crew's attempts to follow emergency procedure, they were unable to exit the capsule, and were overcome by carbon monoxide produced by the fire.",
            "They gave their lives in service to their country in the ongoing exploration of humankind's final frontier. Remember them not for how they died but for those ideals for which they lived."

        "narrative_notes": [
            "After the accident, NASA suspended crewed flight tests for more than a year, resuming only once a number of changes were made to the capsule design. Despite the set back the goal of the Apollo program, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth, was achieved before the end of the decade.",
            "All three members of the crew were posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honour. An Apollo 1 mission patch was left on the surface of the Moon by the lunar crew of Apollo 11."
