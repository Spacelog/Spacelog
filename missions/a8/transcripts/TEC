CC: Good show. Thank you.

[00:03:43:25]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:03:43:31]
LMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[00:03:43:32]
CC: we would like to take control of the DSE for a
     while, Bill.

[00:03:43:35]
LMP: Go ahead.

[00:03:43:36]
CC: Thank you.

[00:03:43:54]
_page : 6
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We would like to get an
     approximate GET of your SEP maneuver to use for
     our ephemeris tracking data.

[00:03:44:06]
CDR: Roger. It was 3 hours 40 minutes zero seconds.

[00:03:44:10]
CC: Good, 03:40 and a foot and a half - feet per second.
     Right?

[00:03:44:15]
CDR: Roger. About that --

[00:03:44:16]
CC: Okay.

[00:03:44:18]
CDR: -- We have the - Mike, we have the exact
     callout here for you and a burn status report.

[00:03:44:22]
CC: Alright.

[00:03:44:28]
CDR: Alright, DELTA-V<sub>X</sub> minus 00011, DELTA V<sub>Y</sub> plus
     0002, DELTA-V<sub>Z</sub> minus 0002, roll 0, pitch 180,
     yaw 0. Over.

[00:03:44:46]
CC: Roger, Apollo 8.

[00:03:46:25]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:03:46:29]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[00:03:46:31]
CC: Roger. At your convenience, would you please
     go P00 and ACCEPT? We're going to update to
     your W matrix. And also when you get a chance,
     we would like to know about the SLA panels. Did
     they all depart? And do you have any comments
     about the SLA?

[00:03:46:43]
CDR: They all departed, and they worked fine.

[00:03:46:47]
CC: Okay. Thank you.

[00:03:46:58]
CDR: We are in P00 and ACCEPT.

[00:03:47:00]
_page : 7
CC: Thank you.

[00:03:48:26]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8. Will you give us the
     information when you want us to stop the venting
     and so on?

[00:03:48:32]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Roger.

[00:03:50:39]
CC: Apollo 8. Houston.

[00:03:50:42]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[00:03:50:44]
CC: Roger. What is the venting information are
     you inquiring about: the O<sub>2</sub> flow high out
     through the waste tank or waste compartment, or
     are you talking about your evaporator?

[00:03:50:53]
CDR: Evaporator. We are configuring now to stop
     boiling.

[00:03:50:56]
CC: Okay.

[00:03:50:58]
CC: We concur in that.

[00:03:51:02]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. You can go back to BLOCK.
     We have gotten in the load to the W matrix
     update.

[00:03:51:10]
CDR: Roger.

[00:03:51:58]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8. The back pressure valve is
     closed, and the water flow is OFF.

[00:03:52:03]
CC: Back pressure valve closed, and water flow OFF.
     Thank you.

[00:03:53:04]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8 here.

[00:03:53:05]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.

[00:03:53:07]
_page : 8
CDR: Roger. It looks like I might have to do a couple
     more small maneuvers to stay away from the front
     of this S-IVB, the way we are ending up now. Do
     you want me to do these with our P47 if we have to
     do them?

[00:03:53:19]
CC: Standby one, Frank.

[00:03:53:28]
CC: That's affirmative, Frank, on this P47.

[00:03:53:30]
CDR: Okay. And give me the time again when it starts
     to dump, please.

[00:03:53:35]
CC: Roger. We're working on an exact GET of that,
     Frank.

[00:03:53:48]
CDR: Roger.

[00:03:54:54]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:03:54:57]
CDR: Go ahead.

[00:03:54:58]
CC: I'd like to give you some idea about your trajectory.
     It looks like a midcourse correction
     number 1, projected out to TLI plus 6 hours,
     would be only 7 feet per second. So, of course,
     any further maneuvers you do would add to that,
     which is probably good.

[00:03:55:24]
CDR: I just want to stay from away from in front of
     this thing.

[00:03:55:27]
CC: Roger. We concur. Looks like it is chasing
     you, huh?

[00:03:55:32]
CDR: Yes.

[00:03:55:53]
LMP: OMNI D.

[00:03:56:01]
_page : 9
CDR: Boy, it's starting to vent now, blowing down.

[00:03:56:07]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Say again.

[00:03:56:09]
CDR: The S-IVB is really venting.

[00:03:56:13]
CC: Roger. Understand; that is supposedly a non-propulsive
     vent. The big blowdown maneuver, it
     starts maneuvering to blowdown attitude at
     04:44:55, and the vent occurs at 05:07:55.

[00:03:56:32]
CDR: 05:07:55.

[00:03:56:34]
CC: Roger.

[00:03:56:35]
CDR: That is the nonpropulsive vent, but it's pretty
     spectacular. It's spewing out from all sides
     like a huge water sprinkler.

[00:03:56:45]
CC: Roger. Get some pictures of it.

[00:03:56:48]
CDR: We are.

[00:03:57:07]
CDR: Say again that big vent time, so I can write it
     down please, Houston.

[00:03:57:11]
CC: Roger. Big vent time 05:07:55, and it will start
     maneuvering to vent attitude beginning at
     04:44:55. Bill has got the tape recorder back.

[00:03:57:32]
CDR: Thank you. Roger.

[00:03:58:31]
CDR: We're receiving VHF music now, Houston. Thank
     you.

[00:03:58:35]
CC: Yes, you took the words right out of my mouth,
     Frank, and we would like to know also how far
     away from the S-IVB you are now.

[00:03:58:48]
CDR: I guess we are between 500 to 1000 feet.

[00:03:58:51]
_page : 10
CC: Roger.

[00:03:58:57]
CDR: Herb Alpert seems pretty good.

[00:03:59:00]
CC: Roger.

[00:04:02:04]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[00:04:02:06]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:04:02:10]
CDR: Roger. I believe we are going to have to vent
     or thrust away from this thing; we seem to be
     getting closer.

[00:04:02:18]
CC: Roger. Understand, Frank; go ahead whenever -
     just give us some idea of when you did it and
     how much.

[00:04:02:24]
CDR: Roger.

[00:04:02:32]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Could you stand by one?
     We are working on something here.

[00:04:02:37]
CDR: Okay.

[00:04:05:10]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:04:05:16]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.

[00:04:05:39]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.

[00:04:05:40]
CDR: You are loud and clear, Mike. Go ahead.

[00:04:05:43]
CC: Okay, Frank. On your additional separation
     maneuver, we recommend that you make a radial
     burn, point your plus X-axis toward the earth,
     and thrust minus X for 3 feet per second.
     Over.

[00:04:05:57]
CDR: I don't want to do that; I'll lose sight of the
     S-IVB.

[00:04:06:01]
_page : 11
CC: Okay. The reason we want a radial burn is to
     increase your midcourse correction so we can
     use the SPS. Stand by on it.

[00:04:06:33]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:04:06:35]
CDR: Go ahead.

[00:04:06:36]
CC: How close to a radial burn can you get without
     losing sight of the S-IVB, Frank?

[00:04:06:41]
CDR: Well, I don't know because I can't see the
     earth now, Mike.

[00:04:06:44]
CC: Okay.

[00:04:06:51]
CDR: We can pitch down some. Jim has the earth in
     the optics so we could pitch some and get
     pretty close to one, I guess.

[00:04:07:31]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:04:07:32]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[00:04:07:34]
CC: We can give you a pitch gimbal angle on radial
     direction if that would be a help. It's
     181 degrees; pitch gimbal angle would be
     exactly radial at 4 hours and 10 minutes. I
     don't know whether that solves your visibility
     problem or not.

[00:04:07:46]
CDR: 181?

[00:04:07:47]
CC: That's affirmative.

[00:04:07:54]
CDR: Well, then zero would be just as good, wouldn't
     it?

[00:04:08:05]
_page : 12
CC: Frank, if you use zero, then make the SEP if
     possible in the plus X thrusters. That's the
     direction of the burn we'd like.

[00:04:08:13]
CDR: Well, can't do that. I'll thrust right square
     into that S-IVB.

[00:04:08:16]
CC: Yes, okay. Understand.

[00:04:08:22]
CDR: What will he maneuver to as far as the gimbal
     angle for his blowdown?

[00:04:09:03]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. At blowdown, that S-IVB
     should be oriented to perform a retrograde
     blowdown along the local horizontal.

[00:04:09:14]
CDR: Okay.

[00:04:09:22]
CC: Is it still chasing? Does it look like it is
     closing on you, Frank?

[00:04:09:25]
CDR: It is about the same. The trouble is it is
     pointed at us pretty well.

[00:04:09:30]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[00:04:10:00]
CC: Frank, what we want to do is get a radial
     upward burn; and as long as you can, through the
     optics or some other means out the window, figure
     out where the earth is, then use the appropriate
     thrusters to thrust upward, radially upward for
     3 feet per second. That is what we are looking
     for for trajectory reasons.

[00:04:10:18]
CDR: Okay. Understand. I just - as I say, I just
     can't very well do that now. I don't want to
     lose sight of this S-IVB.

[00:04:10:26]
_page : 13
CC: Roger. We concur with that. I just thought
     perhaps Jim, through his optics, or you could
     get some feel for where the earth is. That's
     what we want to do, is radially upward.

[00:04:10:35]
CDR: Okay. As soon as we find the earth, we will
     do it.

[00:04:10:37]
CC: Thank you.

[00:04:11:03]
CDR: Houston. The venting on the S-IVB is terminated.

[00:04:11:08]
CC: Roger. Thank you.

[00:04:13:53]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:04:13:55]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[00:04:13:56]
CC: Roger. Frank, do you think you are going to
     be able to do this burn radially? We would
     like to add to its magnitude if you are going
     to make it in some other direction. Over.

[00:04:14:08]
CDR: No, I am not even sure we are going to do it
     yet, Mike. If I can get - we seem to be
     drifting away from this thing a little bit,
     although it is still pointing at us quite
     closer than I'd like.

[00:04:14:20]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[00:04:14:25]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We would like you to do
     some additional maneuver; it is just a question
     of how much and in which direction.

[00:04:14:33]
CDR: Okay. Right now, our gimbal angles are about -
     roll's about 190 and pitch is about 320 and
     yaw is about 340. We could certainly do it
     in this position. That would be alright.

[00:04:14:51]
_page : 14
CC: Stand by. We will check those.

[00:04:17:06]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:04:17:09]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[00:04:17:11]
CC: Roger, Frank. You could help us out if you
     would explain where you are relative to the
     booster. In other words, with respect to the
     earth and the radius back there, are you above
     or below or one side, or where exactly is the
     booster relative to you?

[00:04:17:27]
CDR: Well, it's as I said before. We can't definitely
     find the earth. I think we are in front
     and a little bit above - a little bit above
     the - almost in front of the - directly in
     the front of the booster.

[00:04:17:41]
CC: Roger. Understand; almost directly in front
     of the booster.

[00:04:17:45]
CDR: Perhaps a little bit horizontally displaced
     towards the - let's see - Houston, to help
     you, we are looking right directly above the
     S-IVB with the sun - it's on the right side of
     the S-IVB and on our - coming in our left number
     1 window.

[00:04:18:34]
_extra : Tape 5
CC: Okay. Understand; the sun is on the right side
     of the S-IVB and coming in your number 1 window.
     And are you - when you give us those angles, that
     means that your plus X-axis is pointed at it with
     those angles. Is that affirm?

[00:04:18:47]
_page : 15
CDR: Roger.

[00:04:18:48]
CC: Okay.

[00:04:19:04]
CDR: The earth is in our plus Y, plus Z-direction
     now, Mike.

[00:04:19:09]
CC: Thank you. Earth is plus Y, plus Z.

[00:04:19:12]
CDR: Right, and a little minus X.

[00:04:19:16]
CC: Okay.

[00:04:20:52]
CMP: Houston, for information. I am looking through
     the scanning telescope now, and I see millions
     of stars; most of them - the venting from the
     S-IVB.

[00:04:21:04]
CC: Right. Are you having any trouble telling which
     are the stars and which are the S-IVB particles?

[00:04:21:09]
CMP: Definitely; we are in sunlight, and it looks
     like they are all S-IVB, but we don't know. I
     am going to attempt a P52 realign at this time
     and see what I can do.

[00:04:21:18]
CC: Understand you.

[00:04:26:37]
CDR: Mike, anything more on this separation maneuver
     you're on?

[00:04:26:41]
CC: We are working on it, Frank. We are trying to
     compute what radially outward will be in close
     terms. Now, you still have the earth - as I
     understand plus Y and plus Z quadrant. In other
     words, it's down below you on your right and
     slightly to your rear? Is that still true?

[00:04:26:59]
_page : 16
CDR: That's right. Quite a bit to our rear and down
     below us. Off to the right.

[00:04:27:03]
CC: Okay. Well, we - of course, in that attitude,
     you want to burn some upward and some to the
     left, and we are trying to be more precise than
     that. Frank, is it still about the same distance
     away? Are you opening or closing?

[00:04:27:23]
CDR: It sure is staying close to us.

[00:04:27:25]
CC: Understand.

[00:04:28:03]
CDR: Mike, can you just tell us which way the S-IVB
     pitches and how far it will pitch to the sling
     shot maneuver attitude?

[00:04:28:11]
CC: Roger. Stand by.

[00:04:28:46]
CC: Frank, the S-IVB is within 10 degrees of its
     final attitude at this time.

[00:04:28:52]
CDR: Okay. Thank you.

[00:04:29:00]
LMP: Houston, are you ready to copy the IMU align
     information?

[00:04:29:03]
CC: Go ahead.

[00:04:29:05]
LMP: Alright. Star ID is 03, and star 36, star angle
     difference 0.01, torquing angle X minus 00034,
     Y minus 0027, Z plus 00100. Over.

[00:04:29:33]
CC: Okay, thank you. For Y, I just got four digits
     here: 0027.

[00:04:29:39]
_page : 17
LMP: Roger. Three zeros: 00027.

[00:04:29:43]
CC: Thank you.

[00:04:29:46]
CMP: Houston, we are going to have to hold up on the
     cislunar navigation until after this next little
     maneuver.

[00:04:29:53]
CC: Roger, Jim. We understand.

[00:04:31:20]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:04:31:22]
CDR: Go ahead now, Mike.

[00:04:31:23]
CC: Can you give us an updated readout of your
     gimbal angles. When your plus X-axis is pointed
     toward the booster, please?

[00:04:31:29]
CDR: Roger. Stand by.

[00:04:34:08]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:04:34:11]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[00:04:34:12]
CC: Could you give us those gimbal angles, Frank,
     when you have a chance?

[00:04:34:14]
CDR: I'm getting the COAS right on it now so it will
     be accurate.

[00:04:34:18]
CC: Thank you.

[00:04:34:28]
CDR: Okay. With the COAS right on the S-IVB, the
     roll reads 105, the pitch is 275, and the yaw
     is about 325.

[00:04:34:47]
CC: Roger. Copy roll 105, pitch 275, and yaw 325.

[00:04:34:53]
CDR: Roger. That should be 115 for the roll.

[00:04:35:46]
CC: Thank you. 115 roll.

[00:04:35:52]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. Over.

[00:04:35:58]
_page : 18
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.

[00:04:36:00]
LMP: Roger. If it will help you any, Mike, the
     earth is plus Y about 45 degrees in a minus X.
     I can see it out my side window, and it's a
     beautiful view with numerous cloud vortex.

[00:04:36:15]
CC: Roger, Bill. Thank you. Understand; plus X
     45 degrees halfway between plus Y and plus Z
     and slightly minus X.

[00:04:36:26]
LMP: Negative. It's 45 degrees in the plus Y, in
     the XY plane towards minus X. Over.

[00:04:36:37]
CC: Roger. Understand in the XY plane, toward
     X 45 degrees.

[00:04:36:43]
LMP: Forty-five degrees from plus Y to minus X.

[00:04:36:48]
CC: Roger. Thank you.

[00:04:36:51]
LMP: It's behind us to the right, if that will help.

[00:04:36:54]
CC: Roger.

[00:04:37:15]
CDR: I can still see the Cape and isthmus of Central
     America.

[00:04:37:22]
CC: Roger. Understand. Frank, what we want on
     this burn is 8 feet per second now, 8 feet per
     second. We want it radially upward, and we
     want you to use whatever thrusters are required
     to burn radially upward at 8 feet per second.

[00:04:37:37]
CDR: Why do you want to use - do so much, Mike?

[00:04:37:42]
CC: Because of the separation distance we would
     like to achieve between now and the time of
     S-IVB blowdown.

[00:04:37:53]
_page : 19
CDR: Okay.

[00:04:38:56]
CDR: Mike, do you want me to go ahead and try to
     do this, or are you going to give me some gimbal
     angles?

[00:04:39:05]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead and do it without
     gimbal angles, if you can do that. Over.

[00:04:39:11]
CDR: Okay. I don't understand why you want so many
     feet per second on it, but I think I can - with
     just a little maneuvering, I can get away from
     it a lot simpler than that.

[00:04:39:22]
CC: Well, we would like the radial upward for trajectory
     reasons, and the magnitude we'd like
     because of the separation distance which we're
     predicting you will have at S-IVB blowdown.

[00:04:39:31]
CDR: Okay.

[00:04:39:54]
CDR: VHF sounds good.

[00:04:39:57]
CC: Roger. On the VHF.

[00:04:41:25]
CMP: OMNI B.

[00:04:41:27]
CC: Understand; OMNI B Baker.

[00:04:41:59]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:04:42:01]
LMP: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[00:04:42:03]
CC: Roger. About 12 minutes before your big
     blowdown, there is a small continuous vent
     which opens at a GET of 04:55:55. You may
     notice that on the booster, 12- or 15-pound

LMP: Okay.

[00:04:42:25]
CC: And, Apollo 8, could you give us your burn
     information whenever you have it?

[00:04:42:30]
LMP: Roger. We are maneuvering to the attitude now.

[00:04:42:33]
CC: Okay.

[00:04:43:18]
CDR: Okay, Houston. I understand you want 8 feet
     per second burn, is that right?

[00:04:43:21]
CC: Right. Eight feet per second, radially upward.

[00:04:43:33]
CDR: Well, we are as close to being radially upward
     as we can determine.

[00:04:43:36]
_extra : END OF TAPE
CC: Roger.

CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Are you going to use P47 to
     monitor the burn?

CMP: Yes, Jim, that's Roger. We are putting it in
     right now.

CC: Thank you.

_tape : Tape 6
CDR: Maneuvering now.

[00:04:45:06]
CC: Thank you.

[00:04:45:54]
CDR: Houston, we made the burn at 7.7 plus X plus
     00001 Y; and Z's are all zeros. Gimbal angles,
     roll 180, pitch 310, and yaw 020.

[00:04:46:19]
CC: Roger. I copy plus X 7.7. Y 0.1; and roll,
     pitch, and yaw 180, 310, and 20.

[00:04:46:30]
CDR: Did you get that information, Houston?

[00:04:46:33]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. How are you reading?

[00:04:46:36]
CDR: Read you loud and clear. Did you get the information?

[00:04:46:38]
CC: That's affirmative. I say again, we copied
     plus X 7.7, one-tenth in Y, no Z; roll, pitch,
     and yaw, 180, 310, and 020.

[00:04:46:52]
CDR: Roger. The burn was made at - initiated at
     04:45.

[00:04:47:06]
CC: Roger. Copy 04:45 --

[00:04:47:30]
CDR: Okay. Do you want us to transfer that to the
     CS - to the LM state vector or just leave it
     alone? You --

[00:04:47:39]
CC: Affirmative, Frank. We would like you to transfer
     from the CSM to the LM state vector.

CDR: Roger.

[00:04:50:33]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:04:50:35]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[00:04:50:37]
CC: How is that booster looking now? Is it drifting
     away rapidly, or how does it look?

[00:04:50:41]
CDR: Bill is the only one that can see it. Just a
     minute

[00:04:50:45]
LMP: We're 90 degrees from its X-axis, and we must
     be out 1000 feet and moving out.

[00:04:50:53]
CC: Roger. Understand; 90 degrees from its X-axis
     and about 1000 feet and separating.

[00:04:50:59]
LMP: Plus or minus a couple of thousand.

[00:04:51:03]
CC: Understand.

[00:04:51:58]
CDR: Houston, this is Apollo 8. I think we've got
     clearance now; we got a little behind on our
     P23's, but I suggest we go ahead and start those
     now.

[00:04:52:06]
CC: Roger. Stand by.

[00:04:52:38]
CDR: We're well clear of the S-IVB now, Houston.

[00:04:52:40]
CC: Roger, Bill. Thank you, and at your convenience,
     could you give us the PRD reading? And as far
     as the P23 goes, that's just fine to get started
     with it. It looks like your first star, which
     is number 14, should be good until about 05:15 GET.
     Over.

[00:04:53:02]
LMP: Roger. We'll start P23.

[00:04:54:18]
_page : 3
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8 with a PRD reading.

[00:04:54:21]
CC: Go ahead.

[00:04:54:23]
LMP: Roger. At 4 hours 4 minutes, Commander is 0,
     CMP 0.64, LMP 0.02.

[00:04:54:34]
CC: Got that. Copy left to right: 0, 0.64, and
     0.02 at 4 hours and 4 minutes. Thank you.

[00:04:54:43]
LMP: Roger. At 04:53, it was 0.01, 0.64, 0.03, and
     negligible on the survey meter.

[00:04:54:53]
CC: Roger. Thank you.

[00:04:55:12]
CDR: I have a beautiful view of the S-IVB and the
     earth here on one. I'll try and get a picture
     for you.

[00:04:55:18]
CC: Hope so.

[00:04:55:27]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We've got you about a minute
     away from the continuous vent open and 14 minutes
     away from the big dump, and we would like an estimate
     on your distance now if you can give it.

[00:04:55:46]
CDR: Stand by. Our distance is about 3000 feet we
     would estimate.

[00:04:55:50]
CC: Thank you.

[00:04:56:38]
CDR: And we can see the vent.

[00:04:56:44]
CC: Apollo 8. Houston. Say again.

[00:04:56:47]
CDR: We can see the vent.

[00:04:56:49]
CC: Roger. Thank you.

[00:04:58:31]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[00:04:58:33]
CC: Go ahead, Jim.

[00:04:58:35]
_page : 4
CMP: Boy, it's really hard to describe what this earth
     looks like. I'm looking out my center window,
     which is a round window, and the window is bigger
     than the earth is right now. I can clearly see
     the terminator. I can see most of South America,
     all the way up to Central America, Yucatan, and
     the peninsula of Florida. There is a big swirling
     motion just off the east coast, and then going
     on over toward the east, I can still see West
     Africa, which has a few clouds right now. We can
     see all the way down to Cape Horn in South America.

[00:04:59:21]
CC: Good grief, that must be quite a view.

[00:04:59:24]
CDR: Yes. Tell the people in Tierra Del Fuego to put
     on their raincoats; looks like a storm is
     out there.

[00:04:59:31]
CC: Roger. Will do. Do you care to give them a
     24-hour forecast?

[00:04:59:41]
CDR: Probably as good as any other.

[00:05:05:13]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[00:05:05:17]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.

[00:05:05:22]
CDR: Roger. You might be interested to know the center
     window is pretty well fogged up, but the
     other four seem to be in pretty good shape.

[00:05:05:29]
CC: Glad to hear you've got four out of five, and
     your big dump will be coming up in 2 minutes or
     so.

[00:05:05:35]
_page : 5
CDR: Roger. We're standing by.

[00:05:06:48]
CDR: The S-IVB has started dump.

[00:05:07:19]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[00:05:07:20]
CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8.

[00:05:07:22]
CMP: Roger. Mike, did you say star 14 was good till
     about 05:30 or something?

[00:05:07:27]
CC: Yes. Stand by while I give you that time again.
     Star number 14 should be good for about another
     8 minutes, Jim - 7 minutes.

[00:05:07:41]
CMP: Okay. Now be advised, the optics calibration
     is very difficult to do because of all the other
     little stars floating here. I'm going
     to ..., bypass it and do it at the end of this.

[00:05:07:59]
CC: Roger, Apollo 8. Understand.

[00:05:08:10]
CC: You should have the LOX dump now, Apollo 8.

[00:05:08:21]
CMP: Houston, this is 8. I'm looking through the
     scanning telescope and that LOX dump and just
     blanked out completely the entire scanning telescope.

[00:05:08:30]
CC: Understand.

[00:05:08:32]
CDR: It's a fantastic sight, Bill. Looks like the
     S-IVB, a small attitude excursion while it's
     dumping.

[00:05:08:38]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[00:05:11:31]

CMP: Stand by.

[00:05:11:54]

[00:05:11:55]
CC: Okay. We are about 05:10 GET where we will record
     the BLOCK data TLI plus four and TLI
     plus 11. The TLI plus four PAD that we gave you
     before is perfectly all right. We will not require
     that one, and we will have the TLI plus 11
     hour PAD for you shortly, then at 05:45 or 6 hours
     on that high-gain antenna checkout. Roger.
     Standing by.

[00:05:12:28]
CDR: We are on OMNI D, and we heard - we lost you after
     - TM plus four was okay.

[00:05:12:32]
CC: Okay. The TLI plus 4 hour PAD is okay. We will
     have the TLI plus 11 hour PAD for you shortly, and
     at 05:50, for your high-gain antenna checkout, we
     would like you to leave that switch in WIDE BEAM
     with reference to our conversation the other day;
     leave it in WIDE.

[00:05:12:52]
CDR: Roger. Don't want to zap your receivers.

[00:05:12:55]
CC: No, it has to do with some loss of tracking data,
     so it is better to leave it WIDE.

[00:05:13:00]
CDR: Okay.

[00:05:16:41]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8. Are you recording what we are
     getting out of 23?

[00:05:16:44]
_page : 7
CC: Stand by one, Jim; I'll check.

[00:05:17:27]
CC: That is affirmative, Jim; we are copying your
     P23.

[00:05:17:32]
CMP: Pretty big numbers there.

[00:05:17:34]
CC: Well, we think that is because you bypassed the
     trunnion check.

[00:05:17:40]
CMP: Roger.

[00:05:22:18]
CMP: Houston, we are getting some really big numbers
     in DELTA-R and DELTA-V.

[00:05:22:23]
CC: Roger. Understand, Jim.

[00:05:22:25]
CMP: Do you want us to proceed with this, or should
     we just leave them alone?

[00:05:22:32]
CC: Apollo 8, say again.

[00:05:22:34]
CMP: Do you want us to accept these, or should we
     leave them alone?

[00:05:22:37]
CC: Stand by.

[00:05:23:46]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:05:23:49]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[00:05:23:50]
CC: Roger. We do not wish you to accept those marks.
     This is due to the fact that in bypassing the
     trunnion bias check, you still have big numbers
     left in those registers, so you go ahead when -
     after you do the trunnion bias check. Those numbers
     will become small later, but do not accept
     them right now.

[00:05:24:11]
CDR: Understand, Houston.

[00:05:24:13]

[00:05:31:08]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[00:05:31:10]
CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8.

[00:05:31:13]
CMP: Roger, Mike. I'd like to give some comments
     on P23 data. The auto maneuver was quite
     accurate. Looks like we got some substellar
     point in the maneuver; auto optics put Canopus
     straight where it should be; minimum impulse
     control worked as advertised. At the altitudes
     at which I started to do the sightings, they
     have a definite hazy band line. The filter
     gives the earth a glow, sort of an orangey
     glow. It's very indefinite of where to put the
     star, but there does seem to be a solid line
     where you might expect the horizon to be that
     appears through the haze where we expect the
     atmosphere to be. I followed the procedure
     which we had done up at MIT, about two lines
     atop the haze layer a definite line for these
     sightings. In regards to the optics calibration,
     it was very difficult to find a star in
     the landmark line of sight in the venting of
     the S-IVB.

[00:05:32:33]
_page : 10
CC: Roger, Apollo 8. We copied that, and we'd
     like for you to do that trunnion check, that
     calibration, prior to your next set of sightings.

[00:05:32:44]
CMP: Roger. Will do. Canopus just disappeared
     from view, and maybe when we get a little
     time here, I'll try to get a calibration the
     first time.

[00:05:32:56]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[00:05:33:00]
LMP: And, Houston, we've rewound the tape; you can
     dump it at your convenience.

[00:05:33:07]
CC: Roger, Bill. Thank you. Are you still picking
     up anything on the VHF?

[00:05:33:15]
LMP: Are you playing anything?

[00:05:33:17]
CC: Affirmative.

[00:05:33:41]
LMP: No, I'm not picking anything up.

[00:05:33:43]
CC: Roger. Thank you.

[00:05:33:44]
LMP: What's our altitude now?

[00:05:33:50]
_page : 11
CC: Well, you're about 22 000 miles.

[00:05:33:55]
LMP: Okay.

[00:05:33:56]
CC: Give or take a thousand feet.

[00:05:33:59]
LMP: I'll go ahead and turn VHF-A off and high gain.

[00:05:34:03]
CC: Roger, Bill. Thank you.

[00:05:34:06]
LMP: It was some pretty nice music while it lasted.

[00:05:34:09]
CC: Yes, I bet so.

[00:05:35:01]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston,

[00:05:35:04]
CMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[00:05:35:07]
CC: We're going to have to wait until we get the
     high-gain antenna locked on again to dump the
     tape.

[00:05:35:15]
CDR: Okay. And you are about ready for us to go to
     the PTC attitude?

[00:05:35:23]
CC: Stand by one.

[00:05:35:26]
CDR: Okay.

[00:05:35:57]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:05:36:00]
CDR: Go ahead.

[00:05:36:01]
CC: We'd like to hold off on the PTC and get some
     more P23 information. We'll have some more
     details of that for you shortly.

[00:05:36:09]
CDR: Alright.

[00:05:36:10]
CMP: Mike, what I'm doing now, I'm going over to
     the star Sirius ...

[00:05:36:28]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. You faded out completely,
     Jim. I heard Frank, but it faded when you began
     talking. Say again.

[00:05:36:38]
_page : 12
CMP: Roger. I have switched to Sirius, the second
     star in the first set, to see if I can't get
     an optics calibration on it, at least.

[00:05:36:49]
CC: Roger. That's fine. We'll have some more
     good words for you shortly.

[00:05:38:15]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:05:38:18]
CMP: Go ahead.

[00:05:38:19]
CC: Jim, on your P23, we'd like to go ahead and
     do the calibration and then use star number 15
     and take three sets, followed by star number 16,
     two sets. Over.

[00:05:38:38]
CMP: Roger, Houston. That's what we're trying to
     do. I'm trying to get 15 for an optics CAL.
     It's been very difficult with the bright earth
     to find a star that we can get into the sextant.
     I'm trying to use the auto optics in P23 to get
     the star. We have that now; we're trying to
     maneuver the spacecraft to bring the trunnion to
     zero so we can get the landmark line of sight.

[00:05:39:01]
CC: Roger. Understand. And I also have your PTC
     attitude, which is different than you have. I'll
     give that to you whenever you get a free moment.

[00:05:39:16]
CDR: Ready to copy.

[00:05:39:18]
CC: Alright. PTC attitude will be pitch 242; yaw is
     020. Over.

[00:05:39:29]
LMP: pitch 242, yaw 020. Copy.

[00:05:39:33]
_page : 13
CC: Very good; thank you.

[00:05:50:56]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. Over.

[00:05:51:00]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.

[00:05:51:03]
LMP: Roger. We'll hold up on the high-gain check
     until we get out of P23.

[00:05:51:07]
CC: Roger, Bill. Thank you.

[00:05:51:15]
CC: You may have to delay your lunch a little bit.
     Are you hungry?

[00:05:51:19]
LMP: No.

[00:05:51:22]
CC: First time I ever heard you say that.

[00:05:52:11]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:05:52:13]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[00:05:52:14]
CC: Roger. It looks to us like the S-IVB is behaving
     completely normally in regard to all the
     blowdowns and other sequential events that take
     place. It looks good.

[00:05:52:24]
CDR: Roger. How far away is it from us now?

[00:05:52:29]
CC: We were going to ask you.

[00:05:52:31]
CDR: (Laughter) Okay.

[00:05:52:33]
CMP: Fifty miles.

[00:05:52:34]
CC: Roger. Copy.

[00:05:52:41]
CDR: Let's make that 80 kilometers, since there are
     some international aspects to this flight.

[00:05:52:49]
CC: Roger.

[00:05:53:52]
CMP: Okay, Houston. We did an optics calibration;
     we get zeros all the time.

[00:05:53:58]
_page : 14
CC: Roger. Understand; optics calibration and zeros
     all the time. Good.

[00:05:54:03]
CMP: It takes a lot longer to do it, though. I had
     to go to a star like Sirius to finally see it.

[00:05:54:09]
CC: Roger. Understand. We are real glad you got
     that so we can get a horizon calibration to put
     in the computer.

CDR: Looks like the number 5 window is starting to
     fog up, Houston.

[00:05:55:01]
CC: Roger, Houston. Understand it's the number 5
     that is fogging up.

[00:05:55:48]
CMP: Houston, P23 coming through with Sirius.

[00:05:55:53]
CC: Roger. Thank you.

[00:05:55:54]
CMP: A little better, these numbers are a little better.

[00:05:55:57]
CC: We would expect so.

[00:06:07:16]
CDR: Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.

[00:06:07:18]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.

[00:06:07:21]
CDR: Roger. Have you been getting the downlink on
     the P23?

[00:06:07:25]
CC: That is affirmative.

[00:06:07:28]
CDR: Okay. Now how much longer do you want us to
     hold off going to PTC?

[00:06:07:33]
CC: Stand by one, Frank.

[00:06:13:16]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[00:06:13:18]

[00:06:13:24]
_page : 15
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.

[00:06:13:26]
CMP: Roger. Are you recording all of the data from
     23, or do you want some read down to you?

[00:06:13:37]
CC: Stand by, Jim. We think we are getting it all.
     We are confirming now. That is affirmative, Jim.
     We are getting all that is coming down. How is
     it going?

[00:06:13:47]
CMP: It's working very nicely. I finished - one set
     was Sirius, three stars, and one set with Procyon,
     or two sightings; three sightings with
     Sirius and two with Procyon.

[00:06:14:03]
CDR: Okay, Houston. This is Apollo 8. We are ready
     to go to the PTC attitude.

[00:06:14:10]
CC: Roger, Frank. Understand. And we understand
     you've completed all sets, three on one and two
     on another in P23. Is that right?

[00:06:14:16]
CDR: That's affirmative. But we've finished the five
     sightings, three on 15 and two on 16.

[00:06:16:18]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:06:16:20]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[00:06:16:22]
CC: Roger, Frank. What we are doing down here is
     this. We'd really like the horizon calibration.
     We would like a total of 15 marks; you know,
     three sets on one star, two on the other. On
     the other hand, we are balancing that with the
     need to go to PTC, and we are not losing sight
     of the fact that you want to go to PTC right
     away. So if you will bear with us another couple
     of minutes, we are trying to decide whether to
     ask you to go back and do some more of P23 or
     whether to clear you at this time to go to PTC.
     Over.

[00:06:16:50]
_page : 16
CDR: Okay. We started maneuvering to PTC. We are
     getting kind of far behind, and what I am concerned
     about, Mike, Jim is now taking off his
     pressure suit.

[00:06:17:00]
CC: Roger. Understand. How about you and Bill?

[00:06:17:03]
CDR: Well, we are standing by till he gets through.

[00:06:17:04]
CC: Understand. And you are maneuvering to PTC.
     That's fine.

[00:06:17:09]
CDR: Well, I would prefer to do that, but we will --

[00:06:17:14]
_extra: END OF TAPE

CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:06:22:14]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[00:06:22:17]
CC: Roger. We would like to hold off on the
     passive thermal control until 7 hours GET and,
     in the meantime, to get as many more P23 marks
     as we can, starting with the first star and
     doing two sets of three marks each, and then
     going to the second star we gave you. And
     concurrent with that, if possible, we would
     like Bill to run this high-gain antenna checkout
     if Lovell's attitude is compatible with
     that.

[00:06:22:49]
CDR: Okay. But they have not been to date. We
     are almost to the passive thermal control
     attitude now, and Jim is just halfway through
     taking his suit off.

[00:06:22:58]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[00:06:23:01]
CDR: We'll have to hold off for a minute here.

[00:06:23:10]
CC: Roger, Frank. And the reason for this is the
     horizon calibration requires a number of points
     to give you good data for the onboard NAV coming
     on.

[00:06:23:21]
CDR: Roger. We understand. We will be right back
     with you; just have to wait a minute here.

[00:06:23:26]
CC: Roger. Thank you.

[00:06:23:28]
CDR: That failing to separate from the S-IVB kind
     of fouled us up a little.

[00:06:23:32]
_page : 2
CC: Understand.

[00:06:27:21]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?

[00:06:27:24]
CC: Apollo 8. Go ahead.

[00:06:27:27]
CDR: Roger. We are standing by. Are you about
     ready for the high-gain antenna trial?

[00:06:27:33]
CC: Okay. Just a second; we will check on that.
     Then are you in a position where you can go
     back to the star sightings?

[00:06:27:40]
CDR: Well, we will be, but we can't until Jim gets
     ready.

[00:06:27:44]
CC: Okay. We will stand, and you give us a mark
     on that. In just a second, I will check on
     the antenna. Okay. It looks like we are
     ready to go on the high-gain antenna check.
     And we can either go with commands called out
     from the ground, and you can monitor it, or
     you can be talked through it, whichever you
     prefer.

[00:06:28:11]
CDR: Well, stand by. I guess we are not quite in
     a proper attitude yet.

[00:06:28:15]
CC: Roger.

[00:06:28:17]

[00:06:32:52]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[00:06:32:56]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Did you call?

[00:06:32:59]
CDR: Roger. There is the high-gain antenna on
     wide auto.

[00:06:35:26]
CDR: Are you getting the results you want from our
     high-gain antenna?

[00:06:35:45]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Affirmative. We are
     getting your data, and we may have a beam width
     change, but stand by on that.

[00:06:35:53]
CDR: Alright. We're standing by. Jim's about
     ready to go back to the P23.

[00:06:35:57]
CC: Roger. We have a GO until 7 hours on the
     start of the PTC.

[00:06:36:05]
CDR: Roger. Seven.

[00:06:36:54]
CC: Houston, Apollo 8.

[00:06:36:57]
CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8.

[00:06:36:59]
CDR: We're on the PTC mode now waiting for Jim,
     and I noticed that out my window now I can
     see Orion very clearly, even though the sun
     is bright in the other window.

[00:06:37:13]
CC: Roger.

[00:06:37:14]
CDR: It almost pained me to say that, but it's true.

[00:06:37:19]
CC: Roger.

[00:06:37:22]
CDR: Speaking of the windows, the number 5 window
     is getting pretty well obscured and the number
     3 window is unusable.

[00:06:37:29]
CC: Roger. Understand; number 3 is unusable and
     number 5 is obscured. Can you make out any
     definition at all, or do you have a target to
     look at?

[00:06:37:39]
_page : 4
CDR: Well, I can see the sun. Wait till it comes
     around the earth, and I'll give you a better
     hack on that.

[00:06:37:42]
CC: Okay.

[00:06:38:14]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We're going to go ahead
     and try to dump your tape right now. Circuit
     margins aren't too good at our present configuration.
     We're going to take a look at
     it. If it doesn't work, we may have to dump
     it again at a later configuration.

[00:06:38:30]
CDR: Roger.

[00:06:42:57]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8. We're maneuvering back
     now to do another P23.

[00:06:43:02]
CC: Roger. Thank you.

[00:06:43:29]
CMP: Houston, this is Apollo 8. I'll do two more
     sets on 15, and then we'll do one set on 16.

[00:06:43:35]
CC: Roger. Thank you.

[00:06:44:37]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:06:44:40]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[00:06:44:41]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. I'd like to fill you in
     on things we're thinking about doing in the
     next couple of hours, first chance you get
     there.

[00:06:44:51]
CDR: Go ahead.

[00:06:44:52]
_page : 5
CC: Okay. In relationship to the midcourse correction,
     we'd like to put that one off until
     about 11 hours, and it will be approximately
     a 25-foot-per-second burn. The reason we're
     delaying the burn time is to allow for better
     tracking as a result of the 7-1/2-foot per
     second you put in on the separation. We'd
     like to take a little more time to look at
     the tracking data. And the dispersions in your
     correction aren't going to be growing very fast
     here. What we'll do then is to delete the NAV
     sightings that occur about 09 plus 10 in the
     flight plan, and this will be getting us back
     on to the normal flight plan sequence. So
     we'll go ahead and finish the P23, and the
     7-hour limit on that P23 is due to the range
     limits on this test. Over.

[00:06:45:46]
CMP: Is due to the what did you say?

[00:06:45:47]
CC: The 7 hours on the P23 problem is due to the
     fact that we want to get these sightings in
     at a certain range. Over.

[00:06:45:56]
CMP: Roger. Understand.

[00:06:45:59]
CC: If you have any comments on that proposal, why,
     go ahead and pass them down, and we'll feed them
     in.

[00:06:46:06]
CDR: No, I think that's fine. We need to get out of
     the suits and get something to eat here too.

[00:06:46:11]
_page : 6
CC: Roger. Looks like we'll be back on the flight
     plan by 11 hours. We'll be holding up on the
     updates and PAD's because of the later burn.

[00:06:47:35]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[00:06:47:37]
CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8.

[00:06:47:40]
CMP: Roger. I believe we have the S-IVB in sight.
     It would appear to be tumbling, and every once
     in a while, we are getting very bright reflections
     from it off the star, off the sun.

[00:06:47:51]
CC: Roger.

[00:06:50:00]
CMP: Houston, 8. Are you getting the data from the
     P23?

[00:06:50:08]

[00:06:50:12]
CC: Affirmative, Apollo 8.

[00:06:50:13]

CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:07:00:15]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[00:07:00:18]
CC: Roger. We're copying your P23 progress. FAO
     advises that it looks like you are finishing
     your first star, and we'll need one more set
     on the second star, and this 7-hour cut-off
     isn't that firm, so we would like for you
     to go ahead and complete the second star if
     you can.

[00:07:00:39]
CDR: We're on the last setting of the second star
     right now.

[00:07:00:41]
_page : 7
CC: Okay. Real fine. And we've got a - it's about
     time for a cryo fan cycle.

[00:07:00:51]
CDR: Okay. We'll do them one at the time for about
     4 minutes on each of them.

[00:07:00:59]
CC: Roger.

[00:07:01:50]
LMP: We've got the cryo fan on in H<sub>2</sub> tank number 1.

[00:07:01:57]

[00:07:02:03]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8. We've just got finished
     taking two sets, six sightings on Sirius, and
     one set on Procyon.

[00:07:02:17]
CC: Roger. I understand that's six on Sirius and
     one on Procyon.

[00:07:02:23]

[00:07:02:25]

[00:07:02:46]
CC: Oh. Roger, Apollo 8.

[00:07:03:26]
CC: Apollo 8, when you get a chance down in the
     lower equipment bay, it looks like you're
     using the floodlights in the dim 2 position,
     and that one is a time-limited item. We would
     like for you to do your standard running in the
     dim 1 position. Over.

[00:07:03:44]
CDR: Roger. Just turned them off.

[00:07:03:47]
CC: Okay. Anytime you have them on, running dim 1
     position is preferred to the LEB.

[00:07:03:52]
CDR: Thank you.

[00:07:04:39]
_page : 8
LMP: Houston. We have the cryo fan on - the number
     1 H<sub>2</sub> tank was on at 07:01. You can give
     us a hack when you want it - when you're ready
     for it to be turned off.

[00:07:04:50]

[00:07:15:19]
CC: And for your information, it's Cleveland
     24 to 10, and what we plan to do --

[00:07:15:27]
CMP: Say again.

[00:07:15:30]
CC: That's Cleveland 24 to 10, not over yet.

[00:07:15:42]
CDR: Thank you.

[00:07:20:49]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. Looks like you can terminate
     your cryo fans now, and we're going to leave
     you alone for a while and let you get caught
     up. Things we have onboard, the high-gain
     antenna check, COMM mode check that you have
     listed at 7 hours, we'll put off and do whenever
     you are ready for it. So that's at your
     convenience. During the high-gain dump that
     we performed using a wide band, we were still
     getting real good data at 36K, which is a
     little bit further than circuit margins that
     were predicted for you. And we've got our
     SPS burn coming up somewhere around 11 hours,
     and we'll give you more information on that
     later.

[00:07:21:31]
_page : 10

     ground track for LOI that we did not

[00:07:56:58]
CDR: Roger. Do you want us to hold off on this P52
     realignment, also?

[00:07:57:04]
SC: Yes, that is affirmative, CAP COM. We want to
     do that a couple of hours when it is related
     to the maneuver, midcourse.

[00:07:57:10]
CC: That is affirmative, Apollo 8. Let's time the
     maneuver and we will hold off and do that all
     in normal premaneuver sequence. And - We have
     got a score here - in the fourth quarter, 31 to
     13. And I've got some words on your P21 discrepancy
     any time you are interested. And I'd
     like to confirm - -

[00:07:57:30]
CDR: Go ahead.

[00:07:57:33]

     confirm that you used the VERB 37 procedure to go
     to P00.

[00:07:57:41]
CDR: Roger.

[00:07:57:43]
CC: Okay. On P21, the thinking runs that you had a
     slight error in your state vector at the time you
     started, and when that was integrated out, it
     intercepted the lunar surface where it locked up
     and this is contained in a fairly recent program
     note.

[00:07:58:06]
_page : 2
CDR: Okay. Now, we've closed the - the waste vent,
     so we should see this O<sub>2</sub> come down now.

[00:07:58:15]

     and how about the lithium change? Have you done
     that one?

CDR: Roger. With the delay in burn, do you mind if
     we have a urine dump the - before the burn?
     Will that foul your tracking up?

[00:08:13:52]
CC: Okay. Stand by. Let me run that one by.

[00:08:14:53]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We don't have any objections
     to going ahead with the urine dump now. And for
     your information, the waste water dump - our
     schedule, we plan to put it off until about
     11:30, and this will get you up to approximately
     90 percent in your waste tank. It's a little
     higher than normal, but we wanted to put this
     off until after the burn was completed; and
     some of the other things that we've got coming
     up, about 9 hours you have oxygen fuel cell purge;
     and we've already mentioned the deletion of the
     star landmark sightings. From 10 to 11 we have
     put aside for the burn preparations. And a final

CDR: Cleveland won over Dallas, huh?

[00:08:15:43]
CC: How about that?

[00:08:15:49]
CDR: Houston, how do the circuit margins on the
     S-band look as compared to your preflight calculations?

[00:08:16:35]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. It's a little bit early to give
     you any real numbers on your COMM performance.
     Looks like it's working as good as predicted, and
     everything else seems to be doing better, so
     this may be doing better, too, after we have done
     our next COMM checks some of these other things
     will have a better hack on; I can give you a
     quantitative answer to your question.

[00:08:16:56]
CDR: Roger.

[00:08:24:23]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?

[00:08:24:26]
CC: Loud and clear, Apollo 8.

[00:08:24:29]
LMP: Roger. Sure got a nice view of the earth from
     here. We can see Baja California and about where
     San Diego ought to be.

[00:08:24:40]
_page : 4
CC: Very good.

[00:08:24:44]
LMP: I can't see my dad's flagpole out there today,
     though.

[00:08:24:48]
CC: We'll tell the doctors about that.

[00:08:48:40]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:08:48:43]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[00:08:48:45]
CC: Okay. We dropped off of high gain on the OMNI
     there for a bit and went to a low bit rate, and
     we're getting ready to command you back to a
     high bit rate. Do you want us to keep you posted
     every time we change tape speeds?

[00:08:49:05]
CDR: We're not recording now anyway, Houston.

[00:08:49:08]
CC: Roger. Understand; but when we go to high bit
     rate, do you want to be kept informed every time
     we transfer? We hadn't planned on it.

[00:08:49:20]
CMP: If we think it we need the recorder, we'll ask you
     on that deal.

[00:08:49:24]
CC: Okay.

[00:09:09:34]
CDR: Apollo 8.

[00:09:09:37]
CC: Go ahead.

[00:09:09:40]
CDR: Roger. How does your tracking look on us?

[00:09:09:44]
F: Fido, FLIGHT.

[00:09:10:13]
CC: Apollo 8, tracking still in progress and a
     little too soon to give you a firm answer on the
     results, but everything looks nominal so far.

[00:09:10:26]
LMP: Is it working okay?

[00:09:10:28]
_page : 5
CC: Seems to be.

[00:09:12:05]
CC: Apollo 8.

[00:09:12:07]
LMP: Go ahead.

[00:09:12:09]
CC: Okay. Sometime when it's convenient for you
     now, I would like to see an oxygen fuel cell
     purge. And do you have any estimate on when
     you might be getting around to this COMM test?

[00:09:12:24]
LMP: Right now we're right in the middle of trying to
     get something to eat, Ken. We can - I guess we
     can do the fuel cell purge.

[00:09:12:36]
CC: Apollo 8, there's no rush. Just didn't know
     what you were doing at the time and - Give us
     a call when you have a free moment; we'll pick
     up.

[00:09:12:50]
LMP: We can start the O<sub>2</sub> purge now, if you wish.

[00:09:12:57]
CC: Okay. That'd be fine, and I'll keep track of
     the time for you.

[00:09:13:00]
LMP: Okay. That'd be good. Now I'll turn on O<sub>2</sub> now
     on fuel cell 1.

[00:09:13:05]
CC: Okay. Thank you.

[00:09:15:41]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. That's about 2 minutes on your
     first fuel cell.

[00:09:15:47]
CDR: Roger. It's up, and number 2 is on now.

[00:09:15:50]
CC: Roger.

[00:09:17:31]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[00:09:17:33]
CC: Houston. Go ahead.

[00:09:17:35]
_page : 6
CMP: While I'm waiting for my turn at the water gun,
     I might give some comments on the optics. There
     seems to be quite a band of light that goes all
     way across the scanning telescope anywhere in the
     vicinity of the sun. Just a little while ago we
     were in the position where I could pick up the
     moon in the scanning telescope. And then I looked
     at it in the sextant and the sky - the space around
     the moon was a very light blue, just about as
     light blue as we have it back on earth. And
     it's not black - that sun angle with the moon.

[00:09:18:20]
CC: Understand. This light blue was - showed up in
     the sextant.

[00:09:18:25]
CMP: That's affirmative. I maneuvered the optics so
     I could pick up the moon in the sextant, and the -
     the space around the moon is light blue.

[00:09:18:37]
CC: Roger. Can you make any kind of estimate about
     the proportion of the radius, how far out that
     seems to extend?

[00:09:18:46]
CMP: Well, it extends the full length of the sextant.
     Actually, I could see us coming as we moved across,
     because the band of light in the scanning telescope
     cut across where the moon was, and it moved
     in this area. I believe it's caused by the refractional
     light inside the optics themselves.

[00:09:19:05]
CC: Roger.

[00:09:19:09]
_page : 7
CMP: Also, I've been occasionally looking out to
     see if I could see stars at various sun angles,
     and at this particular altitude, it's very difficult.
     In the scanning telescope the sun is
     very bright and the earth is very bright, And
     if I looked at the earth and try to look for stars,
     I lose my dark adaptation very quickly.

[00:09:19:35]
CC: Roger. Do you have any problems seeing the moon?

[00:09:19:41]
CMP: No problem seeing the moon. When I looked for the
     star landmark line of sight, I - It's a very thin
     crescent, but it was very visible.

[00:09:19:53]
CC: Roger. Does the area illuminated in earthshine
     show up?

[00:09:20:00]
CMP: Not at this altitude, and that's strange. I
     thought I could see that. At this altitude, the
     refraction of the light in the optics themselves,
     due to the reflection of the sunlight I suspect,
     or earth's light, completely blanked out the dark
     side of the moon to this altitude.

[00:09:20:17]
CC: How about that.

[00:09:20:23]
CDR: Maybe we have an atmosphere around the moon.

[00:09:21:11]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. Looks like that ought to terminate
     the fuel cell purging.

[00:09:21:16]

_page : 1
_tape : Tape 9
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[00:09:44:45]
CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8.

[00:09:44:47]
CDR: Do you want to get started here around 10 hours?
     Is that what you said?

[00:09:44:54]
CC: Well, what we had planned was to use the 10- to
     11-hour period as your preburn preparation just
     as we would have done normally, and - -

[00:09:45:04]
CDR: That's fine. We can go ahead and do that.

[00:09:45:13]
CC: - - and if you can work in this COMM check
     before that, it would be desirable, but that's
     not a constraint.

[00:09:45:20]
CDR: What do you want in the way of a COMM check,
     George?

[00:09:45:27]
CDR: Again, what do you want?

[00:09:45:29]
CC: Okay. What we've got here is a couple of DTO
     COMM checks. We'll be switching around to five
     different modes, and only one of them will
     interrupt your activities. In that case, we'll
     be switching to the uplink backup voice, and
     that's the one time that you might lose temporary
     uplink voice COMM. You'll have downlink voice
     COMM throughout the entire procedure, and it ought
     to take you, I guess, 10 to 15 minutes MAX, the
     only requirement being that we should stay on a
     high-gain antenna.

[00:09:46:05]
CDR: Why don't we go ahead and start now then?

[00:09:46:07]
_page : 2
CC: Okay. That sounds pretty good.

[00:09:46:08]
CDR: - whenever -

[00:09:47:20]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. Another couple of minutes
     and we'll be ready to go into our - our COMM
     check. And, for your information, looks like
     the signal strength is 3 to 4 dB better than
     expected on the wide range, on the WIDE BEAM
     mode, and approximately that gives you 1.4 increase
     in your range.

[00:09:47:46]
CDR: Roger. Let's not increase it by 1.4 more,
     though.

[00:09:47:50]
CC: Okay.

[00:09:48:08]
CC: Something else you might take a look at: as
     you go through the PTC, we have some who would
     like to know if you can see any detectable
     effect on the windows in the form of their
     fogging. Particularly, does the sun seem to
     vary fog intensity or does it increase it or
     decrease it or make it go in patches or anything
     like that that you might be able to notice?

[00:09:48:40]
CDR: The sun doesn't seem to change it much; however,
     the different incidences of the sun's rays
     magnify the - the fogging, or at least change it.

[00:09:49:04]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. I'm sorry. Would you say again,
     please?

[00:09:49:08]
CDR: The sun doesn't stem to have any effect on the
     windows themselves, but the different inci -
     angles of incidence of the sun rays change the
     relative amount of obscuration caused by the
     fogging.

[00:09:49:24]
_page : 3
CC: Okay.

[00:09:50:05]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. We're ready to go into the
     COMM check now, and it's your option. We can
     call out switches and let you position them,
     or we can command it from the ground. In either
     event, there will be a couple of switches that
     you'll have to throw for us.

[00:09:50:24]
CDR: We'll have to command them, and we'll throw
     what we have - what you want.

[00:09:50:29]
CC: Okay. And I'll keep you posted on what we're
     doing. The first test is an uplink voice and
     ranging with full downlink which is essentially
     what you're doing right now, is to be used for
     a baseline.

[00:09:50:44]
CDR: Roger.

[00:09:51:12]
CC: Okay. We're starting on test number 1, and
     if you would verify that S-band NORMAL mode
     switch is in VOICE.

[00:09:51:22]
CDR: Roger. We're in VOICE.

[00:09:51:24]
CC: Okay.

[00:09:51:25]
CDR: ... Charlie.

[00:09:51:31]
CC: And the up-telemetry DATA to DATA.

[00:09:51:36]
CDR: Roger. DATA.

[00:09:51:49]
_page : 4
CC: Okay. And up-telemetry COMMAND to NORMAL.

[00:09:51:55]
CDR: Normal.

[00:09:51:57]
CC: Roger. How about high-gain antenna track to
     AUTO?

[00:09:52:01]
CDR: We're on OMNI D now; we've got to wait till we
     get around the other way.

[00:09:52:10]
CC: Okay. What's your estimate?

[00:09:52:19]
CDR: We're at 15 minutes from it.

[00:09:52:25]
CC: Okay.

[00:09:52:34]
CDR: Maybe we'd better hold the COMM check till after
     the midcourse, because we'd better get fired
     here at 10 if we want to burn at 9.

[00:09:52:43]
CC: That's affirm. We're viewing that right now.

[00:09:52:47]
CDR: ... means we're on two vertical level.

[00:09:52:55]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. We're postponing the COMM test
     until after the burn.

[00:09:53:02]
CDR: Thank you.

[00:09:54:20]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8. Are you ready to go - for
     us to go through with the P52 now?

[00:09:54:35]
CC: That's negative, Apollo 8. We would like to update
     things first, and we're going to give you a LM
     state vector and then an external DELTA-V.

[00:09:54:43]
CDR: Roger.

[00:09:54:44]
CC: And with P00 in ACCEPT while we'll go ahead and
     work on that.

[00:09:57:22]
CC: Okay. We've got your PAD's. We're ready to
     read up to you, And we're standing by to uplink
     your state vector and external DELTA-V whenever
     you're ready to give us ACCEPT.

[00:09:57:36]
CDR: Roger. Just stand by one, and we will get the
     PAD from you.

[00:09:57:48]
CDR: And we will put in - TM in ACCEPT now - at this
     time.

[00:09:57:53]
CC: Roger.

[00:09:58:10]
CDR: We're ready to copy the PAD.

[00:09:58:21]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. I didn't copy that last one.
     We are sending you state vector up now.

[00:09:58:26]

     been able to see any stars through the scanning
     telescope yet.

[00:10:09:30]

[00:10:09:40]
CC: Okay. And another comment for you, Apollo 8;
     like for you to use VERB 37 to select P00 and
     then wait for your computer activity light to
     go off prior to unzap of the LM NAV to CSM SLA.

[00:10:09:55]

[00:10:11:03]
CC: Go ahead.

[00:10:11:05]
CDR: Okay. Now we'll go ahead and start back towards
     the flight plan around 8 hours here of P52, right?

[00:10:11:14]
CC: That's affirm.

[00:10:11:19]
CDR: Well, we - we have transferred - wait - we've
     transferred the state vector to the LM SLA
     already before we did a 52. So we're going to
     do the 52 now.

[00:10:11:43]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. That's good procedure and -

[00:10:16:13]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:10:16:16]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[00:10:16:18]

     to BLOCK, please?

[00:10:16:24]
CDR: Thank you. It's in BLOCK.

[00:10:29:24]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:10:29:27]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[00:10:29:30]
CC: Okay. We've got a telescope alignment if you'd
     like to give it a try. Your sextant star is
     still good, but if you had problems with that,
     folks have worked out that if you look through
     the telescope at 10:35, we have a shaft and
     trunnion that should point you at the center
     of the earth, if you would like to give that one
     a try.

[00:10:29:52]
_page : 9

[00:10:29:55]

[00:10:32:34]
CC: Okay. We'd like to get a fan - a cryo fan cycle
     in here before the burn. About 1 minute on each
     should be fine.

[00:10:32:44]
LMP: Roger. I've already given 2 minutes on H<sub>2</sub> 1
     and 2 and O<sub>2</sub> 1, and I've just started O<sub>2</sub> 2.

[00:10:32:52]
CC: Roger. Thank you.

[00:10:34:17]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We'd like to dump your tape
     prior to the burn.

[00:10:34:26]
LMP: Roger. It's only been running here about 15 minutes.

[00:10:34:43]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. That's - that's correct. You're
     on high bit rate, and we're afraid you may run
     out before the burn, so we'd like to dump it,
     and give it back to you with a full load before
     the burn.

[00:10:35:00]
LMP: Roger. And give us a comment on the voice quality.

[00:10:35:04]
CC: Wilco.

[00:10:36:49]
_page : 10
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[00:10:36:51]
CC: Go ahead.

[00:10:36:54]
LMP: Roger. We plan to stop charging battery B
     about another 5 minutes. You concur?

[00:10:37:05]
CC: That's affirmative.

[00:10:37:07]
LMP: Okay. You might just remind us.

[00:10:37:10]
CC: Wilco.

[00:10:43:08]
CC: Apollo 8.

[00:10:43:12]
CDR: This is 8. Go ahead.

[00:10:43:20]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. You were cut out.

[00:10:43:22]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. All your systems are GO, and
     we were about to tell you you can go ahead and
     terminate the battery charge, and you beat us to
     the punch.

[00:10:43:35]
CDR: I read your mind, and it's showing 37 volts right
     now.

[00:10:43:40]
CC: Okay.

[00:10:53:57]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. If you'll go high bit rate,
     we'll give you a tape recorder back to your
     command.

[00:10:54:43]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. If you'll put your high bit
     rate on, we'll give you a tape recorder back.

[00:10:54:49]
CDR: Roger.

[00:10:56:50]
CDR: Houston, did you give us a tape back? Over.

[00:10:57:06]
CC: Affirmative, Apollo 8.

[00:10:57:09]
CDR: Apollo 8's COMMAND RESET to get tape motion,
     we're now in NORMAL.

[00:10:57:20]
_page : 11
CC: Roger.

[00:10:58:42]
CC: Apollo 8, stand by for a mark at 1 minute.

[00:10:58:48]
CDR: Roger. Apollo 8 standing by.

[00:10:58:49]
CC: Ten seconds.

[00:10:58:54]
CC: Five seconds.

[00:10:58:57]
CC: 2, 1 -

[00:10:58:59]
CC: MARK.

[00:10:59:00]
CC: One minute.

[00:10:59:01]
CDR: Roger.

[00:11:02:43]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[00:11:02:45]
CC: Go ahead.

[00:11:02:48]
CDR: Roger. The burn time was on time - about
     2 seconds; we have residual 4.4 X. We burned
     it out to 0.2. Attitudes are nominal. The
     DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> before the residuals were taken out
     was a minus 2.4. I have transferred the state
     vector to the LM's slot in VERB 66.

[00:11:03:14]
CC: Roger. Copy 4.4 for X and 2.4 on Z. And negative
     residual on Y prior to the trim. Is that
     affirm?

[00:11:03:24]
CDR: That's affirmative, and we took out the 4.4 residual
     down to 0.2.

[00:11:03:29]
CC: Roger.

[00:11:04:13]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. Do you want us to start
     charging battery A, now?

[00:11:04:20]
CC: Standby.

[00:11:04:35]
_page : 12
CC: Apollo 8. Let's go back to battery Bravo, and
     we'll finish that one off before we start in on
     Alfa.

[00:11:04:43]
LMP: Roger. Battery Bravo.

[00:11:04:52]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8. Do you want us to maneuver
     to any particular attitude for a water dump, or
     do you want us to go to PTC attitude?

[00:11:05:02]
CC: Okay. Let's go PTC.

[00:11:05:04]
_extra: END OF TAPE
CDR: And give us the angles, please.

CC: Okay, Apollo 8. Let's do the same angles
     we had before: that's pitch 242 and yaw 20
     on the PTC attitude.

[00:11:05:40]
_page : 1
_tape : Tape 10
CMP: 242, yaw 20. Roger.

[00:11:07:50]
CMP: Houston, we're preparing to dump our waste
     water now.

[00:11:07:54]
CC: Roger.

[00:11:10:41]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[00:11:10:44]
CC: Go ahead, 8.

[00:11:10:47]
CDR: We noticed on our system test battery vent
     pressure that when we opened the battery vent
     valve, we get an immediate drop-off to pressure
     which nulls out at about two-tenths of 2 - to
     three-tenths of a volt. And we think this is
     zero at the battery manifold. Do you concur?

[00:11:11:08]
CC: Okay. Stand by. ... stand by one, and let's
     check it out.

[00:11:11:17]
CC: Apollo 8, I cut you out there. What did you say
     on the last one?

[00:11:11:22]
CDR: It looks like probably that zero psi corresponds
     to about three-tenths of a volt on the test meter.
     We've had it happen a couple of times, where
     the pressure would drop rapidly to this setting,
     as if it were zero. Over.

[00:11:11:37]
CC: Roger. We'll look at our data here and let you
     know what we see. Are you going ahead with the
     water dump now?

[00:11:11:49]
_page : 2
CDR: Roger. We'd - we're pausing here on the water
     dump, though, just to verify that the battery
     vent - the line is clear as indicated by a
     battery vent pressure of zero.

[00:11:12:03]
CC: Okay. Stand by.

[00:11:20:10]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:11:20:13]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[00:11:20:15]
CC: Okay. Number one on the list of things is that
     the flight plan shows CDR should hit the sack.
     Number two, kind of a summary of your burn. All
     your SPS and systems look GO. The trajectory
     shows that you have a CPA with a mode of 69.67 miles
     and the time of pericynthion is 69 plus 10. You
     do have a capture on a good free return. It's
     a little bit early to completely evaluate the
     trajectory for corridor control. You'll have no
     update to the TLI plus 11 block data. After looking
     through the CAL curves, it looks like the battery-vent
     pressure is actually zero at 0.2 to 0.3 volts,
     so that - we agree with you there, and you can go
     ahead with the water dump. We still have the
     COMM check to do whenever we get ourselves in a
     good high gain look angle and whenever it's convenient
     for you. Over.

[00:11:21:26]
CDR: Thank you very much. That was a very fine resume
     you sent in. We're right now in the process of
     trying to dump out the water and the UCDA's and
     so on and so on. So we'll get with you on the
     high gain as soon as we can.

[00:11:21:41]
_page : 3
CC: Okay. Good burn.

[00:11:21:44]
CDR: Houston, what do you want to dump the waste tank
     down to?

[00:11:22:01]
CC: Apollo 8, I would like you to dump the waste tank
     to 25 percent.

[00:11:22:08]
CDR: Okay.

[00:11:27:07]
LMP: Hey, we're dumping now, Houston.

[00:11:27:09]
CC: Okay. Thank you.

[00:11:27:12]
LMP: We finally got some stars to see.

[00:11:32:00]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:11:32:03]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[00:11:32:05]
CC: Roger. Do you folks have your WATER QUANTITY
     switch in the POTABLE or the WASTE WATER TANK
     position now?

[00:11:32:14]
CDR: We're in the WASTE TANK position now, and we're
     dumping UCDA's first, Houston.

[00:11:32:20]
CC: Okay. We weren't watching any waste quantity
     decrease, and it looked like the nozzle temps
     indicated that something was going on, and we
     were trying to dope out what was going on.

[00:11:32:30]
CDR: Well, there's a lot of stuff going out I'll tell
     you. How do nozzle temps look?

[00:11:32:41]
_page : 4
CC: Oh, about 81.

[00:11:32:44]
CDR: Okay. We'll keep on going then.

[00:11:40:37]
LMP: Okay, Houston. We're going to dump the waste
     tank on down to about 25 percent.

[00:11:40:44]
CC: Okay. Thank you.

[00:11:40:57]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. Do you copy?

[00:11:40:59]
CC: Affirmative, Apollo 8.

[00:11:41:02]
LMP: Okay. Tell Zeke Thomas to wake up and keep an
     eye on the waste tank servicing.

[00:11:41:16]
CC: It'll take a minute to think of something appropriate.

[00:11:41:23]
LMP: You're slowing down.

[00:11:41:28]
CC: So are you guys.

[00:11:46:53]
LMP: How are the nozzle temperatures looking, Houston?

[00:11:46:59]
CC: Stand by.

[00:11:49:16]
LMP: Man, you're looking pretty small down there now,
     Houston.

[00:11:49:24]
CC: We're carrying a big stick, though.

[00:11:49:30]
LMP: Just barely make out Clear Lake.

[00:11:49:40]
CC: Your nozzle temperatures have dropped from about
     94 to around 66.

[00:11:49:49]
LMP: Okay. I'm showing just a little bit above 50 percent
     here, and we'll keep on going, and if it looks
     too cold, give us a call.

[00:11:49:59]
CC: Okay. We'll do that.

[00:11:50:30]
_page : 5
LMP: Houston, we had a momentary O<sub>2</sub> high flow, but
     we think it's due to all the purging of the water
     lines we're doing here in the cabin.

[00:11:50:40]
CC: Roger. We concur.

[00:11:53:20]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We show you down to 25 percent
     of your waste water.

[00:11:53:26]
LMP: Okay. I'm just about 28, Houston. Stand by just
     a bit.

[00:11:54:02]
LMP: Okay. Waste dump stopped and then purge again.

[00:11:54:05]
CC: Understand. Roger. Waste dump stopped.

[00:11:54:08]
LMP: Roger.

[00:11:59:50]
LMP: Houston, we're on a high gain, and it might be
     a good time to try your COMM check.

[00:12:00:59]
CC: Apollo 8, we're going to go ahead and crank up
     to a COMM test now, and we will be a little bit
     late on your update for 12 hours.

[00:12:01:10]
LMP: Okay.

[00:12:01:11]
CC: Do you still want our - have us command as much
     as we can on the ground, or would you like to move
     the switches yourself?

[00:12:01:20]
LMP: Oh, you can have the fun of doing it.

[00:12:01:23]
CC: Sounds like you're dragging there.

[00:12:01:30]
LMP: ... you suggest a ... We're using 1/250 on at
     f:11 on CEX and CMAX for earth shots. Do you
     verify? Over.

[00:12:01:43]
CC: Okay. You got going before I got my pencil up.
     How about saying it again?

[00:12:01:49]
_page : 6
LMP: f:11 and 1/250 for CEX 16mm and C 70mm.

[00:12:01:58]
CC: Okay. Thank you.

[00:12:02:01]
LMP: How about running in by the back room boys. My
     light meter doesn't seem to be helping out too
     much.

[00:12:02:07]
CC: Okay.

[00:12:03:01]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. We're starting in - setting up
     for our first COMM test. This is going to be an
     uplink voice, ranging, and full downlink, which
     is not anything really different than what you
     have on board. I would like for you to verify
     that the S-band NORMAL MODE VOICE switch is in
     VOICE.

[00:12:03:22]
LMP: Roger. VOICE.

[00:12:03:24]
CC: Okay. And the up-telemetry DATA to DATA.

[00:12:03:28]
LMP: Roger. DATA.

[00:12:03:33]
CC: Up-telemetry COMMAND in NORMAL.

[00:12:03:36]
LMP: Roger. NORMAL.

[00:12:03:38]
CC: High-gain antenna to AUTO TRACK.

[00:12:03:42]
CC: Correction. That's -

[00:12:03:43]
LMP: AUTO.

[00:12:03:46]
LMP: We're in AUTO WIDE BEAM, and you can go ahead and
     dump the tape.

[00:12:03:50]
CC: Okay. I'd like for you to go to NARROW BEAM.

[00:12:03:54]
LMP: Okay. Going to NARROW BEAM now.

[00:12:03:57]
CC: Roger.

[00:12:04:01]
_page : 7
CC: And I'll give you a call when we get ready to
     work on the tape.

[00:12:04:05]
LMP: Okay. We're still in PTC, so you're only going
     to have it for about 10 or 15 minutes.

[00:12:04:12]
CC: Okay. We've had some problems with our displays,
     and I think they're straightened out now, but
     you may have to keep us advised if we run out of
     limits in case we display again.

[00:12:04:22]
LMP: Roger.

[00:12:04:38]
CC: Say, while we're standing by here, Apollo 8,
     the service module quantities that we had listed -
     we're going to try to update them, if you want
     to call out your quantities. Have you checked them
     with your charts?

[00:12:04:54]
LMP: Negative. I haven't gotten around to that. Stand
     by.

[00:12:04:56]
CC: Okay. There's no hurry on that. Just wondered
     if you had done it; we will check it against what
     we've got on our norma-gram.

[00:12:05:17]
LMP: I'm showing a SPS helium pressure, about 3570,
     indicated on board.

[00:12:05:29]
CC: Roger.

[00:12:05:31]
LMP: And fuel LOX tank pressures are 177 and 176,
     respectively.

[00:12:05:40]
CC: Okay.

[00:12:05:44]
LMP: N<sub>2</sub> A is 2400, B 2500.

[00:12:05:52]
CC: Okay.

[00:12:06:12]
_page : 8
CC: Okay. And our back room tells you that you've
     got the right F stop.

[00:12:06:19]
LMP: Okay. Then we'll keep using it.

[00:12:06:27]
LMP: This PTC attitude really isn't the greatest for
     taking pictures of the earth.

[00:12:06:32]
CC: Roger.

[00:12:06:34]
LMP: Or of the moon.

[00:12:06:46]
CC: Apollo 8, kinda stand by for a burst of noise
     as we change configurations on the ground. We're
     going into test 1; You'll still have up and
     downlink, and we'll be in this mode for 2 minutes,
     but you may hear some burst of noise as we change.

[00:12:07:03]
LMP: Roger.

[00:12:08:46]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. We're in the middle of our first
     test, and how about giving me a voice check.

[00:12:08:53]
LMP: Roger, Houston. This is Apollo 8. One, two,
     three, four, five, five, four, three, two, one.
     Apollo 8, out.

[00:12:08:59]
CC: Roger. And read you loud and clear. This COMM
     is unbelievably good.

[00:12:09:05]
LMP: Good.

[00:12:10:21]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. We've finished the first test,
     and we're now going to change the uplink mode
     to UPLINK COMMAND AND RANGING, and we'll be
     going without upvoice. We'll be in this mode
     for 2-1/2 minutes and will be sending a test
     messages. It'll have no effect on either your
     computer or your panel switch configuration.
     What you might see will be the S-band noise that's
     associated with the break lock. However, you
     should still have a good signal on your power
     meter. This is not a loss of signal, but rather
     just a loss of the voice modulation, and I'll
     do you a mark just before we do that so that you
     can turn your S-band volume down if you so desire,
     and we'll be back up in this mode that we're in
     now in 2-1/2 minutes.

[00:12:11:13]
_page : 9
LMP: Roger.

[00:12:11:31]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We're about to disable the
     voice modulation on uplink, and we'll be back up
     no later than 12:31.

[00:12:14:26]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Voice check.

[00:12:14:29]
LMP: Read you five-by, Houston.

[00:12:14:37]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:12:14:40]
LMP: Roger, Houston. Read you loud and clear and am
     with you. Completed our second test.

[00:12:14:47]
LMP: Okay.

[00:12:14:57]
CC: Okay. Our next test will be a test of the uplink
     voice and ranging with downlink voice and ranging
     and on low bit rate, so we'll be changing bit
     rate on you, and we'll be making a voice check
     in the middle.

[00:12:15:12]
_page : 10
LMP: Okay. You've about had it on the high gain.
     You might try to get it in, but it's going to
     hit the scan limit at any second.

[00:12:15:28]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. Looks like we'll get our information
     before we lose the high gain.

[00:12:15:34]
LMP: Okay. We'll just leave it go.

[00:12:15:36]
CC: Roger.

[00:12:16:21]
LMP: They got the scan limit. We'll let it go,
     Houston, until it breaks lock.

[00:12:16:33]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. Go ahead and switch to the OMNI.

[00:12:16:38]
LMP: How're you doing with your test?

[00:12:16:40]
CC: Okay. We've got three-fifths of the test. We'll
     have to pick up the rest next time we get a look
     at high gain.

[00:12:16:47]
LMP: Okay.

[00:12:26:56]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[00:12:26:59]
CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8.

[00:12:27:01]
CMP: Roger. Reading on P21 at 269 10 indicates a
     parallel of about 67.4 miles. I guess we can
     carry her.

[00:12:27:12]
CC: You guys are getting pretty good.

[00:12:27:16]
CMP: That's a lot better than our first answer.

[00:12:27:23]
LMP: We don't care if we're right, just so MPAD
     is right.

[00:12:38:20]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[00:12:38:23]
CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8.

[00:12:38:26]
_page : 11
CMP: Roger. I'd like to ask a question about this
     TLI plus 11 maneuver that we copied. In the
     remarks, you put P37, DELTA-V 7900. Is this
     the DELTA-V that we would use with P37?

[00:12:38:43]
CC: Okay. That's the option that you use with minimum
     time.

[00:12:38:51]
_extra : END OF TAPE
CMP: Roger. What I'd like to do is check on our P37
     with your TLI maneuver update.

CC: Okay, Apollo 8. We'd like to make sure that
     we don't have a misunderstanding that this
     7900 feet per second is the DELTA-V. It's not
     associated with the high speed per feet work
     around procedure. This is just a standard P37
     DELTA-V.

[00:12:40:22]
_page : 1
_tape : Tape 11
LMP: Roger. But was that the DELTA-V that you used
     to give us the TLI plus 11? Okay.

[00:12:40:32]
CC: Okay. That's not the one that the maneuver PAD
     was based on. That's the number you put in for
     the minimum time.

[00:12:40:44]
LMP: Roger. Understand.

[00:12:40:46]
CC: Okay. Sounds like a good idea if you want to
     go ahead and check out the 37. And we're
     standing by to work on COMM as soon as that high
     gain is available.

[00:12:40:54]
LMP: Roger.

[00:12:44:54]
LMP: Okay. Houston, you got the high gain.

[00:12:46:03]
LMP: Houston, do you read? Apollo 8. Over.

[00:12:46:22]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:12:46:25]
LMP: Roger. High gain yours.

[00:12:46:29]
CC: Okay. And if you're ready, we are. We'll go
     right ahead with our COMM checks.

[00:12:46:34]
LMP: Go ahead.

[00:12:46:40]
CC: We're starting in now on our fourth test. Like
     for you to put your TELEMETRY INPUT switch to
     PCM HIGH.

[00:12:46:59]
_page : 2
LMP: It's in HIGH.

[00:12:47:01]
CC: Okay. And now we're going to switch uplink to
     the upvoice backup for about 2 minutes, and it may
     take a couple of seconds when you hear the upvoice
     lost. So you can place your up-telemetry switch
     to upvoice backup, and in the event that all of
     this doesn't work out too well, I'm reading 12:47
     on my clock now, and let's meet back in our present
     configuration no later than 12:50.

[00:12:47:33]
LMP: Roger. On upvoice backup.

[00:12:47:35]
CC: Okay. Thank you.

[00:12:48:16]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:12:48:20]
LMP: Roger, Houston. Read you loud and clear.

[00:12:48:22]
CC: That's pretty good. That's upvoice backup,
     and will you confirm that you're in NARROW BEAM on
     high gain?

[00:12:48:31]
LMP: Roger. NARROW BEAM.

[00:12:48:33]
CC: Okay. Thank you. We're going to continue tracking
     and watching high-gain antenna for a couple of
     minutes. Then I'll give you a call when we're
     ready to go back.

[00:12:48:50]
LMP: Roger.

[00:12:50:03]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We have completed this test.
     We'll be switching back to full uplink. When you
     hear the noise associated with the loss of modulation,
     you can go back from the up-telemetry switch
     to DATA.

[00:12:50:16]
_page : 3
LMP: Thank you.

[00:12:50:51]
LMP: All the way.

[00:12:50:52]
CC: Okay. Loud and clear.

[00:12:50:59]
LMP: How's everything looking down there?

[00:12:51:01]
CC: Real fine. We've just got one to go here if
     you'll put your telemetry input PCM switch to LOW.

[00:12:51:09]
LMP: Roger. Go in LOW.

[00:12:51:12]
CC: Okay. We'll be in that configuration for about
     2 minutes, and then we'll be completed with the
     COMM test.

[00:12:51:19]
LMP: Roger.

[00:12:51:20]
CC: I have some service module RCS quantities if you
     would like to take them sometime and check them
     against your onboard calculations.

[00:12:51:31]
LMP: Stand by.

[00:12:52:20]
LMP: Roger. Ready to copy. Could you give quad A,
     B, C, and D in that order?

[00:12:52:24]
CC: Okay. Will do. And I'll give you weights in
     pounds and percentages. Quad A 231 for 76 percent.

[00:12:52:31]
LMP: Roger. Stand by. What time is that for?

[00:12:52:41]
CC: Oh, 12 plus 15.

[00:12:53:06]
LMP: Okay. Got it.

[00:12:53:08]
CC: Okay. Quad Bravo 251, 82 percent. Quad Charlie
     240, 79 percent.

[00:12:53:20]
LMP: Slow down.

[00:12:53:29]
_page : 4
CC: Quad Delta 245, 81 percent. P and C advises
     that these numbers are still good even though it
     is a 12:15 time. And we are completed with the
     COMM test. You can take your high-gain antenna
     and go back to MEDIUM.

[00:12:53:57]
LMP: Roger. MEDIUM.

[00:12:54:36]
CC: Apollo 8, we would like to dump your tape again,
     if you are not using it. And the reason we want
     to do this is we have some - we didn't completely
     get dumped before the burn. We would like to get
     that and get the rest of the burn data. There is
     no hurry on it. We can do it whenever it is convenient
     for you.

[00:12:54:54]
LMP: You got it.

[00:12:54:57]
CC: Okay. Thank you.

[00:12:56:18]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Do you call?

[00:12:56:22]
LMP: Negative, negative. Negative, Houston.

[00:12:56:26]
CC: Okay. Thank you. Say, we're curious about what
     you did with your Mae West?

[00:12:56:52]
LMP: We thought we might bleed the CO<sub>2</sub> out into the
     vacuum connector here in our next water dump. We
     forgot it the last time. Did you copy?

[00:12:57:10]
CC: Roger, Doesn't seem like there is any problem
     with going ahead and dumping it in the cockpit
     if you like.

[00:12:57:37]
LMP: It is CO<sub>2</sub>, isn't it?

[00:12:57:39]
_page : 5
CC: That's affirm.

[00:12:58:15]
CC: Apollo
     8, Houston. We asked it again, and it
     looks like no problems at all with going ahead
     and bleeding it down in the cockpit. And then
     if you need it again on entry or after entry,
     well, we can blow it up with oral tube.

[00:12:58:33]
LMP: Roger. Understand.

[00:13:02:11]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:13:03:10]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:13:04:18]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:13:06:12]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:13:06:16]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. Read you loud and clear.
     How us?

[00:13:06:19]
CC: Okay. Loud and clear. Didn't get you there for
     a while.

[00:13:06:24]
LMP: We have been reading you all along, Houston.

[00:13:06:26]
CC: Roger. Did you attempt to transmit, or were you
     just not getting through?

[00:13:06:35]
LMP: Roger. We attempted to transmit, and it sounded
     like you had a stuck mike there for a little while.

[00:13:06:46]
CC: Okay. That shouldn't make any difference to us on
     that Duplex mode. Okay. What I was calling for,
     Apollo 8 - we have got a maneuver PAD that is TLI
     plus 25. I would like to read up to you when you
     are ready for it.

[00:13:07:24]
_page : 6
LMP: Go ahead, Houston. TLI plus 25.

[00:13:07:28]

     do you read? Over.

[00:13:10:40]

[00:13:12:12]
CC: That's correct, Apollo 8. And we'll have a couple
     more things for you before too long. We're
     working on a flyby PAD at this time. And we're
     going to be talking some more to you about the
     problem of looking at stars in the sextant and
     telescope. And what we'd like to do as soon as
     the black team comes on the MOKR, while we have
     two teams here, we would like to get a rehash
     from you on exactly what you see and what you
     don't see and under what conditions, and see if
     we can define it so that everyone here understands
     what you've been telling us. And if you have
     any comments concerning the timeline - knowing
     that we got off our timeline before the burn -
     if you have any comments about that method of
     getting back on schedule, we'd like to hear
     those, too.

[00:13:13:06]
_page : 7
CDR: Roger. We have one request. CDR would like to
     get clearance to take a Seconal.

[00:13:13:21]
CC: Okay, Apollo. That's a GO.

[00:13:13:29]
LMP: Roger. And, Houston, this is 8. We might go
     over our future NAV sighting schedule if it's
     going to be revised at all.

[00:13:13:45]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. No planned revisions.

[00:13:13:50]
LMP: Roger.

[00:13:20:02]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[00:13:20:05]
CMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[00:13:20:07]

[00:13:25:12]
CMP: Roger.

[00:13:27:13]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston,

[00:13:27:17]
CMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[00:13:27:19]
CC: Okay. We've completed the dump and the tape
     recorder is yours, and we listened to the call
     data voice playback, and you've been given a GO
     for your first test in creative writing.

[00:13:27:36]
_page : 9
CMP: Roger. Are we in low bit rate now?

[00:13:27:43]
CC: That's negative. You're in high bit, and you
     understand that it's your tape recorder?

[00:13:27:53]
CMP: Roger. Are you going to stay in high bit all
     along, or are you going to be back to low here
     soon not that it matters much to us, really.

[00:13:28:12]
CC: Okay. We plan to stay in high bit rate. We were
     going to ask you if it made my difference, and
     you read our minds. That's pretty good for 63K.

[00:13:28:22]
CMP: Roger. That's an altitude record for mind reading.

[00:13:30:59]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[00:13:31:01]
CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8.

[00:13:31:04]
LMP: Roger. Onboard calculations indicate that at
     13 hours 30 minutes GET we are not 64 200 miles
     above the earth. That's using alternate slide
     rule.

[00:13:31:24]
CC: We've got 63 855.

[00:13:31:37]
LMP: Houston, this is Apollo 8. We're going to try to
     keep the conversation down here for a while so
     the CDR can go to sleep.

[00:13:31:45]
CC: Okay. We would like to get some comments from
     you before you sign off concerning the telescope,
     sextant, and verification that you have done
     something with the CO<sub>2</sub> in your Mae West and
     comment on the window status.

[00:13:32:06]
_page : 10
CMP: Roger. Is it a requirement that we do something
     with the CO<sub>2</sub> at this time? Over.

[00:13:32:11]
CC: No. That is negative.

[00:13:32:14]
CMP: Roger. We have maintained the same condition.
     We have left it as it was, and it will take care
     of it later.

[00:13:32:21]
CC: Okay.

[00:13:32:32]
CMP: Let me at this time go over the comments about
     the navigation as I see it so far.

[00:13:32:37]
CC: Go.

[00:13:32:42]
CMP: In the beginning, the operation with the S-IVB
     precluded immediate starting up of our sightings
     as we had scheduled since we had another evasive
     maneuver. The dumping of the S-IVB caused a
     tremendous amount of - of pseudo stars in the
     area which made an optics calibration practically
     impossible. The method which we had worked out
     did not seem to work too well. The method which
     I finally used was to go into P23, go to Sirius,
     which was our brightest star, get the shaft and
     trunnion, and then fly the spacecraft up to Sirius
     to use that for the optics CAL, which we did at a
     later time. With regards to light scatter, it
     appears that at almost any attitude during our
     passive thermal control, we are receiving light
     scattering in the scanning telescope. It takes
     the form mostly of a wide band of light right
     across the center of the scope about 10 degrees
     either direction of zero. It is very difficult to
     see stars in this area. The realignments have
     been good. I have been able to pick up the star
     in the sextant to do the alignment, but I was not
     able to identify the star which we used in such
     cases as Regor or Menkent in the scanning telescope.
     The first star sighting which I took of
     the earth showed a very indistinct horizon. But
     there did appear to be a very - or somewhat sharp
     line between what appeared to be the earth's horizon
     and the atmosphere. The landmark line-of-sight
     filter appeared to help out this horizon
     definition. There is a very hazy and indistinct
     horizon through - between the space and the top
     of the atmosphere itself, and this is a very difficult
     one to use. As I said before, at times,
     looking at the moon with the Sun in the near
     vicinity, the area around the moon, the space
     around the moon is not dark, but is a light - appears
     as a light blue. And this is also the same
     case as looking into the sextant during alignments
     with the star - with the sun in somewhat vicinity
     of the optics. However, I have no difficulty in
     finding these stars in the sextant. I also had
     no difficulty in spotting the stars I used, such
     as Sirius, Procyon, or Canopus against the earth
     during our star-horizon measurements. I can see
     all three of those stars against the earth background.
     I believe it will be very difficult to
     do a backup GDC alignment using the north set
     stars, since Navi is not too bright of a star.
     I was able to spot star constellations in the
     scanning telescope if they were very bright and
     well known, such as Cetus and Orion, stars of
     this nature. I was not able to perceive other
     constellations. That's about the only comments
     I have at this time. Over.

[00:13:36:48]
_page : 12
CC: Okay. Fine; thank you very much.

[00:13:36:55]
LMP: We are going to do - Houston - future maneuvers
     for P53 in a lower - slower mode of AUTO maneuver.
     Essentially, we are going to load the DAP with
     11101 to save fuel.

[00:13:37:16]
CC: Roger. That will be a 11101 DAP load.

[00:13:37:20]
LMP: Roger. We are going to try to save fuel that way.

[00:13:37:23]
CC: Good show.

[00:13:37:29]
LMP: With respect to the window, Houston: the windows
     1 and 5 have moderate haze on them. Satisfactory
     for visual observation, but possibly not for
     photography. Windows 2 and 4 are clear. Window
     3 is almost opaque. Over.

[00:13:37:53]
CC: Okay. Thank you.

[00:13:37:57]
_page : 13
LMP: And how is battery B looking to you?

[00:13:38:27]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. It looks like it may take
     another 6 hours on this battery B charge. It turns
     out that the charge rate is less than what we are
     getting on our ground curves, but it is still
     above the Apollo 7 curves, and it looks like it
     is going along now in good shape. And I would
     like to have verification that the timeline
     leading up to the midcourse correction was satisfactory
     from your point of view.

[00:13:38:57]
LMP: Roger. Seemed quite satisfactory.

[00:13:38:59]
CC: Okay. Thank you. And we will stay off the loop
     until you give us a call.

[00:13:39:04]
LMP: Roger. You don't bother us, but our replies make
     a lot of noise.

[00:13:39:13]
CC: Okay.

[00:14:43:00]
_page : 1

LMP: Houston. Apollo 8. How do you read?

[00:14:43:14]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.

[00:14:43:26]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. You're very weak. You got
     the proper OMNI?

[00:14:44:02]
LMP: Houston. Apollo. How do you read?

[00:14:44:04]
CC: Loud and clear, Bill. Go ahead.

[00:14:44:06]
LMP: Okay. I'm just wondering how your tracking's
     doing.

[00:14:44:14]
CC: Okay. We're still tracking you. We don't have
     any firm solutions, yet.

[00:14:44:29]
LMP: Okay. Things looking nominal up here. How
     about down there?

[00:14:44:33]
CC: Okay. The systems basically look good, Bill.
     We're going to be coming up on a cryo fan cycle
     period in another few minutes, and you can go
     ahead and do that when you get ready.

[00:14:44:46]
LMP: Okay.

[00:14:44:51]
CC: And I guess we picked up some suspicions about
     the fuel cell 2 radiator out temp. How does
     that compare on board?

[00:14:47:56]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[00:14:48:09]
CC: Apollo 8, you called?

[00:14:48:13]
LMP: We're showing RAD OUT temp on fuel cell 2
     would be about 90 degrees, and on 1 and 3 it would
     be slightly lower - maybe 75 or 80 degrees.
     About an hour ago you wondered about fuel cells
     performance; it looks like 1 and 2 are lower in
     performance than 3. Over.

[00:14:48:45]
_page : 2
CC: Roger. We show the same numbers on your outlet
     temperatures and thought that was a sensor failure.
     We've been watching the thing and we'll
     keep you advised of anything we see.

[00:14:49:01]
LMP: Okay.

[00:14:49:11]
CC: And on the performance, you're right - they are
     not quite the same, 1 and 2 are a little bit
     lower but all of these are sitting within the ballpark.

[00:14:49:24]
LMP: Roger. Fuel cell 1 has shown slightly a proportionately
     higher H<sub>2</sub> flow than O<sub>2</sub> flow all day long.

[00:14:49:35]
CC: Okay.

[00:14:49:41]
LMP: I'm showing 0.062 H<sub>2</sub> and 0.48 O<sub>2</sub>.

[00:14:49:53]
CC: Roger. We'll take some CAL curves on those.

[00:14:50:23]
CC: Okay. These things look reasonable to me and
     we'll keep looking at them. Our RAD OUT shows
     about 0.43 as opposed to your 0.48 on the oxygen,
     and we'll keep an eye on the CAL curves and just
     sort of watch it for you.

[00:14:50:39]
LMP: Okay. Thank you.

[00:14:50:46]
CC: If you'd like to set up some kind of a COMM check
     or specified time like every 30 minutes or so on
     these quiet periods, that would be okay with us.
     Might help to let us know that we're still in
     business.

[00:14:51:03]
LMP: All right. Just give me a call every now and then.

[00:14:51:06]
CC: Okay.

     the cryo fans ON?

[00:16:00:37]
LMP: Roger. We've had the cryo fans ON each for
     about 3 or 4 minutes.

[00:16:00:41]

     what we were watching, and you're coming through

[00:16:14:08]
CMP: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8 here.

[00:16:14:13]
CC: Okay, Jim. Got an update here to the flight plan.
     You've got the 16:55 star visibility check, and
     what we've got on that looks like Navi is still
     our star, and the numbers associated with that are
     roll 102.6, pitch 328.9, yaw 346.3. That gives
     you a shaft and trunnion of zero. And if you
     think you can - if you think you can do something
     with this, why we would like to go ahead and give
     it a try and see if we can either verify it or
     maybe we'll both learn something if we verify it
     if you can do it with Navi.

[00:16:15:03]
CMP: Roger. Standby one.

     looking through the scanning telescope. I can
     barely see any stars at all, and every time that
     the thruster will fire, you know, just completely
     blanks out my vision.

[00:17:17:04]
CMP: Roger. We are taking our time going to this
     new P23 attitude; going to Navi is quite a ways
     away from the attitude we need for P23. I have a
     correction to make on 20 - on Navi after getting
     dark adapted; you can pick out Cassiopeia and
     you can pick out Navi itself. It is difficult
     to see what stars are around. We still have
     quite a bit of particles that are floating with
     the spacecraft, especially when we move the optics
     and shaft. It seems to throw off a lot of particles.

     We're wondering about your GDC backup align;

     doing this align using Sirius and Rigel rather
     than Navi, as it's in the north set at this time.

_page : 6
CMP: Houston, this is Apollo 8. We concur. Sirius
     and Rigel would be two stars that would be much
     better than Navi and Polaris. However, I did
     Cassiopeia after I became adapted, but I'm
     afraid that the time required to do that type
     of alignment would be extensive if we ever had
     to go to that alignment.

[00:23:11:55]
CC: Roger, Frank. We would like to bring you up
     to date on your trajectory. This midcourse
     coming up at 28 hours GET turns out to be very
     small, 0.7 feet per second, and we would like
     not to do it. Our data is looking extremely
     good and extrapolating it forward; it shows
     the midcourse number 4 at LOI minus 8 hours
     would be about 4 feet per second. In the
     meantime, the free return trajectory is looking
     very good with a water splash point off the
     coast of Africa. So it looks like you are
     right down the old center line, and we propose
     not to do the next midcourse. Over.

[00:23:12:40]
CC: Okay. And in regard to your timeline here, we
     suggest that you let Bill and Jim sleep for an
     extra period of time and don't wake them up
     until 26:30 GET, and that would cause deletion
     of P52 and P23 at 26 hours GET. Over.

[00:23:13:08]

[00:23:13:12]

CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[00:23:40:43]
CDR: Go ahead.

[00:23:40:45]
CC: On your PTC, quads A, C, and D seem to be just
     about identical. Quad B is running slightly
     cooler, but only very slightly so. The temperature
     readouts in all respects are normal,
     so apparently the PTC is working well from a
     thermal viewpoint. And as far as the fuel consumption
     goes, it's minimal, just about like we
     expected. Have you got any comments about PTC?
     How does it seem to you?

[00:23:41:13]
CDR: Seems fine. Seems to be working all right, just
     like you said. I was just wondering how the
     readouts from the SPS were, too.

[00:23:41:48]
_page : 4
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. The SPS temperature is
     normal. If anything, it's slightly warmer
     than we expected, so you are in real good
     shape in that respect.

[00:23:41:59]
CDR: Thank you.

[00:23:42:19]
CC: Frank, the PU valve temperature is running
     about 72 degrees, which is better control than
     we got here in this room.

     on all four fans, a short burst from each of them
     as you did before.

[00:23:47:37]

CDR: How've you been reading our tape dumps?

[01:00:43:06]

     got your PTC attitude peaked up a bit, and I'll
     check on your tape dump.

[01:00:43:41]
_page : 2
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. The quality of the tape dump
     has been very good. We have about 15 minutes to
     dump, which we will do the next time we get high
     gain. Over.

[01:00:43:52]

[01:00:47:21]
CC: Frank, on this tape recorder, we have the tape
     motion stopped right now. If you would like to
     record some, we will give you the tape in motion
     so that you may do so. Is that what you would
     like? Over.

[01:00:47:31]

CMP: Good morning, Mike. How are things going down
     there?

[01:00:54:35]

     you doing up there? Did you get a good night's
     sleep?

[01:00:54:41]
CMP: Oh, you know. The first night in space all the
     time; it's a little slow.

[01:00:54:46]
CC: The old man woke you up earlier than he needed to.

[01:00:54:51]
CMP: Well, we just couldn't sleep any longer.

[01:00:54:55]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[01:00:55:01]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. The next time you are locked
     up on the high gain, give us a call, and we will
     configure for a dump. Over.

[01:00:55:16]
LMP: Roger. We would like an evaluation of the voice
     comments. Over.

[01:00:55:21]
CC: Roger. Understand. So far, it's been very good.
     We will evaluate this one as soon as we can.

LMP: Roger. I've been in the sack. How do the systems
     look?

[01:00:55:56]
CC: Everything is looking real good, Bill.

[01:00:56:00]
LMP: Okay. How much longer do you expect on charging
     battery A?

[01:00:56:11]
_page : 4
CC: Stand by, Bill. We will get you an exact number
     on it.

[01:00:56:16]
LMP: Just a rough estimate. And also, have you seen
     any more hints on that sensor problem on fuel
     cell 2?

[01:00:56:28]
CC: Stand by one. I'll get the latest scoop on it
     for you, Bill.

[01:00:56:56]
CC: Bill, there is nothing new on fuel cell number 2.
     We don't think there is anything at all wrong
     with the fuel cell. It's some sort of a sensor
     problem, but we don't have any new information
     on it.

[01:00:57:06]
LMP: Okay. They all look pretty good from here, Mike.

[01:00:57:11]
CC: Roger. Thank you.

[01:00:57:18]
CC: I've got some updates for you whenever you are
     ready to copy.

[01:00:57:24]
LMP: Stand by.

[01:00:57:26]
CC: Okay.

[01:00:57:31]
LMP: What kind?

[01:00:57:33]
CC: Well, I've got a TLI plus 35 hour update, and
     then I have an update to Jim's checklist.

[01:00:57:49]
LMP: Let's have the TLI plus 30 before we get the
     checklist update.

[01:00:57:54]
CMP: They never give up on the checklist, do they?

[01:00:57:57]
CC: Okay. This - when you get your maneuver PAD
     book out - the last maneuver PAD we gave you
     for the flyby PAD still remains valid. We would
     just like to remark that the entry angle, the
     Gamma, is slightly steeper than we consider
     ideal, but it's within our - sort of the noise
     level of our ability to predict at this time.
     So that flyby maneuver PAD remains valid. Over.

[01:00:58:28]
_page : 5
CMP: Roger, Houston.

[01:00:58:30]
CC: Okay. Now on that page with the flyby maneuver,
     under your north set of stars, I have some new
     numbers for you because we've changed those stars
     from Navi and Polaris. As you recall, we changed
     to Sirius and Rigel, so - And that also, by the
     way, is the checklist update which I will give
     you later - but on that maneuver PAD, I have got
     three new angles for you using Sirius and Rigel
     when you are ready to copy those.

[01:00:59:56]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read? Over.

     there for a few minutes. How are you reading
     me?

[01:01:01:31]
LMP: Roger. I'm reading you okay, Mike, and I read
     you the last time you asked me that, so I guess
     maybe I wasn't getting through to you.

[01:01:01:39]
_page : 6
CC: Okay. Well, did you copy on this flyby maneuver
     PAD? We've got three new angles. Are you ready
     to copy those?

     checklist. Over.

[01:01:08:06]
CMP: Roger. I've got it open. Go ahead, Mike.

[01:01:08:08]
CC: Okay. It's simply changing these north set of
     stars around. For Navi substitute Sirius, which
     is number 15, and for Rigel - correction - for
     Polaris substitute Rigel, number 12.

[01:01:08:31]
CMP: Roger. Substitute Rigel for Polaris and Sirius
     for Navi. How about shaft and trunnion; remain
     the same?

[01:01:08:38]
_page : 8
CC: Your shaft and trunnions remain the same. Sirius
     remains on the 50-degree line just like Navi used
     to be. Rigel is down 1.3 degrees from your horizontal,
     from your M-line. Over.

[01:01:08:56]
CMP: Roger. Understand.

[01:01:08:59]
CC: Okay. And let me know when it gets to be breakfast
     time. I've got a newspaper to read up to
     you and a few other things.

[01:01:09:06]
LMP: We're ready.

[01:01:09:11]
CC: Okay. I've got a Haney special here for you.
     The Interstellar Times latest edition says the
     flight to the man is occupying prime space on
     both paper and television; it's THE news story.
     The headlines of the Post says "Moon, here they
     come. We understand that Bill Anders will be
     in private conversation or communication today
     with an old man who wears a red suit and lives
     at the North Pole. A suspect in the Miami kidnapping
     was captured late yesterday, and the
     11 GI's that have been detained 5 months in
     Cambodia were released yesterday and will make
     it home in time for Christmas.

[01:01:09:57]
LMP: Roger. With reference to the first, we saw
     him earlier this morning, and he was heading
     your way.

[01:01:10:03]
_page : 9
CC: Roger. We'll pass the word along. David
     Eisenhower and Julie Nixon were married yesterday
     in New York. He was described as "nervous".

[01:01:10:15]
LMP: Right.

[01:01:10:18]
CC: The Browns took Dallas apart yesterday 31 to 20.
     We're sort of curious, who do you like today,
     Baltimore or Minnesota? Over.

[01:01:10:29]
CMP: Baltimore.

[01:01:10:31]
CC: How many points are you giving?

[01:01:10:34]
LMP: (Laughter) He's not making many points at home
     with that comment.

[01:01:10:40]
CC: Roger. Understand. Oh, I've got another score
     for you when you are ready to copy. Are you
     ready to copy?

[01:01:10:51]
LMP: Stand by. Go ahead.

[01:01:11:06]
CC: Roger. Navy 14, Army 21. Would you like for me
     to repeat that? Over.

[01:01:11:14]
LMP: You are very garbled; Houston; I'm unable to
     read. Will call you back in another year.

[01:01:11:21]
CC: Okay. We also notice the University of Houston
     lost their first home basketball game in
     3-1/2 years last night. Illinois edged them
     out 97 to 84. And some really big news: the
     State Department announced only a few minutes
     ago that the Pueblo crew will be released at
     9 p.m. tonight.

[01:01:11:48]
_page : 10
CMP: Sounds good. Outboard calculations indicate
     that Apollo 8 at 25 hours is 104 000 miles from
     home.

[01:01:12:00]
CC: Yes. Our plot board shows a similar number.

[01:01:12:07]
CDR: Mighty nice view from here.

[01:01:12:12]
CC: We're showing about 104 800 miles, and we're
     guessing another 8 to 10 hours on your battery
     charge.

[01:01:12:23]
LMP: Okay.

[01:01:12:35]
CC: Frank, say again about the view. You were
     blocked, I think.

[01:01:12:41]
CDR: This is a mighty nice view we have down there
     today. A little bit more than a half earth.
     Looks like Africa and the Red Sea is visible;
     we're not quite sure as there is quite a bit
     of cloud cover; but even through the hazy windows, it's mighty nice.

[01:01:12:58]
CC: How are your windows? Do you have a couple left
     that are real clear?

[01:01:13:02]
CDR: The rendezvous windows are good. The others
     are all about the same as they were when we last
     reported. One and five have a slight haze and
     a little fog on the inside.

[01:01:13:16]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[01:01:16:55]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[01:01:16:59]
CMP: ...

[01:01:17:01]
_page : 11
CC: Roger. Just as a matter of curiosity for Bill,
     we can say a few words about the heaters for the
     cryo tanks, and also for the fans. We've noticed
     that the heaters are doing their thing normally,
     cycling on and off; and as time goes by, this
     cycle rate increases, indicating a little bit of
     stratification in the tanks. And then when we've
     been turning the fans on every 4 hours for a couple
     of minutes, this stirs things up and the
     heaters then cycling on and off again more
     slowly for awhile, until again a little bit of
     stratification occurs, and the cycling becomes
     slightly more rapid. This is, of course, normal;
     we just point it out as a curiosity to you. Over.

[01:01:17:45]
LMP: Roger. I haven't really been following it that
     close. One thing I have noticed is when you
     turn the fans on you get a glitch in the quantity,
     which might correspond to a glitch in AC.
     Maybe the next time we'll look at the AC volts
     and see what happens.

[01:01:18:14]
CC: Our experts say that's not the reason for the
     glitch. They say the stratification fakes out
     the capacitance sensor there for a second.

[01:01:18:25]
LMP: I knew they would have some big deal answer
     for me.

[01:01:18:31]
CC: ... got you today.

[01:01:18:32]
_page : 12
LMP: I'll buy that.

[01:01:18:33]
CMP: Roger.

[01:01:18:36]
CC: Any other information you want us to send up
     to you?

[01:01:18:43]
LMP: No, we're going to zap you with the high gain
     here shortly.

[01:01:18:46]

LMP: Houston, this is Apollo 8. How do you read on
     the high gain?

[01:01:19:39]
CC: Reading you loud and clear, Bill. How me?

[01:01:19:44]
LMP: I'm reading you loud and clear. I'll go ahead
     and dump this. You might want to listen to it
     in real time to evaluate the voice.

[01:01:19:54]
CC: Okay. We'll do that as soon as we can.

[01:01:19:57]
LMP: Give me a call when you are ready.

[01:01:20:08]
CC: Do you want to dump it by your command, or would
     you like us to command the dump on it? Over.

[01:01:20:15]
LMP: Oh, you can go ahead and command whenever you
     are ready.

[01:01:20:18]
CC: Okay. we are starting now; thank you.

[01:01:20:19]
LMP: I've already rewound.

[01:01:21:02]
LMP: There is only about 5 minutes worth on the tape,
     Houston.

[01:01:21:07]
CC: Roger. Understand, Bill. You promised me you
     would wait 3 days before you started doing this,
     Bill.

[01:01:21:31]
LMP: It has been a long trip.

[01:01:26:48]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:01:26:52]
LMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[01:01:26:53]
CC: Roger, Bill. We've got your dump, and the voice
     quality is very good. We we going to take about
     20 minutes or so to get it back to Houston to

[01:01:43:32]
CC: Roger, Bill. We are reading you loud and clear

CC: Roger, Jim. When we lost our antenna down here,
     we interrupted your tape dump, so we are in the
     process of doing some rewinding and continuing
     the dump, in case Bill is wondering what is going
     on with the tape recorder.

[01:01:45:33]
CMP: Okay. No strain.

[01:01:56:53]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

LMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[01:01:56:58]
CC: Roger. At 26 hours GET, we'll be switching our
     antennas back again at Madrid, and you can expect
     a glitch on your COMM system.

[01:01:57:12]
LMP: Roger.

[01:01:57:17]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[01:01:57:18]
CC: Go ahead, Jim.

[01:01:57:21]
CMP: I noticed that you skipped the IMU alignment for
     about 26 hours because we were still asleep. Do
     you want to include that again, or do you think
     it is required?

[01:01:57:33]
CC: Roger, Jim. We think it is going to be required
     prior to the next set of P23 sightings, and we're
     suggesting that it be put in at 27:45. We'll
     have a flight plan - a more complete flight plan
     update in here shortly.

[01:01:57:51]
CMP: Okay. Fine. We're in the process of having
     breakfast.

     RTC's coming through on normal voice.

[01:02:44:44]

[01:02:44:58]
LMP: A little squeak.

[01:02:46:34]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[01:02:46:39]
LMP: Go ahead.

[01:02:46:41]
CC: Roger. I have a flight plan update for you
     sometime at your convenience.

[01:02:46:47]
LMP: Alright.

[01:02:47:50]
LMP: Ready to copy.

[01:02:47:53]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Were you calling? Over.

[01:02:47:56]
LMP: Roger. Ready to copy.

[01:02:47:58]
_page : 5
CC: Okay, Bill. This will be on page 2 dash 22 of
     your flight plan.  For the command module pilot -
     I've already mentioned it to him - but at the
     top of the page, at about 27:45, actually, we
     would like him to do a P52, an IMU alignment,
     and then the P23 should be done as scheduled.
     Those four stars, Procyon, Regulus, Alphard, and
     Spica: we realize Alphard may not be too good
     a star, Regulus is about 3 degrees above the
     horizon, and Spica is at a 48-degree trunnion
     angle; so I guess what we are saying is if Jim
     has difficulty doing one set on each of those
     four stars, we suggest that he omit whichever
     one he is having difficulty with and pick it up
     by doing two sets on some other star that he
     likes. Over.

[01:02:49:09]
LMP: Roger. Understand.

[01:02:49:10]
CC: All right. In the lower right hand corner of
     page 2-22, the passive thermal control attitude
     should read "pitch 224 degrees, yaw 020."

[01:02:49:29]
LMP: Roger. Copy.

[01:02:49:31]
CC: And on the next page, at about 29 hours, you
     can resume the normal flight plan. We would
     like to make one addition; at 29:30, add a
     waste water dump. Even though one is not really
     required at that time, we would like to get the
     dump out of the way so we can track you uninterruptedly
     without any dumping, you know, as
     we are coming up on midcourse correction number
     3. Over.

[01:02:50:03]
_page : 6
LMP: Roger.

[01:02:50:06]
CC: That's about all, Bill. You got any questions
     on this?

[01:02:50:11]
LMP: No, it looks pretty good. We've been saving up
     some water of our own to dump here, so that will
     work out all right.

[01:02:50:18]
CC: Very good. And don't ruin Jim's optics.

[01:02:50:24]
LMP: Right.

[01:02:50:48]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:02:50:51]
LMP: Go.

[01:02:50:52]
CC: Roger. We would like P00 in ACCEPT, please. We
     would like to send you up a P27. It's a LM state
     vector, going into the LM slot only, and we do
     not want you to transfer it over to the CSM.

[01:02:51:24]
CC: Apollo 8. Houston. Did you copy?

[01:02:51:28]
LMP: Roger. You got it.

[01:02:51:34]
CC: Okay. We got it. We're sending you a LM state
     vector, and we would like you not to transfer
     that vector over to the CSM slot.

[01:02:51:40]

CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[01:06:10:38]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[01:06:10:39]
CC: Okay. S-band OFF state to OFF. That returns
     us to normal configuration, and we need a couple
     or items from you. First, the CMP and LMP status
     report (including PRD readings on all three crewmembers),
     and we'd like to know did you chlorinate
     the water after your last meal. Over.

[01:06:11:10]
CDR: No, we haven't chlorinated the water, yet. We'll
     get the other for you.

[01:06:11:13]
CC: Roger. Thank you.

[01:06:11:14]
LMP: Houston, do you show the FM - Houston, Apollo 8 -
     do you show the FM on now?

[01:06:11:22]
CC: Stand by and we'll check it, Bill.

[01:06:11:26]
LMP: Because our S-baud off state has been OFF. Possibly
     - we don't have control or it.

[01:06:12:29]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We've switched on all the
     communications switch; functions are operating
     normally, Bill.

[01:06:12:37]
LMP: Okay, Mike. Thanks.

[01:06:12:43]
_page : 3
CDR: Mike, the PRD readings for the CDR are 4 - that's
     0.04, for the CMP is 0.64, and for the LMP is 0.25.

[01:06:12:59]
CC: Good. I copy 0.04, 0.64, 0.25. Thank you.

[01:06:13:06]
CDR: Roger.

[01:06:22:25]
CDR: Houston, this is Apollo 8.

[01:06:22:33]
CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8.

[01:06:22:37]
CDR: Oh, hi, Ken. How are you doing?

[01:06:22:39]
CC: Roger. Fine. How you been?

[01:06:22:41]
CDR: Is this Jerry?

[01:06:22:42]
CC: This is Ken.

[01:06:22:44]
CDR: Hey, listen, we still have this TV coming up
     here - let's see - 31:20?

[01:06:22:52]
CC: Affirmative.

[01:06:23:00]
CDR: We're about in the right position for high gain;
     we wondered if you wanted to take a trial run
     and see if it will work. Or do you just want to
     wait and try it when they're supposed to go on
     the air with it?

[01:06:23:18]
CC: Okay. Stand by on that.

[01:06:23:23]
CDR: Okay.

[01:06:30:25]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. Over.

[01:06:30:27]
CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8.

[01:06:30:33]
LMP: Roger. Could you ask the GNC to give us an update
     on our prop quantity, please?

[01:06:30:41]
CC: Wilco. You're referring to the RCS?

[01:06:30:46]
LMP: Roger.

[01:06:30:53]
_page : 4
LMP: If you'll give it to me kinda slow, I'll plot it.

[01:06:30:56]
CC: Roger. It's coming now.

[01:06:35:13]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:06:35:19]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[01:06:35:20]
CC: Okay. In reference the early TV, we're losing
     the high-gain antenna now, and it looks like the
     only way we would have gotten the early TV pass
     in anyhow was to send it to remote site and
     look at it there. So we're going to scrub
     that idea and we'll just pick up with the
     scheduled TV. The COMM checks that are remaining
     are the high-gain dependent type, and
     we'll put those off until the TV session is completed,
     and we are working on the fuel propellant
     curve for you now.

[01:06:35:53]
CDR: Thank you.

[01:06:41:50]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:06:41:53]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[01:06:41:54]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. What we're going to do on the
     TV is to go ahead and let you crank it up as
     soon as we get back on the high-gain antenna,
     and it looks like - my guess is that this will
     be about 31:07, and we'll just use this to - as
     long as we have the coverage there. I have an
     update to your TLI plus 35 PAD. Now we have to
     correct a couple of tines on there. So when you
     get that out, let me know and I'll read it to you.

[01:06:42:38]
_page : 5
CDR: Go ahead.

[01:06:42:40]
CC: Okay. On the TLI plus 35 pass, the update I
     want to give you is the last three lines in the
     block: the EMS range to go 13084 35985 0984217.
     Over.

[01:06:43:11]
CDR: Understand. Range to go 13084 35985 0984217.

[01:06:43:21]
CC: Affirmative.

[01:06:44:54]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We are about to have a handover
     to Goldstone, and our downlink isn't improved
     then. I don't know if you'll notice any difference
     in the uplink or not.

[01:06:45:52]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:06:46:44]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:06:46:48]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. You are loud and clear.

[01:06:46:51]
CC: Okay. We have switched sites over to Goldstone
     now. I don't know if you can tell any difference
     in our uplink.

[01:06:47:01]
CDR: Negative. You're about the same.

[01:06:47:03]
CC: Okay. You have cleared up quite a bit. Sounds
     a lot better to us.

[01:06:47:08]
CDR: Okay.

[01:06:49:35]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:06:49:38]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[01:06:49:40]
CC: I have some RCS quantity data for you. We are
     all set up to receive the TV whenever you get
     high gain looking at us.

[01:06:49:51]
_page : 6
CDR: Okay. Let me get the chart out here.

[01:06:50:20]
CDR: Go ahead with the quad propellant quantities,
     please.

[01:06:50:25]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8, Alfa, I have 225 pounds, 74 percent;
     Bravo 240 - -

[01:06:50:41]
CDR: Slower, please.

[01:06:50:42]
CC: Roger. I will repeat. Alfa 225, 74 percent;
     Bravo 240 pounds, 79 percent; Charlie 236,
     78 percent; Delta 238, 19 percent. I would
     like to remind you on the TV that we need narrow
     beam width when you get up in high gain.
     Over.

[01:06:51:45]
CDR: Roger. Understand.

[01:07:07:18]
CDR: Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.

[01:07:07:20]
CC: Loud sad clear, Apollo 8.

[01:07:07:24]
CDR: Okay. Thank you.

[01:07:09:57]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?

[01:07:09:59]
CC: Apollo 8. Loud and clear and standing by.

[01:07:10:04]
CDR: Say again.

[01:07:10:05]
CC: We read you loud and clear, and we're standing
     by.

[01:07:10:09]
CDR: Okay.

[01:07:10:23]
CDR: Are you receiving television now?

[01:07:10:36]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We just got it.

[01:07:10:43]
CDR: You are getting it?

[01:07:10:52]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. We have a good picture.

[01:07:10:54]
_page : 7
CDR: We're rolling a -

[01:07:10:57]
CDR: Okay. We're rolling around to a good view of
     the earth, and as soon as we get to the good
     view of the earth, we'll stop and let you look
     out the window at the scene that we see. Jim
     Lovell's down in lower equipment bay preparing
     lunch, and Bill is holding a camera here for us
     both.

[01:07:11:29]
CDR: Bill's going to take the camera down to the lower
     equipment deck with Jim.

[01:07:11:34]
CC: Roger.

[01:07:11:37]
CC: Okay. We're getting a pretty good picture, but
     if you'd move it a little slower - every time
     you move it around, it breaks up the scan.

[01:07:11:47]
CDR: We gotcha.

[01:07:11:49]
CC: (Laughter)

[01:07:11:54]
CMP: This is known as preparing lunch and doing P23
     at the same time.

[01:07:12:18]
CC: You've got everybody standing on their heads
     down here.

[01:07:12:23]
CDR: How go - Has he got it turned upside down? You've
     got the wrong REFSMMAT.

[01:07:12:31]
CC: Well, we all have our problems.

[01:07:12:44]
CDR: How is the picture now, Houston?

[01:07:12:46]
CC: They are really good.

[01:07:12:52]
CDR: Okay. Now we are coming up on the view that we
     really want you to see. That's the view of the
     earth, and if you will break for just a minute,
     Bill is going to put on the large lens. So we
     will be right back with you.

[01:07:13:03]
_page : 8
CC: Okay. Thank you.

[01:07:13:54]
CDR: Houston, we are now showing you a view of the
     earth through the telephoto lens.

[01:07:14:00]
CC: Okay. We are not receiving a picture right now.

[01:07:14:08]
CDR: How about now?

[01:07:14:14]
CC: Okay. We don't have a picture yet.

[01:07:14:27]
CDR: You seeing anything at all, Houston?

[01:07:14:36]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. We don't have a picture yet.

[01:07:14:46]
CDR: Alright. We will put the other lens back on, and
     we will show you that.

[01:07:14:50]
CC: Apollo 8, how about standing by on that for
     just a minute. Let's check our ground link.

[01:07:15:06]
CC: Apollo 8, we have a picture now.

[01:07:15:10]
CDR: Okay. Let's try the other lens again then, once
     again.

[01:07:15:13]
CC: Okay. Thank you.

[01:07:15:30]
CDR: Do you have a picture now?

[01:07:15:31]
CC: That's negative.

[01:07:15:45]
CC: Apollo 8, ...

[01:07:15:54]
CDR: Okay. Do you have anything. Houston? We have
     it on the earth.

[01:07:15:58]
CC: We are having no joy.

[01:07:16:02]
CDR: Okay. Standby.

[01:07:16:04]
CDR: Okay. How about now, Houston?

[01:07:16:10]
_page : 9
CC: Still no joy.

[01:07:16:18]
CC: You don't have a lens cover on there, do you?

[01:07:16:22]
CDR: No. We checked that, as a matter of fact.

[01:07:16:30]
CDR: Anything?

[01:07:16:32]
CC: Still no joy.

[01:07:16:56]
CDR: How about now?

[01:07:16:57]
CC: Still no joy. There is a picture. We have a picture.
     Okay. It is a little difficult to see
     what we have.

[01:07:17:17]
CDR: That is the earth, but it is not the telephoto
     lens, unfortunately. It is just a regular inside
     lens.

[01:07:17:23]
CC: Okay. It is coming in as a real bright blob on
     the screen. It is hard to tell what we are
     looking at.

[01:07:17:31]
CDR: You are looking through some haze on the windows
     too, unfortunately.

[01:07:17:37]
CMP: And the earth is very bright, besides.

[01:07:17:41]
CC: Okay. We got the earth in about the center of
     the screen and a little bit low, and it looked
     like there were some objects that moved across
     it - the screen at the same time. Do you have
     any comment on those?

[01:07:17:54]
CDR: That is some of the water - ice coming off the
     vent nozzle.

[01:07:17:59]
CC: Roger.

[01:07:18:05]
_page : 10
CDR: How does it look now?

[01:07:18:06]
CC: Still the same thing; it is - the target is
     extremely bright, and it is very difficult to
     make out what we are looking at.

[01:07:18:16]
CDR: It is unfortunate that we do not have - we can't
     make the other lens work here. I don't know
     what the problem is.

[01:07:18:24]
CC: Okay. Apollo 8, would you verify that the ALC
     is on?

[01:07:18:33]
CDR: We have tried it both ways.

[01:07:18:35]
CC: Oh, okay; thank you. What we are getting now is
     a good picture.

[01:07:18:39]
CDR: Say again.

[01:07:18:44]
CC: Okay. That's a - that's a real good picture.
     That is the best one that we have had. And how
     about going ahead and just leaving your pictures
     inside until we can think some more of what we
     can do to adjust for that light?

[01:07:18:58]
CDR: Roger. Jim, what are you doing here? Jim is
     fixing dessert. He is making up a bag of chocolate
     pudding. You can see it come floating by.
     Bill is coming up from the lower equipment bay.
     It is unfortunate that this telephoto lens.
     doesn't work. Show them the lens that's the
     culprit here, Jim. This lens doesn't seem to
     be working; I can't understand why we're not -
     perhaps it's a problem of light transmission
     through it.

[01:07:19:56]
_page : 11
CDR: This transmission is coming to you approximately
     halfway between the moon and the earth. We have
     been 31 hours and about 20 minutes into flight.
     We have about less than 40 hours to go to the
     moon. You can see that Bill has his toothbrush
     here. He has been brushing regularly. To demonstrate
     how things float around in zero g. It
     looks like he plays for the Astros, the way he
     tries to catch those things. I certainly wish
     that we could show you the earth. It is a
     beautiful, beautiful view, with predominately
     blue background and just huge covers of white
     clouds, particularly one very strong vortex up
     near the terminator. Very, very beautiful.
     Perhaps we will get some assistance from the
     people on the ground and be able to deter - to
     determine why this other lens is not transmitting
     properly.

[01:07:21:11]
LMP: Houston, did you get any light at all coming
     through that telephoto lens?

[01:07:21:18]
CC: Apollo 8, we were getting what you were showing
     us on your normal lens, and I don't think we got
     anything on the telephoto. We are working on
     this now. One of the problems seems to be that
     it is a low light level lens; we're afraid that
     you might burn it out pointing it at something
     too bright.

[01:07:21:40]
_page : 12
CDR: Well, the earth is very, very bright. There is
     nothing in the lens you can burn out. The camera
     still seems to be working. We can give you
     a lumens reading of the earth right now if
     you like.

[01:07:21:54]
CC: Hey, Frank, how about a couple of words on your
     health for the wide world.

[01:07:22:03]
CDR: Well, we are all in very good shape. Jim is
     busy working preparing lunch. Bill is playing
     cameraman right now, and I am about to take a
     light reading on the earth. We all feel fine.
     It was a very exciting ride on that big Saturn,
     but it worked perfectly, and we are looking
     forward now, of course, for the day after tomorrow
     when we will be just 60 miles any from the
     moon.

[01:07:22:33]
CC: Roger. You all look great on candid TV.

[01:07:22:44]
CDR: Okay. I just got a reading on the earth, Houston.
     It is 320. The earth is showing 320 lumens now.
     If you get a closeup of Jim Lovell, Bill, you
     can let everyone see he has already outdistanced
     us in the beard race. Jim has got quite a beard
     going already.

[01:07:23:28]
_page : 13
CMP: Happy birthday, Mother.

[01:07:23:49]
CDR: Okay. Jim is going to take a shot of us from
     the lower equipment bay, and then we have to get
     back to our passive thermal control in the bar-b-que
     mode so that we don't get one side of the
     spacecraft too hot for too long at a time. So
     we will be signing off here, and we will be
     looking forward to seeing you all again shortly.

[01:07:24:10]
CC: Roger.

[01:07:24:13]
CDR: Goodbye from Apollo 8.

[01:07:24:17]
CC: Thank you. That's a good show.

[01:07:24:24]
CDR: I hope we can get that other lens fixed or some
     reading on it.

[01:07:24:31]
CC: Roger. We are going to work on that one. The
     one that is sensitive to light is the lens that
     you were just using. You want to be careful
     about pointing that at some bright object.

[01:07:24:43]
CDR: Roger. We are starting PTC again.

[01:07:24:45]
LMP: I believe that's only if it hasn't been used for
     quite a while, Ken.

CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:07:40:08]
CDR: Go ahead Houston, Apollo 8.

[01:07:40:10]
CC: Okay, I've got a few items for you I'd like to
     clear up and then we'll let you alone for a
     while. The first thing is we would like for you
     to confirm that your spot meter had an ASA setting
     of 100.

[01:07:40:27]
CDR: That is confirmed.

[01:07:40:30]
CC: Okay, we thank you. That's one of the first
     questions that came to mind. We are ready for
     a cryo fan cycle at any time and use your normal
     procedures.

[01:07:40:47]
CDR: Okay.

[01:07:40:49]
CC: All right. You can anticipate a fuel cell purge
     at 35 hours, and we ought to be through with
     battery A charging somewhere after 34 hours; and
     looks like you'll have just about a full battery
     there. And we will give you a call on the exact
     time to cut it off. We would like to get some
     confirmation from you on the chlorine procedures.
     Did you get some in last night or not? Just a
     quick summary of how much sleep you got on Lovell
     and Anders?

[01:07:41:26]
CDR: Okay. We got the chlorine in and the water has
     been chlorinated and just a minute I will check
     with them on their sleep.

[01:07:41:40]
_page : 2
CC: I am sorry I didn't copy that sleep.

[01:07:41:44]
CDR: Say again, Ken.

[01:07:41:46]
CC: I am sorry I didn't copy your last, Frank.

[01:07:41:50]
CDR: I was asking you to say, to say what you said.
     Jim had about 4 hours sleep, and Bill had about
     3 hours sleep.

[01:07:42:07]
CC: Okay. Thank you very much.

[01:07:42:12]
CDR: We feel pretty good today. We would like to see,
     in looking over the flight plan - perhaps we ought
     to put the rest periods a little bit shorter and
     more frequent. It seems it might work out better.
     We got all out of kilter on it yesterday. We
     are sort of trying to get back in a normal cycle.

[01:07:42:32]
CC: Okay. We will look into that.

[01:07:42:44]
CDR: You all are doing good work. Keep it up.

[01:07:42:46]
CC: Thank you. Looks like the only other
     thing we have left over is a COMM check and if
     we can work that in without interrupting your
     present schedule we would like to.

[01:07:42:58]
CDR: Okay. Right now we are stopping for a break,
     but we will go ahead and do that. What does it
     involve?

[01:07:43:06]
CC: Okay. We will need the high-gain antenna, and
     there should be no COMM loss during this mode.

[01:07:43:22]
CDR: Okay, Ken. I think we are going to lose the high
     gain here shortly. Why don't we pick it up next
     time it comes around?

[01:07:43:27]
_page : 3
CC: Real fine.

[01:07:43:31]
CDR: Remember, the most important part of the trip
     occurs in two days when we start back. So you
     all get better rested too.

[01:07:43:40]
CC: We'll do that.

[01:07:43:41]
CC: Affirmative, Apollo 8.

[01:07:52:41]
CDR: Houston, we're starting the H<sub>2</sub> fan now.

[01:07:52:51]
CC: Roger, thank you.

[01:07:54:48]
CDR: Houston, you just wanted 2 minutes cycling on
     those fans don't you? Two minutes each?

[01:07:55:04]
CC: That's affirmative, Apollo 8.

[01:07:55:08]
CDR: Roger.

[01:08:06:07]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8 on high gain stand by for your
     communications check.

[01:08:06:12]
CC: Okay, standing by.

[01:08:11:26]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:08:11:31]
CDR: Go ahead Houston, Apollo 8.

[01:08:11:33]
CC: Okay. Apollo 8. Looks like we're going to have
     to put this COMM test off because of some tracking
     requirements. We can do it in about an hour if
     this will not interfere with your present operations
     too much. It'll take maybe 15 to 20 minutes,
     and it will involve some conversation on the part
     of the people onboard the spacecraft. So if that's
     going to interfere with your sleeping and all, why
     go ahead and we'll defer to that and we'll pick
     these requirements up at another time. And,
     we've got a score here, looks like Baltimore 21
     to nothing.

CDR: Who were they playing?

[01:08:12:26]
CC: How about Minnesota.

[01:08:12:30]
CDR: That's from that other league.

[01:08:22:33]
CMP: How did last year's Army-Navy game come out?

[01:08:22:47]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. Over.

[01:08:22:49]
CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8.

[01:08:22:53]
LMP: Roger. We've stirred up all the cryos. Could
     you give me your quantities, please?

[01:08:23:00]
CC: Okay. Stand by.

[01:08:23:04]
LMP: Roger. Be advised the CMP just hit the hay for
     awhile, and the LMP will go down in a little while.

[01:08:23:12]
CC: Okay. And our guys down here are watching high-gain
     antenna pointing program, so anytime you're
     not using the DSKY for anything else, they'd like
     to watch it for a couple of cycles, so if you
     would leave that NOUN 51 on the display it will
     help a lot down here.

[01:08:23:31]
LMP: Okay. Why don't you give us REACQ angles, and
     we'll try that for the next time.

[01:08:23:44]
CC: Okay.

[01:08:24:37]
CC: Apollo 8, are you ready to copy some cryo quantities?

[01:08:24:45]
LMP: I'm ready. How about O<sub>2</sub> first.

[01:08:24:47]
_page : 5
CC: Okay. O<sub>2</sub> tank 1, I show 88.1 percent.

[01:08:24:55]
LMP: Okay. Could you give it to me in pounds, please?

[01:08:25:02]
CC: Okay. You'll have to stand by while we convert
     that.

[01:08:25:05]
LMP: Thank you.

[01:08:25:15]
LMP: That's okay, Gene, go ahead, I'll take the percent.

[01:08:25:19]
CC: Okay. We will try and get the pounds for you, too,
     Bill. Tank 1, oxygen 88.1.

[01:08:25:29]
LMP: What time is that for?

[01:08:25:30]
CC: This is present.

[01:08:25:34]
LMP: 32:30, okay.

[01:08:25:38]
CC: Okay, I've got 32:35. And O<sub>2</sub> - -

[01:08:25:45]
LMP: In weight not percentage.

[01:08:25:46]
CC: Okay, O<sub>2</sub> tank 1, 88.1, O<sub>2</sub> tank 2, 87.37.

[01:08:26:14]
LMP: Is that 0.37 or 0.36?

[01:08:26:17]
CC: 0.37.

[01:08:26:22]
LMP: Roger, 2. Got it.

[01:08:26:23]
CC: Okay, 2 tank 1, 75.97. Tank 2, 78.06. Over.

[01:08:26:50]
LMP: Okay, thank you very much. It looks good.

[01:08:26:52]
CC: Okay, thank you.

[01:08:40:03]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:08:40:07]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston, Apollo 8.

[01:08:40:10]
CC: Okay. I've got a couple of things we need from
     you. I would like to get a battery C voltage.
     I would like to check a battery manifold pressure.
     Your high gain - -

[01:08:40:25]
_page : 6
CDR: Battery C is 37 volts.

[01:08:40:28]
CC: Understand 37 volts on battery C. Is that affirm?

[01:08:40:32]
CDR: 3, 7.

[01:08:40:34]
CC: Okay, thank you. And if you can get to the
     battery manifold pressure, like to read that one.

[01:08:40:42]
CDR: 0.6 volts.

[01:08:40:44]
CC: All right understand 0.6 volts. The angles you
     asked for on the high-gain antenna are pitch minus
     45, and yaw 90.

[01:08:41:43]
CDR: Okay. Houston, this is Apollo 8. I'm going to
     just go into high gain now, and we're about ready
     to pick you up ... works on REACQ.

[01:08:41:50]
CC: Okay, and I have a scanning telescope star visibility
     item for you to pick up, when you're ready to
     copy that.

[01:08:42:06]
CDR: Roger, we'll get that on high gain when we get
     back to you.

[01:08:42:10]
CC: Okay, thank you.

[01:08:42:11]
CDR: We'll come back on high-gain.

[01:08:42:12]
CC: Roger.

[01:08:42:23]
CDR: That's not fair, we're there already.

[01:08:42:28]
CC: That's pretty good acquisition, huh?

[01:08:42:34]
CDR: You guys are reading the DSKY. Go ahead Houston.

[01:08:42:40]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. Maybe we ought to try that one
     again next time, and the scanning telescope star
     visibility is scheduled for a 34:10 in the flight
     plan, and it'll be star number 31. The angles
     are roll 184.7, pitch 23.4, yaw 14.3, shaft and
     trunnion zero. Over.

[01:08:43:28]
_page : 7
CDR: Understand; star 31, roll 184 7, pitch 23 4,
     yaw 14 3, and star shaft and trunnion at zero.

[01:08:43:38]
CC: That's affirm, and that's copy star 31.

[01:08:43:45]
CDR: That's Roger, 31.

[01:08:43:47]
CC: Okay, thank you.

[01:08:44:18]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[01:08:44:20]
CC: Go ahead.

[01:08:44:24]
LMP: The LMP would like to take a Seconal and hit
     the hay.

[01:08:44:36]
CC: Okay. That's a GO.

[01:08:44:41]
LMP: Okay, thank you.

[01:08:44:45]
LMP: And that ...

[01:08:50:06]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:08:50:10]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[01:08:50:12]
CC: Okay. We'd like to go ahead and get into this
     COMM check here, on the last of this high-gain
     period. If you're ready to go on it I'll read
     you some witches.

[01:08:50:27]
CDR: Standby. We're ready. Go ahead.

[01:08:50:29]
CC: Okay. Number 1. S-band normal mode voice to
     VOICE.

[01:08:50:43]
CDR: Go ahead - keep going.

[01:08:50:44]
CC: Uptelemetry data to DATA.

[01:08:51:08]
_page : 8
CC: CDR Normal mode voice to VOICE. Uptelemetry data
     to DATA.

[01:08:51:12]
CC: Okay, uptelemetry command to NORMAL.

[01:08:51:17]
CDR: NORMAL.

[01:08:51:18]
CC: High-gain antenna track, AUTO.

[01:08:51:25]
CDR: Roger. Going AUTO.

[01:08:51:27]
CC: High-gain antenna beam width to NARROW.

[01:08:51:30]
CDR: Beam-width NARROW.

[01:08:51:33]
CC: Okay, this will be our base-line data check.
     This will be a full uplink voice with ranging
     and full downlink.

[01:08:57:53]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We are going to have to delay
     the COMM check again.

[01:09:01:09]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8. how do you read?

[01:09:01:13]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Did you call?

[01:09:01:18]
CDR: Roger. We lost you for a while there. Are you
     reading us there now?

[01:09:01:20]
CC: Loud and clear now.

[01:09:01:24]
CDR: Okay. Thank you. So are we.

[01:09:01:36]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. Do you want to try that AUTO
     REACQ? 33 plus 24 looks like a good time and the
     angles are the same. And the late ball scores is 24 to 14 - -

[01:09:01:48]
CDR: ...

[01:09:01:51]
CC: All right.

[01:09:01:53]
CDR: Say it again.

[01:09:01:54]
_page : 9
CC: I say a late ball score there is - -

[01:09:01:55]
CDR: ... the ball score?

[01:09:01:56]
CC: 2, 4 to 1, 4.

[01:09:02:02]
CDR: Baltimore over the Vikings?

[01:09:02:05]
CC: Affirm.

[01:09:05:56]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[01:09:05:58]
CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8.

[01:09:06:02]
CDR: We have reached the scan limit on the high gain.
     what do you want us to do about it now?

[01:09:06:39]
CC: Apollo 8, what we would like to do with these
     angles is to set it in AUTO REACQ over on panel 2,
     and it is under the tracking for the high-gain
     antenna, and it'll - the lower position will say
     REACQ, and on the position dials we would like
     to set pitch to minus 45 and the yaw to 90.

[01:09:07:08]
CDR: Pitch minus 45, yaw 90.

[01:09:07:10]
CC: Okay. Stand by 1.

[01:09:07:15]
CDR: Roger. If we could leave it in REACQ if you want
     to use the high gain, it would keep from waking us
     up every REV.
     END OF TAPE

[01:09:10:32]
_page : 1
_tape : Tape 24
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. I think we may have gotten
     off on a tangent. These pitch and yaw angles
     that we called up to you for the high gain
     antenna were in response to Bill's request to
     know what positions we could put on there for a
     - for the AUTO REACQ position. The constraint
     still remains if we don't want to be on an OMNI
     antenna at the same time. We are in the AUTO
     REACQ position; we should be in one or the
     other. So you can use that information if you
     want to try it out. Otherwise, the procedures
     you've been using all along will be just fine.
     Over.

[01:09:15:41]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. I am transmitting in the
     blind right now. Our downlink isn't working
     so well; I'm just going ahead on an uplink.

[01:09:20:00]
CDR: Houston, do you read? Apollo 8.

[01:09:20:03]
CC: Apollo 8, read you weak but clear now.

[01:09:20:08]
CDR: Roger. Thank you.

[01:09:20:10]
CC: Okay. Looks like we had a ground problem there.

[01:09:20:18]
CDR: Roger.

[01:09:33:31]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:09:33:34]
CDR: Go ahead.

[01:09:33:38]
CC: - okay. Looks like we're - -

[01:09:33:39]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[01:09:33:40]
CC: - - Looks like we're in a good attitude to try
     this high-gain antenna on the COMM check one
     more time. I believe you're still on an OMNI.
     Is that correct?

[01:09:33:52]
_page : 2
CDR: Roger.

[01:09:33:55]
CC: Okay. If we could try the high gain and maybe
     we can get started on this COMM check. I'd also
     like to verify that you've got the LMP and the
     CMP trying to get some sleep here, and we could
     use an oral temp from you, too.

[01:09:34:16]
CDR: Roger. My temperature is 97.5.

[01:09:34:20]
CC: Okay. Thank you.

[01:09:34:24]
CDR: That's what it was this morning when I felt badly.

[01:09:34:26]
CC: Alright; thank you.

[01:09:35:24]
CDR: Do you want me to go to OMNI now, Ken?

[01:09:35:26]
CC: I'd like for you to go to high gain.

[01:09:35:28]
CDR: High gain?

[01:09:35:29]
CC: Yes, sir.

[01:09:35:33]
CDR: High gain.

[01:09:35:40]
CDR: This is Apollo 8 on high gain.

[01:09:35:44]
CC: Roger. Reading you kind of weak now, but we're
     gonna take a look at it.

[01:09:36:24]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8 on high gain.

[01:09:36:27]
CC: Okay. I'm reading you loud with just a little
     background noise.

[01:09:36:33]
CDR: Roger.

[01:09:39:24]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We're not getting a good lock.
     I wonder if we could try making sure that we're in
     AUTO on the tracks and that we're in narrow beam
     width?

[01:09:39:39]
_page : 3
CDR: Standby.

[01:09:40:00]
CDR: How's that, Houston?

[01:09:40:04]
CC: Okay. That works reel good.

[01:09:42:07]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. What we're doing right
     now is collecting baseline data, and we'll be in
     this mode for another couple of minutes and then
     we'll be moving out to the second signal.

[01:09:43:55]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read?

[01:09:44:22]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:09:44:27]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8. Read you five-by.

[01:09:44:30]
CC: Okay. We are ... we have some ground problems,
     and we're reading you weak but clear. We're
     ready to start into our test. We're going to be
     changing our modes so you'll probably hear a
     burst of noise as we make the change. This
     will be a noise that sounds like an S-band onlock.
     However, your AEC leader will lock that off.
     This is due to the loss of modulation on the uplink.
     There will be about 2 minutes, and during
     this time, you will hear one burst of noise.

[01:09:45:39]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Voice check. Over.

[01:09:45:57]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Ready to check.

[01:09:46:20]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:09:46:38]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:09:46:43]
_page : 4
LMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[01:09:46:48]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. Do you read?

[01:09:46:53]
LMP: That's affirmative.

[01:09:46:54]
CC: Okay. Thank you. Were you reading all along?
     We just - This is the first time we've heard you
     call back.

[01:09:47:02]
LMP: We've been reading you; we're trying to hold the
     noise down so we can get some sleep.

[01:09:47:09]
CC: Roger. We'll be through with this in just a
     minute, I think.

[01:09:47:13]
LMP: Roger. I will answer you, but I'll try to do
     it quietly.

[01:09:47:18]
CC: Okay, Bill.

[01:09:47:45]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. The next portion of our test is
     like we did yesterday; We'll be changing the
     uplink modes to uplink command and ranging with
     no upvoice. We'll be in this mode for approximately
     2 and 1/2 minutes and send two test messages.
     During this time, we will not have uplink.
     We are going to this mode at time 33:48:30, and
     we'll be back in this configuration at 33:50:00.
     Over.

[01:09:50:59]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check.

[01:09:51:05]
LMP: Loud and clear, Houston.

[01:09:51:07]
CC: Okay, fine. How about telemetry inputs PCM switch
     to LOW, please?

[01:09:51:17]
_page : 5
LMP: They're in LOW, Houston.

[01:09:51:24]
CC: Roger.

[01:09:52:53]
CC: Apollo 8, we've completed the third test; we're
     going into the final test now. PCM switch to
     HIGH, please.

[01:09:54:01]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We're going to switch uplink
     to the upvoice backup for about 2 minutes, and
     may take a few seconds to link the transition.
     And we'll be back up at 33:56 in our normal
     mode to place the up-telemetry data switch to
     upvoice backup at this time. Over.

[01:09:54:28]
LMP: Roger.

[01:09:55:54]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston on backup voice.

[01:09:56:00]
LMP: Loud and clear, Houston.

[01:09:56:02]
CC: Okay, fine; thank you.

[01:09:56:21]
CC: Apollo 8, let's go back up-telemetry data
     switch to DATA.

[01:09:57:12]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:09:57:29]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:09:58:56]
CC: Stand by; guess we've got 85-foot site voice
     back now; the noise went away.

[01:09:59:02]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:09:59:10]
LMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[01:09:59:17]
LMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[01:09:59:19]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. That completes our COMM test.
     Thanks for your cooperation. And I've got a
     change here to NAV sightings that will come up
     at 32:20. And we want to change your star a
     little bit there. Are you ready to copy?

[01:09:59:38]
_page : 6
LMP: Ready to copy.

[01:09:59:40]
CC: Okay.

[01:09:59:41]
LMP: Ready to copy.

[01:09:59:43]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. We would like to change the
     NAV sighting as follows: we would like to use
     star 26, that is, two-six; we would like to
     make it earth-near horizon for two sets, two sets.
     Then we would like to take star 16 earth-far
     horizon, one set. If star 26 earth-near horizon
     56 not possible, star 16 earth-far horizon, one
     set, and star 22 earth-far horizon, one set.
     Over.

[01:10:00:36]
CDR: Roger, Houston. Be advised the CMP is asleep
     ... putting those on for a while.

[01:10:00:45]
CC: Okay. Stand by.

[01:10:01:34]
CC: Apollo 8, okay; we can put this off. What we will
     probably need from you is some kind of an estimate
     of when you think somebody will be available
     to work on it, and we are working on how much
     lead time we need now.

[01:10:01:56]
LMP: Stand by ...

[01:10:01:58]
CC: Roger.

[01:10:02:08]
_page : 7
CDR: Houston, why don't you figure the CMP will sleep
     another couple of hours, then the LMP, and then
     the CDR up to about 43 hours equally. Over.

[01:10:02:20]
CC: Okay.

[01:10:02:25]
CDR: Then we will start off with the CMP again at
     about 44.

[01:10:06:58]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:10:07:03]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[01:10:07:05]
CC: Okay. We can put off this NAV sighting. It was
     scheduled here at 34:20, and we can put it off,
     Judging from your comments about sleeping, we
     would like to get it as soon as we can, and
     right now, our plans are to slide it 2 hours.
     We will do the P52 by sliding it back to the same
     thing since it is associated with the P23. So
     If that's a convenient time for you, why we will
     plan on that.

[01:10:07:38]
CDR: We are doing the P52 now. Do you want us to
     continue?

[01:10:07:43]
CC: Well, as far as we are concerned, that isn't
     going to help us any. We will have to do it
     over again anyhow.

[01:10:07:54]
CDR: Okay. And what time do you want to do it?

[01:10:07:57]
CC: Well, if you think Jim's going to be up in a
     couple of hours, why that will slide us 2 hours
     to 36:20.

[01:10:08:08]
_page : 8
CDR: Okay. We will go ahead and make another one there
     and pick it up then if that's okay.

[01:10:08:12]
CC: Okay. That will be real fine. Thank you.

[01:10:08:17]
CDR: What we are going to try to do is get back on
     the sleep cycle to those sleep periods just prior
     to LOI by taking shorter cycles for each man.

[01:10:08:29]
CC: Real fine.

[01:10:13:52]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[01:10:13:57]
CC: Apollo 8, go ahead.

[01:10:14:01]
CDR: How about giving us some REACQ angles, and we'll.
     stay in REACQ.

[01:10:14:05]
CC: Say again, please.

[01:10:14:11]
CDR: Could you give us some REACQ angles?

[01:10:14:14]
CC: Wilco.

[01:10:14:24]
CDR: Say again.

[01:10:14:29]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. I hadn't said anything
     at that time. We're digging some angles
     out for you now. In reference to your earlier
     question about the sleep cycle juggling and so
     forth: we agree with your comment. We would
     like to get back on the flight plan as far as
     the sleep cycles and so forth are concerned by
     the time we get into lunar orbit. So we'd like
     for you to use your own judgment about the most
     efficient way to accommodate the sleep cycles and
     proportion it up among yourselves. We would like
     to have you keep us informed of who's doing what
     and what your plans are. We have the one P23 that
     we had slipped 2 hours. We'd like to get the
     other one in. We can also adjust the time for
     the other P23, if it's going to conflict - I
     guess that's two more P23's. We can adjust the
     time for those if you'll let us know what your
     forecast is for when Jim will be available to
     take some sightings. So the big message is that
     we'd like to work around whatever your desires
     are. If you'll let us know, we'll pick some stars
     and some angles and have them ready for you.

[01:10:15:44]
_page : 9
CDR: Okay, Houston. The CMP will be up at 36 hours.
     The LMP is going to sleep now, and he'll sleep
     through until 40 and then I'll stagger that in
     and try to go to sleep around 30 to 37 so
     that by the time we get to day 3 we'll all be
     back on the same direct sleep cycle.

[01:10:16:12]
CC: Okay, real fine. Thank you.

[01:10:16:28]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. REACQ angles look like minus
     45 in pitch, plus 90 in yaw, and 34:23 for the
     time.

[01:10:16:41]
CDR: Roger. Copy. This is good using REACQ because
     it keeps the caution and warning from going off again.

[01:10:16:48]
CC: Roger. I understand that. Are you leaving the
     high-gain antenna on after it swings over to
     the reset position?

[01:10:17:04]
_page : 10
CDR: Do you have any reason for us to use the high-gain
     antenna?

[01:10:17:10]
F: EECOM, do you think we need that, really, very
     much?

[01:10:17:13]
CC: Standby.

[01:10:17:15]
F: Why can we just not use the high-gain antenna
     for a while? Getting high bit rate on the OMNI's.
     Okay, let's tell them that we'll just not worry
     about the OMNI for a while.

[01:10:18:30]
LMP: Houston, this is the LMP. Before I hit the sack,
     could you give me a rundown on our systems the way
     you see them?

[01:10:18:37]
CC: Okay, we'll put that together for you and we
     were just talking about the redundant ECS components
     check and we were going to put that off
     until everybody's had a chance to get some sleep.
     Trying to keep you from having going to the
     left-hand couch.

[01:10:18:54]
LMP: Oh, that would be nice. I sent Lovell under the
     couch, though. I've got one man sleeping under
     the left couch here - right couch and one man
     sleeping on our right couch.

[01:10:19:33]
CC: Okay. I understand you've got one under and
     one on the right couch.

[01:10:19:39]
LMP: Roger. That's affirmed.

[01:10:19:41]
_page : 11
CC: Okay. And in reference to the OMNI versus the
     high gain, it looks like we can live with the OMNI
     antennas here for several more hours, if you would
     like to delete the use of the high gain.

[01:10:20:10]
LMP: Okay. Goodnight, Houston.

[01:10:20:16]
CC: Okay. Before you pitch your eyeballs there, we'd
     like to terminate the battery charge.

[01:10:20:25]
LMP: I knew you guys would get me.

[01:10:20:27]
CC: Got you.

[01:10:20:35]
LMP: Okay. The battery A charge is terminated at
     37.3 volts.

[01:10:20:41]
CC: Okay. Thank you.

[01:10:20:54]
LMP: Standing by for your systems status.

[01:10:20:56]
CC: Okay. We're pulling that together now.

[01:10:21:01]
LMP: How are the PU valve and SPS line temps looking?

[01:10:21:05]
CC: Okay, I'll test that.

[01:10:21:06]
LMP: We just had ... I understand.

[01:10:25:53]
LMP: Systems look okay to you Houston?

[01:10:26:09]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. All the systems - giving a quick
     look around the room - look real fine. You've
     got an RCS quad update on the quantity, so you
     have that information. The SPS oxidizer feed-line
     temperature and the fuel temperature are
     both at 73 degrees. The cryo profile is running
     right on the line: Battery A - our calculations
     have 39.63 amp hours. Battery B, 37.94, and
     battery Charlie, 38.46. The COMM continues to
     be running ahead of predictions in quality end
     circuit margins. Everything else looks like
     it's real fine.

[01:10:27:06]
_page : 12
LMP: Roger. Do you expect to have a low bit rate voice
     on the DSE off the OMNI's at lunar distances?

[01:10:27:23]
CC: That's negative on DSE off the OMNI's. Not
     looking forward to that much improvement.

[01:10:27:32]
LMP: Roger. We need about a 30-foot dish, I figure,
     for that on the spacecraft.

[01:10:27:47]
CC: Roger. It runs up the fuel required for PTC,
     though, Bill.

[01:10:27:56]
LMP: Roger.

[01:10:39:36]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:10:39:40]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston, Apollo 8.

[01:10:39:42]
CC: Okay. I know you're trying to be quiet, so I'll
     just read up some information to you. One of
     the things that we just turned up that might give
     you some confidence, if you lose oxygen cryo tank
     now: you have 80 pounds remaining now at CM/SM
     SEP. The limiting factor on single tank operation
     right now is the hydrogen tank which has a
     positive margin at CM/SM SEP, assuming our standard
     profile gives you about 143 hours. So it looks
     like you are over the hill on those. Notice that
     you're flying in the rate 2 position for you BMAGS
     which is fine. Only make sure that you still
     were maintaining a PTC attitude. Looks like
     you're pretty close to it.

[01:10:40:41]
_page : 13
_tape : Tape 24.
CDR: Roger. We are flying PTC, and I was wondering
     why it was going out of the deadband; now I know.
     Thank you.

[01:10:40:47]
CC: Okay. Thank you.

[01:10:40:51]
CDR: That's what happens when you let Anders fly.
     He's asleep so he can't defend himself.

[01:10:41:12]
CC: Roger. But we've got it on tape though.

[01:10:41:17]
CDR: Good. They're both conked out; how about just
     filling me in on some news, and I'll keep quiet
     just to give me some words on what's going on in
     the world.

[01:10:41:34]
CC: Okay. Give me a few minutes to collect some
     data, and we'll do that.

     Is that affirm?

[01:11:28:26]

     is too low in the mud.

[01:11:28:32]

     to transmit before.

[01:11:30:31]
_page : 4

[01:11:30:32]

     and they acknowledged our transmission.

CC: Apollo 8. Houston.

[01:11:30:43]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[01:11:30:45]
CC: Okay. We got back together again. You're loud
     and clear. We've been reading you. We have a
     problem down here on the ground getting our
     signal from MCC out to remote site.

[01:11:31:01]
CDR: Roger. Understand.

[01:11:32:12]
CC: Apollo 8. Houston. I've got a ball score for
     you. It was Oakland 41, Kansas City 6 is the
     final score. That's 41 to 6, Oakland. We're
     trying to get some news releases over here for
     you. I suspect we're going to find that the
     staged TV show was probably the biggest news
     of the day.

[01:11:32:20]
CDR: I'm sorry that the TV lens broke down.

[01:11:32:26]
CC: Well, we're working on that some more. I'm
     not sure that the whole thing is lost yet. It
     appears that our problem is one where the light
     intensity which is sensed by our light meter
     in there is picking up an average field which
     is much larger than the earth, and so it's sensing
     a great deal of deep space environment which
     is dark, and we're suspicious that this is probably
     opening up the lens aperture as wide as it
     will go, and then when you point the camera at
     the earth while the earth is only filling about
     3 degrees of cone angle, whereas lens takes in
     9. So it looks like you're probably just saturating
     the tube. Now we're playing around now
     with some --

[01:11:33:14]
_page : 5
CDR: We just lost you again, Houston.

[01:11:33:16]
CC: Say again.

[01:11:33:20]
CDR: I just lost your last transmission; you were
     clipped.

[01:11:33:24]
CC: 04. Did you get any of my comments about the
     TV tube?

[01:11:33:33]
CDR: Roger. Got them.

[01:11:33:35]
CC: Okay. What I - what we've got in mind here is
     that we are looking at some of the lenses you
     have on board for cameras, and we are going to
     see if one of them can possibly be used to attenuate
     some of this light so that you will be
     able to take one of these pictures, and we are
     running some tests now, and we'll let you know
     about those. I also have a maneuver PAD that
     I need to read up to you whenever it's convenient.

[01:11:34:04]
CDR: Let me get a pencil. Be fine right now.

     the 52 option and start on the cislunar navigation.

[01:11:48:43]

[01:11:54:02]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[01:11:54:05]
CC: Okay. When you pick up your activities, I have
     a preferred alignment here that I want you to be
     in when you do your P52, and I'll have about
     four items to change on your time lines, so if
     you give me a call when you're ready for it.

[01:11:54:23]
CDR: We're ready right now. We were doing the P52.
     You want to hold off and go to a particular
     alignment, is that right?

[01:11:54:32]
CC: Affirmative.

[01:11:54:33]
CDR: All right. I'm ready.

[01:11:54:35]
CC: Okay. The attitude is pitch 23.4, roll 184.7,
     yaw 14.3. And the reason we're doing the alignment
     in this attitude is, the next thing we'll
     be coming up with is the scanning telescope visibility
     test and that will be 70 degrees sun
     and Arcturus with a shaft and trunnion of zero.
     and then we can go ahead with the P52 and then
     a trunnion bias followed by P23 with the same
     stars we read to you before.

[01:11:55:24]
_page : 9

CC: All right. Thank you.

[01:12:09:45]
CDR: Houston, we've reached the preferred attitude,
     and we're proceeding with the P52.

[01:12:09:49]
CC: Okay. Real fine, and I'll pass up some advice
     from your friendly flight surgeon. He says
     you're supposed to take one more Lomotil.

[01:12:10:03]

[01:12:13:20]
CMP: Houston, the P52 is completed. We're ready for
     your other data.

[01:12:13:28]
CC: Okay. Understand that you've done the P52. The
     next item on the flight plan should be a scanning
     telescope visibility test, and this is the same
     one that was on your flight plan previously at
     34 hours and about 12 minutes, and we'll be
     checking that 70 degree sun's on Arcturus. Following
     that, we need to make a trunnion bias
     check, and then we'll go into a P23, and I can
     read you those star numbers and sets if you
     don't have them from the last time I read them
     up.

[01:12:14:13]
_page : 10
CMP: Okay. Standby.

[01:12:14:20]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[01:12:14:22]
CC: Go ahead.

[01:12:14:26]
CMP: Roger. With such good visibility or such good
     communications, we'll just give you a verbal
     description without seeing the scanning telescope
     right now. Your angles for maneuvering
     to Arcturus were quite good. I've got
     Arcturus centered in the scanning telescope.
     At this sun angle, there is a shaft of light
     directly across the center of the scanning telescope
     and - band of light. It precludes seeing
     alot of stars around us, and although I
     kept my eye glued to the telescope now for
     some time, it's very difficult to see any star
     patterns or anything. I couldn't recognize
     that with Arcturus unless I - the optics just
     drove me there. Now because I'm near zero
     shaft and zero trunnion, I'm getting quite a
     bit of shaft movement. Everytime the shaft
     moves, more particles leave the optics, and
     they're just as bright as the surrounding stars.
     And they mingle in the stars, and you can't
     tell star patterns or constellations. With
     this particular attitude, the shaft of light
     precludes any identification of constellations
     or individual stars.

[01:12:15:47]
_page : 11
CC: Okay. Copy that. Can you tell us something
     about the orientation of this band? You mentioned
     that last night also - that you also had
     a band about 10 degrees wide that ran across.
     Is there an orientation that we can tie that to?

[01:12:16:05]
CMP: I believe so, Ken. This band is parallel to
     the M-line, and I think it has something to do
     with the design of the optics where we have
     that shaft or the rectangular entrance of the
     optics from the outside. At this particular
     sun angle, it cuts right across. Now I noticed
     that both the earth and the sun do this to the
     scanning telescope. In the sextant, the same
     light band is there, although it covers the
     entire sextant's field of view. However, the
     magnification brings out the stars quite well,
     and it is possible to mark on it. But the
     identification of the stars with the scanning
     telescope makes it very difficult. Now the
     attitude that I found the optics are best at
     are the attitudes which give the constellations
     Canis Major and Orion in the scanning telescope.
     At this, this particular attitude of the
     spacecraft, the band is gone; we're at a position
     whereby the sun is behind us, and I can
     see quite a few stars. Now yesterday I could
     also, after getting dark-adapted, see quite a
     few stars around the constellation Cassiopeia
     which at first I couldn't. But right now this
     band precludes you see anything at all except Arcturus
     which, of course, I know we're aiming at right
     now.

[01:12:17:34]
_page : 12
CC: Okay. Thank you very much.

[01:12:18:08]
CDR: Ken, what stars did you want to use? Did you
     want to read them off?

[01:12:18:12]
CC: Okay. First star will be 26, and we'll be making
     two sets of measurements, earth near-horizon
     using star 26. Then we would like to have one
     set on star 16, that's 16, using the earth far-horizon.
     If it turns out that star 26 earth
     near-horizon is not possible, then we'd like to
     have star 16 on the earth far-horizon for one
     set, and star 22 earth far-horizon one set.
     Over.

[01:12:19:04]
CDR: You want star 26, earth near-horizon, two sets;
     star 16, earth far-horizon, one set; and star 22,
     earth far-horizon, one set.

[01:12:19:18]
_page : 13
CC: Okay. That's star 22 only in the event that 26
     on the earth's near horizon is not possible?
     Over.

[01:12:19:27]
CDR: We won't even do star 22 then unless we can't
     get 26 on the near horizon.

[01:12:19:31]
CC: That's affirmative.

[01:12:20:25]
LMP: COMM sure is good all of a sudden, isn't it?

[01:12:20:28]
CC: Yes, this is outstanding.

[01:12:50:54]
CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8.

[01:12:50:57]
CDR: Okay, we have completed two sets on 26 and one
     set on 16.

[01:12:51:02]
CC: Roger. Getting pretty speedy there.

[01:12:51:08]
CDR: Jim is getting to know the objects.

[01:12:51:11]
CMP: Are you receiving the data, Houston?

[01:12:51:13]
CC: Affirmative.

[01:12:51:16]
CMP: Okay.

[01:12:51:19]
CC: Keeping you honest.

[01:12:51:23]
CMP: Right.

[01:12:51:40]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. We have looked at the data and
     it looks good and they feel like you can go back
     to PTC attitude anytime you are ready to. And if
     you can - go ahead.

[01:12:51:56]
CDR: What attitude do you want to use? The same one?

[01:12:52:00]
CC: That's affirmative.

[01:12:52:04]
CDR: Thank you.

[01:12:52:05]
CC: Okay, if you can reach over Bill there and get
     to panel 3, I believe we would like to cycle the
     oxygen fans. And also like to get the BIOMED
     switch over to CMP.

[01:12:52:24]
CDR: Okay.

[01:12:52:27]
CC: If you have to bother Bill to do that, why, we can
     hold off on the cryo fans.

[01:12:52:31]
CDR: No, he moved. We already chased him under the
     seat. Okay, now you want just the oxygen fans on?

[01:12:52:38]
_page : 2
CC: That's affirm. Turn one on for about 2 minutes
     and when we turn it off, then we will turn the
     next one on. We don't want to turn them on
     simultaneously though.

[01:12:52:49]
CDR: I know that. I mean you don't want hydrogen
     though?

[01:12:52:53]
CC: That's affirmative. Just the oxygen.

[01:12:54:12]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[01:12:54:16]
CC: Go ahead.

[01:12:54:20]
CMP: Ken, just recap a little explanation here on your
     maneuver PAD, something which I'm really not
     knowledgeable about, the way it was presented to
     us, you mentioned fast return P37 DELTA-V of 8750,
     just briefly clarify that, will you please?

[01:12:54:42]
CC: Okay, stand by.

[01:12:57:43]
CDR: Ken, can you give us a little report on how our
     trajectory looks and the tracking is going and
     things like that?

[01:12:57:50]
CC: Okay, sure will. I will put a summary together
     here.

[01:12:57:55]
CDR: And the pericynthian sign.

[01:12:57:57]
CC: Roger, we will get all that together for you in
     just a few minutes.

[01:12:58:01]
CDR: And we never did get the news.

[01:12:58:05]
CC: You are the news.

[01:12:58:09]
CDR: Come off it, come off it.

[01:12:58:41]
_page : 3
CDR: Okay, the fans have been cycled 2 minutes each
     and they are back off.

[01:12:58:45]
CC: Okay, thank you very much.

[01:13:06:07]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8 is back in the PTC attitude,
     reads MHPTC.

[01:13:06:12]
CC: Okay, thank you. And in reference to your question
     about the P37 DELTA-V, 8750, that's the
     number that goes into the option at P37 for your
     minimum time return. That gives you a target for
     the Indian Ocean. And in this case, we are going
     to have to use the high-speed procedures that were
     worked out for you to use some minus number for
     the major axis.

[01:13:06:47]
CMP: Roger. Understand. I'm going to give that a try,
     Ken, in a run through. I tried it yesterday, I
     wasn't getting too much in the way of results. I
     will give it a try today.

[01:13:07:02]
CC: Okay. And on the - your tracking that we have
     now, it still looks like the time we gave you last
     night for time of pericynthian is still good, 69 plus
     10 and right now your flyby earth pericynthian
     altitude is 65.8. Looks like the midcourse number
     3 is going to be something less than 1 foot-per-second.
     And all trajectory parameters are still
     holding real fine.

[01:13:07:36]
CDR: That's the things we like to hear. We would like
     to keep those holding very much.

[01:13:07:45]
_page : 4
CC: Roger.

[01:13:21:00]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[01:13:21:04]
CC: Go ahead.

[01:13:21:08]
CDR: Roger. We're getting near - we're going to need
     to dump some urine overboard here. I wonder if
     that's going to foul your trajectory up. Or can
     we go ahead and do it?

[01:13:21:18]
CC: No, that's okay. Something that is kind of
     interesting though is that the last time you had
     your water dump, they noticed a change in the
     trajectory tracking at the same time and they got
     through correlating it, they found some fellow
     that thought he knew the characteristics of a
     nozzle and how much water you're dumping and his
     estimates of the effect on the trajectory seemed
     to coincide with the tracked results. So I guess
     you have to stay onto some of those things.

[01:13:21:51]
CDR: Roger. Okay. We'll go ahead and dump it.

[01:13:21:55]
CC: Okay.

[01:13:23:29]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[01:13:23:31]
CC: Roger. Go ahead.

[01:13:23:35]
CMP: You planning on using our computer any time in
     the near future, I thought I'd do a little P37.

[01:13:24:50]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. You can go ahead and run that
     37 and we'll going to kind of watch that from the
     ground, too, and see how it works out. A couple
     of items that are just of general interest in
     the trajectory world. Looks like the uncertainty
     in position was about 12 miles. Your uncertainty
     in velocity is about a quarter of a foot per
     second. And the perigee altitude of uncertainty
     is 5 miles.

[01:13:25:26]
_page : 5
CMP: Roger. Understand. Just for information, perhaps
     you read it out on the ground. I ran our pericynthian
     altitude determination using first of all,
     P21. The star state vector that we navigated with,
     we have plus 84.7 mile altitude and then we ran
     out your state vector that you updated with us the
     last time. We got 64.2 and then I ran P30, using
     our state vector and got 82.6 nautical miles.
     These are all plus.

[01:13:26:02]
CC: That's good.

[01:13:26:14]
CMP: What I'm going to attempt to do on P37 is to
     input your DELTA-V on your TLI plus 44 and use that
     44 burn time. I notice that the entry velocity
     is a little high. We might not be able to do a
     normal P37, but we'll give it a try.

[01:13:26:35]
CC: Roger.

[01:13:27:36]
CMP: Houston, one more question then before I start.
     Did you notice on this last update PAD, this
     minus MA NC-1. Was that referring to the P37 fast
     return or the nominal maneuver which you gave me?

[01:13:27:52]
_page : 6
CC: Apollo 8, that's referring to the fast return
     procedures.

[01:13:27:58]
LMP: Okay. Thank you.

[01:13:31:55]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[01:13:31:57]
CC: Go ahead.

[01:13:32:00]
CMP: Are you following my procedure?

[01:13:32:02]
CC: That's affirmative.

[01:13:32:06]
CMP: Okay. This happened yesterday, too. I'm trying
     to load the DELTA-V you gave us in the maneuver
     TLI plus 44 in P37, but I keep getting an operator
     error everytime I try to load zeros for the
     termination of the middle and corner. Do you
     know what I'm doing wrong in my procedure?

[01:13:32:31]
CC: Okay. Stand by.

[01:13:35:24]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:13:35:28]
CMP: Okay, go ahead. I can take it.

[01:13:35:31]
CC: Okay, looks like the decimal point in R2 under
     NOUN 60 is on the extreme right-hand side so the
     proper load will be 06070. Over.

[01:13:35:46]
CMP: Ah, so. Okay, fine. Thank you. I'll update
     my checklist. Don't know what I want to update
     it for, I can't read.

[01:13:54:24]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We are about to hand over
     to another site so you may lose lock momentarily.

[01:13:54:36]
CMP: Roger, Houston. Did you receive the results of
     the P37?

[01:13:54:40]
_page : 7
CC: Sure did. Looks pretty good here.

[01:13:54:45]

     right now. We are passing the - we have the
     roll of about 182; we're about in 226 pitch and
     18 in yaw. I can rotate the shaft all the way
     around at this particular attitude, and I get
     this band of light at about 10 degrees of this
     side of the M-line. It - it varies in intensity
     with the shaft position. However, it is there
     at this particular attitude.

[01:13:59:06]
CC: Okay. Thank you.

[01:13:59:32]
CC: Jim, we have just been looking at your marks
     with respect to accuracy and they figure they
     are within a couple of thousandths of a degree

[01:16:02:29]
CC: Okay. The big news right now, on the wires, is
     that all 82 crewmen of the Pueblo have been returned.
     They walked across the Bridge of Freedom
     Monday night.

[01:16:02:42]
CDR: Wonderful!

[01:16:02:48]
CC: Said it took about 30 minutes for all 82 men
     to come across the Bridge of No Return and that's
     the one separating North and South Korea. They
     started across about 11:30 a.m. and were over
     by about noon, and they brought the body of the
     crewman that was killed, also.

[01:16:03:17]
CC: Okay, Frank. On ball scores, did you get the
     word on the Baltimore and Minnesota game today?

[01:16:03:24]
CDR: Not the final one.

[01:16:03:26]
CC: Okay. Final score was the Colts 24, Vikings 14.
     That gives them the western conference, so it
     looks like for the NFL title it's gonna be the
     Browns versus the Colts on the 29th.

[01:16:03:41]

[01:16:03:53]
CC: Roger. Come back slow return and we'll get it.

[01:16:03:58]
CDR: I'd rather come back fast and watch it on television.

[01:16:04:02]
CC: Atta boy! Let's see, for the AFL: the big game
     today was Oakland and Kansas City and Oakland
     dumped them 41 to 6, so it's looks the AFL title
     game will be the Raiders and Jets.

[01:16:04:17]
CDR: Righto! That's hard to believe, that score.

[01:16:04:20]
CC: Amen! Okay. In yesterday's game, I don't know
     it you got the score on that. The Cleveland
     Browns and the Cowboys. The Browns dumped the
     Cowboys 31 to 20.

[01:16:04:34]
CDR: Yes, we heard that.

[01:16:04:36]
CC: Yes, they're crying in Dallas. Basketball scores:
     Houston didn't do so good this weekend. Illinois
     beat Houston 97 to 84. And North Carolina took
     the Owls. The score was 85 to 77. We had a
     couple of words in the paper, Frank, on the
     Oilers. The Oilers voted George Webster their
     most valuable player and - although Houston didn't
     make anybody on the All Offensive Team this year,
     they put Walt Suggs and Hoyle Granger on the
     second team.

[01:16:05:40]
_page : 3
CDR: Very good.

[01:16:05:48]
CC: But although the Oilers didn't do so well out on
     the field, they did great in the box office.
     Bud Adams, Don Klausterman and Wally Lemm were
     all - real pleased with it. By the way, they
     were at the Cape to watch the show. Houston in
     11 games - the Oilers attracted 460 628 people.

[01:16:06:12]
CDR: That must be a record? For them? I don't
     believe they ever got that many in Rice Stadium.

[01:16:06:23]
CC: I think so. Let's see the regular season attendance
     was about half that. This includes all
     the exhibition games. The paper says they averaged
     about 40 480 for the league games.

[01:16:06:38]
CDR: Great!

[01:16:06:45]
CC: Well, that's about it for now, Frank. We got
     some more news that they promised they would
     bring over as soon as it comes off the wire.
     The only thing of real interests were - particularly
     the Pueblo release. I think you've already
     been told about the - Nixon-Eisenhower wedding.
     And about the only other thing is the weather
     which is pretty clear around here. We've got
     high overcasts. But it is cold, good visibility,
     and it's beginning to feel like winter again.

[01:16:07:20]
CDR: Good time for Christmas, good weather for Christmas.

[01:16:07:37]
CC: Who have you got up now, Frank?

[01:16:07:41]
_page : 11
CDR: The other two guys are pretty sleepy. They
     sacked out again. So I am holding the fort
     down for a while.

[01:16:07:48]
CC: Okay. Thanks.

[01:16:07:52]
CDR: Roger. Thank you.

[01:16:08:00]
CC: Frank, we had a little egg nog over at Charlie
     Duke's tonight.

[01:16:08:03]
CDR: Say again.

[01:16:08:04]
CC: We had a little egg nog at Charlie Duke's tonight.
     Val Anders dropped by. She's looking fine.
     Tell Bill she's doing real fine.

[01:16:08:14]
CDR: Fine.

[01:16:08:43]
CDR: How do you like shift work, Jerry?

[01:16:08:51]
CC: It's great Frank. You've got the black watch
     watching you tonight.

[01:16:08:56]
CDR: Yes, that's what I figured.

[01:16:11:17]
CDR: Boy, Jerry. That earth is sure looking small.

[01:16:11:25]
CC: Roger. I guess it'll get smaller, too.

[01:16:11:33]
CDR: Yes, we're getting along pretty good, though, now.

[01:16:11:36]
CC: Real good. It looks like you're approaching
     150 000 miles.

[01:16:11:42]
CDR: Roger.

[01:16:11:48]
CC: How does the moon look, Frank?

[01:16:11:52]
CDR: Say again.

[01:16:11:53]
CC: Have you looked at the moon lately?

[01:16:11:57]
CDR: No. I saw it yesterday, but we haven't seen it
     today.

[01:16:12:51]
_page : 5
CC: Frank, you've probably already been told this,
     but you looked great on TV today. One little
     homey item, though. In the El Lago area you were
     upstaged by Santa Claus. He came along on a
     fire engine just about the time you guys came
     along. So most of the little critters were all
     outside.

[01:16:13:10]
CDR: That's good. I wish we could have got that one
     lens working. I'd like to share the view here
     we have of the earth.

[01:16:13:20]
CC: Frank, we've got some guys looking at it. We
     might be able to find a way to make it work for
     you. Hopefully, by a couple of hours before
     TV time tomorrow, we'll have an answer.

[01:16:13:31]
CDR: Very good.

[01:16:13:32]
CC: Jack Schmitt is working with us, too.

[01:16:13:39]
CDR: Very good.

[01:16:13:41]
CC: Ah, Jack Schmitt's working with it, too.

[01:16:13:43]
CDR: Very good. That's Typhoid Jack.

[01:16:13:44]
CC: (Laughter)

[01:16:14:06]
CDR: This COMM so good we don't figure we'll
     have much to debrief.

[01:16:14:13]
CC: Roger. Probably the biggest part of the
     debrief will be the medical part.

[01:16:14:26]
CDR: Roger. You're sure right. Oh, we're all in
     fine shape.

[01:16:14:45]

     is going to be like in the recovery area on Friday.

[01:17:38:03]
CC: Roger, Frank.

[01:17:44:52]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston, with a weather watch.

[01:17:45:02]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[01:17:45:04]
CC: Roger, Frank. For 7 degrees, 38 minutes north,
     165 west landing area, we are showing 2000
     scattered, 12 000 broken, high over at 10; the
     wind's from the east at 12, 4-foot swells, about
     an 82 degree temperature. There will be some
     rain showers in about 10 to 30 percent of the
     area with ceilings around 2000. If there is -
     turns out to be a thunderstorm in the area, it
     will probably have a ceiling around 500 feet.

[01:17:47:02]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Did you copy that weather okay?

[01:17:47:05]
CDR: Roger. I said thank you. Do you read me now?

[01:17:47:07]
CC: Roger. Reading you much better. We got the voice
     coming down through Honeysuckle now.

     is a little drowsy.

[01:17:59:01]

[01:18:45:00]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go.

[01:18:45:04]
CDR: Roger. The cabin temperature is down to
     60, and it's getting pretty chilly in here.
     Have you got any approved solutions on how to
     bring it up without stirring up this nice
     thermal balance we have?

[01:18:45:15]
CC: Roger. Stand by.

[01:18:46:01]
CC: Frank, do you have your cabin fans on?

[01:18:46:05]
CDR: Negative.

[01:18:46:06]
CC: Roger.
     01118 46 08 CDR We haven't had them on since we separated.

[01:18:46:14]

CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:18:56:26]
CDR: Go ahead.

[01:18:56:28]
CC: Roger, Frank. Midcourse number 3 looks like
     just a shade more than 1 foot per second, so
     we don't recommend that you do it. That leads
     us off into a midcourse 4 of only about 3 feet
     per second right now. Your trajectory is looking
     real good. Your height at pericynthian is
     70 miles.

[01:18:56:53]
CDR: Roger. Understand. Thank you.

[01:18:56:55]
CC: Roger. Roger, Frank. Little few thoughts on
     what is coming up now. The star sightings when
     Jim gets up; looks right now like we've had
     enough of the earth horizon, and everything
     looks real good; and we are ready to start on
     some lunar horizon sightings. So when Jim gets
     up, we will pass the flight plan update to him
     for a set of stars with the moon. Also, around 48,
     or after the star sightings is when we would like
     to see your next water dump come up. So, if you
     can, I recommend you get a little shuteye.

[01:18:57:36]
_page : 2
CDR: Roger. Have you got any answer about warming this
     place up a little bit?

[01:18:57:40]
CC: Roger. They are still cranking around. They are
     talking about cabin fans, but that sounds like
     sort of a noisy proposition.

[01:19:05:17]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:19:05:21]
CMP: Go ahead.

[01:19:05:23]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. I have got two
     methods for you to warm up the cabin there.
     The first one is a one-man job - about the
     best way would be to put one or both cabin fans ON
     and go full hot on the cabin heat exchanger.
     It'll be a fairly slow process of warming up,
     and you won't get a whole lot of heating. Your
     second method would be to adjust with the mixing
     valve your radiator OUT temperatures. This, again,
     is a two-man job, and you have to be pretty careful.

[01:19:06:03]
_page : 3
CMP: Roger. Well, Frank just went to bed, and Bill
     isn't up yet. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll
     put on the fans and go HIGH on the cabin temperature
     and see what that does.

[01:19:06:16]
CC: Okay, Jim. Remember, if you use just one fan,
     cover the other.

[01:19:06:26]
CMP: Roger.

[01:19:10:22]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[01:19:10:25]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go.

[01:19:10:30]
CMP: Roger. If I use just one fan - You mentioned
     about covering the other one - are you sure
     that's true in this spacecraft?

[01:19:10:43]
CC: Roger. That's affirmative.

[01:19:10:49]
CMP: I thought that was a BLOCK I problem.

[01:19:11:01]
CC: Stand by, Jim. We'll recheck on that one.

[01:19:11:16]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Did you get the word from
     Frank on the star-sighting plans?

[01:19:11:25]
CMP: Roger. I'll get out the flight plan if you
     have an update to it now, though, then we can
     update it right now.

[01:19:11:32]
CC: Okay.

[01:19:28:42]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:19:29:07]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:19:29:11]
CMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[01:19:29:14]
CC: Roger. Are you ready for that flight plan
     update?

[01:19:29:21]
_page : 4
CMP: Roger. Go ahead.

[01:19:29:23]
CC: Okay. At 47:15, delete the P23 sightings
     you're shoving there; and at 45 minutes -
     correction, 45 hours, add one additional
     set of sightings to each star.

[01:19:29:52]
CMP: Okay. You said at 45 hours we're going to
     add one set of sightings to each of the three
     stars. Is that correct?

[01:19:29:58]
CC: That's affirmative. Everybody's real pleased
     with the earth horizon work; and as far as
     we're concerned, you can knock that off, and
     just add one set to each one of your lunar
     horizon stars at about 45. This 45-hour time
     also is not hard. You can shift it as your -
     as you desire.

[01:19:30:25]
CMP: Roger. I see things coming up now. Jerry,
     we're going to get the block data around 44,
     and we'll do alignment around 44:30 and then
     we'll go into cislunar navigation.

[01:19:30:39]
CC: Okay. Fine, Jim. Then remember after you do
     the sightings, we'll want you to go back to
     the PTC mode again. And a little curiosity,
     how's the water tasting, and how did you sleep?

[01:19:30:57]
CMP: Water's tasting okay; no problems. And the
     sleep is getting better: We find it better to
     sleep underneath the couch now. I was up here
     with Frank, and I was dozing off periodically
     over the last several hours. Frank's now below
     and Bill's below, too.

[01:19:31:17]
_page : 5
CC: Okay, Jim; thanks.

[01:19:37:27]

[01:19:37:31]

[01:19:37:32]

     Guam to Honeysuckle coming up in about 2 and
     1/2 minutes.

[01:19:39:39]

     there is no problem in seeing stars in the

[01:19:40:29]
CC: Jim, are you talking about out the window or
     out any of the - or out the telescope?

[01:19:40:36]
CMP: I am looking out the window right now. I have
     the lights out in the spacecraft, the window
     covered where the sun is, and I can see the
     stars very well out the left rendezvous window.

[01:19:40:49]
_page : 6
CC: Okay. I guess that window is still pretty good
     for you then.

[01:19:40:55]
CMP: That's right. It is one of the few that is.
     The center window, unfortunately, is all fogged
     over; it looks like a coating of ice or coating
     of heavy fog. Bill claims it is something else,
     though.

[01:19:41:12]
CC: Roger. By the way, I am just getting OJT on
     this CAP COM job while Jerry is out of the
     room.

[01:19:41:25]
CMP: Well, we all have to learn sometime.

[01:19:41:31]
CC: Yes sir.

[01:19:41:47]
CMP: You picked a midnight shift, I see.

[01:19:41:50]
CC: Yes, it is turning out to be kind of quiet,
     too.

[01:19:41:57]
CMP: We like it that way.

[01:19:42:00]
CC: Well, things will pick up here by tomorrow
     night, I think.

[01:19:42:05]
CMP: I believe you are right.

[01:19:42:14]
CC: We're starting to show cabin temperature at
     70, so it may be warming up for you.

[01:19:42:21]
CMP: Well, we can feel it warm up. I have both
     fans on and the - our gages indicate about 70.

[01:19:42:28]

CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[01:21:14:55]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go.

[01:21:15:00]
CMP: Roger. Just some interesting things on the -
     just done a NAV with the moon; the sun is currently
     right in the way. I managed to get
     one set on Antares and was working on the
     second set, and the rim of the moon just disappeared
     completely. The view through the
     sextant is a milky white, whether you're looking
     at black sky or the moon. The tint of
     the moon is slightly washed out by the brightness
     of the sun. I'll try the next star and
     see what I can do with it.

[01:21:15:35]
CC: Roger, Jim.

[01:21:15:56]
LMP: Good morning, Houston. How are the systems
     looking here lately?

[01:21:16:02]
CC: Mornin', sleepy head. Systems are looking
     GO.

[01:21:16:11]
LMP: Thank you.

[01:21:16:34]
CC: How'd you sleep, Bill?

[01:21:16:41]
LMP: Oh, off and on, Jerry. There was quite a
     bit of noise in here, and anytime somebody
     responds to a transmission, why, it tends to
     wake you up. But it was a reasonably good
     rest.

[01:21:16:54]
CC: Real fine. We got a little work scheduled
     for you here. We've got an ECS redundant
     component check to run and some fuel cell
     purging to do.

[01:21:17:06]
_page : 2
LMP: Okay. How about if we wait until this NAV
     exercise is over with?

[01:21:17:11]
CC: Roger.

[01:21:18:23]
CC: Bill, what we have planned for you right
     after Jim gets finished is a waste water dump,
     a cryo fan cycle, redundant component check,
     and a fuel cell purge.

[01:21:18:31]
LMP: Roger.

[01:21:18:40]
CC: We'll be wanting an O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge;
     we'll give you a 20-minute hack on the heater.

[01:21:18:51]
LMP: Okay. Want me to turn them on now or when
     you give me a hack?

[01:21:18:56]
CC: You better wait about 20 minutes.

[01:21:19:01]
LMP: Okay.

[01:21:25:13]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Bill, are you still
     eating?

[01:21:25:21]
LMP: Doing what?

[01:21:25:25]
CC: Are you busy eating?

[01:21:25:26]
LMP: Negative. I'm watching the store while Jim
     does his NAV sighting and then recording the
     data for him.

[01:21:25:33]
CC: Okay. We have a correction to make to your
     TLI plus 44 hour PAD. If you've got a chance
     there, we'd like to fire it on up to you.

[01:21:25:47]
_page : 3
LMP: Stand by.

[01:21:25:50]
CC: Roger.

[01:21:26:17]
LMP: Okay. Ready to copy the correction to TLI
     plus 44.

[01:21:26:24]
CC: Roger. The correction is in the remarks at
     the end. Delete the reference to high speed
     procedure minus MA.

[01:21:26:42]
LMP: Roger. Delete minus MA slash NC-1, Charlie.

[01:21:26:49]
CC: That's affirmative, and copy the following.
     This comment should read use P37 NC-4, step 1
     through 11. Over.

[01:21:27:15]
LMP: Roger. Use P37 NC-4, steps 1 through 11.

[01:21:27:22]
CC: Roger. Then proceed to longitude control for
     no COMM procedure, page NC-7.

[01:21:27:46]
LMP: You went a little fast. Say again the page.

[01:21:27:49]
CC: Roger, That page is NC-7. I'll read that
     again. Then proceed to longitude control for
     no COMM procedure, page NC-7. Average 400k,
     V 400K, for corridor control charts is 36253.
     I repeat, average V 400K for corridor control
     charts is 36253. Over.

[01:21:28:42]
LMP: Roger. Say again. That's average G as in
     George.

[01:21:28:47]
CC: Negative. Average Victor 400K for corridor
     control chart is 36253.

[01:21:29:03]
_page : 4
LMP: Roger. Average V 400K for corridor control
     chart is 36253.

[01:21:29:11]
CC: Roger. The minus MA procedure is okay after
     abort when the GERU is less than 07990.

[01:21:30:08]
LMP: Roger. Minus MA procedure okay for abort
     when GERU less than 07990.

[01:21:30:20]
CC: Roger. I'll read back the entire remarks
     now just to make sure we got it straight.
     Use P37 NC-4, steps 1 through 11; then proceed
     to longitude control for no COMM procedure
     on page NC-7; average Victor 400K for
     corridor control chart is 36253; Minus MA
     procedure is okay after abort when GERU is

[01:21:42:31]
CC: Bill, you can turn on the H<sub>2</sub> purge line heater
     now.

[01:21:42:36]
LMP: Okay.

CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:21:47:47]
CMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[01:21:47:49]
CC: Jim, when you get a chance, either you or Bill,
     would you give us a crew status report on you
     and Bill?

[01:21:47:57]
CMP: Roger. We're going to finish up this one set
     of stars for you, then we'll do that.

[01:21:48:01]
_page : 5
CC: Okay.

[01:21:48:11]
CMP: Have you been getting this data down there
     in Houston?

[01:21:48:15]
CC: That's affirmative, Apollo 8.

[01:21:48:38]
CC: Jim, so far we've only missed one point; we'll
     ask you to read it back a little bit later.

[01:21:48:49]
LMP: Which one do you need?

[01:21:48:56]
CC: Stand by.
     END OF TAPE
     01 21 - - CC Apollo 8, Houston. What we need is the third
     mark on the first set, star 33, trunnion only.
     Over.
     ---- LMP Roger. That's the only one we're in doubt of.
     We think it was 12020.
     ---- CC Roger. Copy.
     ---- LMP Okay. That completes two for this time, Houston.
     Are you satisfied?
     ---- CC Roger, Jim.
     ---- CMP Houston, for information, the last two stars,
     34 and 40, were shot at the very tip of the lit
     rim. You practically have to imagine the rim
     continued on past where it goes into the darkness.
     ---- CC Roger. I understand they were shot at the tip
     of the lit rim.
     ---- CMP That's affirmative, and the area around the entire
     moon now, both the sky and the moon itself, are all
     a milky white because of the nearness of the sun.
     ---- CC Roger. Copying.

[01:21:53:53]
LMP: Roger, Houston. I'm heading that way now.

[01:21:53:56]
CC: Okay.

[01:22:01:33]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:22:01:37]
LMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[01:22:01:39]
_page : 2
CC: We'd like to have you start your waste water dump
     as soon as you can; dump to 20 percent. We're
     doing this in order to get 71 percent at LOI.
     Over.

[01:22:01:55]
LMP: Understand; 20 percent.

[01:22:01:58]
CC: Roger.

[01:22:14:32]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:22:14:36]
LMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[01:22:14:38]
CC: Roger. We see waste water coming down now. While
     it's on its way down, how about a cryo fan cycle?

[01:22:14:48]
CMP: Okay. Cryo fan cycle; I'll cycle H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> fans,
     one at a time, 2 minutes each.

[01:22:14:56]
CC: Roger.

[01:22:21:56]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We're showing you at 20.0 percent now.

[01:22:22:07]
LMP: Roger. We're showing about 25. We'll shut it off
     now.

[01:22:22:12]
CC: Roger. Next on deck is the fuel cell H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> purge.

[01:22:22:21]
LMP: Stand by.

[01:22:30:34]
LMP: Okay. Houston, we're ready to start the purge.

[01:22:30:38]
CC: Roger, Bill. While you're purging, can you give
     us a crew status report?

[01:22:30:49]
LMP: That's going to be O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>. Is that correct?

[01:22:30:52]
CC: Affirmative.
     01 22 31 LMP Roger. H<sub>2</sub> first, okay?

[01:22:31:07]
CC: Roger. That's okay.

[01:22:32:13]
_page : 3
LMP: We're getting H<sub>2</sub> flow, Jerry, but we don't have
     any of the - any vapor particles anywhere. Some
     are starting now.

[01:22:32:33]
CC: Roger. We confirm your flow and understand you're
     seeing particles now.

[01:22:32:42]
LMP: Not much, though. Okay. Now going to number 2.

[01:22:32:45]
CC: Roger.

[01:22:33:08]
LMP: You know, it's really too bad the side windows
     are fogged up because we never see any sun in the
     rendezvous windows, and we can't get very good
     pictures through these foggy ones.

[01:22:33:22]
CC: Roger.

[01:22:34:36]
LMP: Start number 3. H<sub>2</sub>.

[01:22:36:21]
LMP: Okay. Start number 3, O<sub>2</sub>.

[01:22:36:28]
CC: Roger, Apollo 8. Apollo 8, this is Houston.
     Would you set for ACCEPT for a P27 update, state
     vector to your LM side, and we'd like you to -

[01:22:36:46]
LMP: Say again.

[01:22:36:48]
CC: Roger, Bill. Would you set up to ACCEPT a state
     vector update? We'll be putting it in the LM
     slot, and do not unzap. Over.

[01:22:37:02]
LMP: Roger. NORMAL ACCEPT.

[01:22:37:17]
LMP: We're going to put the word "zap" back in the
     dictionary.

_page : 4
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go.

[01:22:38:27]
CMP: It might be interesting to note that after NAV
     sightings, we ran out P21, and we get a pericynthian
     now of 66.8 miles.

[01:22:38:38]
CC: Roger, 8. We copy.

[01:22:38:45]
LMP: I knew if he did it long enough, he'd finally
     get one that was close.

[01:22:39:13]
LMP: Okay. Start fuel cell 2.

[01:22:39:18]
CC: Roger.

[01:22:39:54]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Your state vector update is
     complete and verified. You can have the computer
     back in BLOCK. Over.

[01:22:40:05]
CMP: Roger.

[01:22:41:20]
LMP: Okay. Going to number 1, O<sub>2</sub>.

[01:22:41:25]
CC: Roger, Bill.

[01:22:41:28]
LMP: Old Helmut Kuehnel's kitchen timer is pretty nice.

[01:22:41:58]
CC: Roger, Bill. You can turn off your H<sub>2</sub> heaters
     now.

[01:22:42:06]
CMP: Wilco.

[01:22:43:01]
CC: Bill, we show you 168 000 out, and we're getting -
     still getting pretty good high bit rate off the
     30-foot dishes.

[01:22:43:13]
LMP: Okay. I'm in NARROW BEAM high gain now. Were
     you getting good high bit rate on the OMNI?

[01:22:43:26]
CC: That's affirmative. We're back on high gain now.

[01:22:43:39]
_page : 5
LMP: Okay. Number 1 O<sub>2</sub> is off, and will you clarify
     your previous statement. Were you getting good
     high bit rate while we were on the OMNI's about
     10 minutes ago? Over.

[01:22:43:50]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. That's affirmative. We were
     getting fairly good high bit rate with a little
     bit of noise.

[01:22:43:59]
LMP: Okay. Thank you.

[01:22:44:02]
CC: Roger. We only got two things left to do now.
     We need your crew status report and a redundant
     component check.

[01:22:44:13]
LMP: Jim will give you the latter - former,
     and I'll give you the latter.

[01:22:44:20]
CC: Okay.

[01:22:44:42]
CC: Bill, EECOM says thanks for the good job on keeping
     the OMNI's moving.

[01:22:44:54]
LMP: Roger. We'll make any sacrifice as long as they
     keep an eye on the systems.

[01:22:45:03]
CC: Wilco.

[01:22:45:10]
LMP: Who's on the watch with you?

[01:22:45:15]
CC: It's just me right now.

[01:22:45:20]
LMP: How about EECOM?

[01:22:45:22]
CC: Well, we have Clint. The Black Watch is watching.

[01:22:45:32]
LMP: Okay. Stay alert.

[01:22:45:34]
CC: Roger. The Black Watch is watching.

[01:22:45:35]
LMP: Roger. I'll stay alert.

[01:22:46:35]
_page : 6
CMP: Okay, Houston. Here comes the status report.

[01:22:46:42]
CC: Roger. We're ready to copy.

[01:22:46:46]
CMP: Roger. For sleep, each of us has had two sleep
     periods; Frank's in his third one right now.
     Bill had 6 hours the last time; I had 4 hours
     the last time. Good to fair, both of us. Frank
     had 5 hours the last time, of fair. And Frank,
     of course, is sleeping now.

[01:22:47:18]
CC: Roger, Jim. How are the three of you feeling?

[01:22:47:24]
CMP: We're all feeling pretty good now; no problems.
     We've all had about between 40 and 60 ounces
     of - or clicks of water so far today.

[01:22:47:38]
CC: Okay.

[01:22:47:43]
CMP: The food: we're up to - we've eaten day 2,
     meal 2 so far. And both of us have eaten the
     rehydratables and the juices and about half of
     the solids.

[01:22:48:07]
CC: Roger. Copy.

[01:22:48:15]
CMP: The cabin's running slightly cold. We do have
     one cabin fan ON, and we're in full heat, and
     it's running just slightly under 70. Might be
     a design note for future spacecraft.

[01:22:48:31]
CC: Roger, Jim. That fan pretty noisy?

[01:22:48:37]
CMP: It's not as noisy as both fans when they're running;
     we cut it down to one fan.

[01:22:48:43]
CC: Roger. We keep thinking we hear it when you're
     talking to us.

[01:22:48:50]
_page : 7
CMP: I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

[01:22:48:56]
LMP: Houston, we're showing a glycol EVAP OUT TEMP
     around 44, and a RAD OUT TEMP of about 28. I
     wonder if we might try some manual mixing here
     to raise the glycol EVAP TEMP OUT a little bit?

[01:22:49:26]
CC: Roger, Bill. Stand by.

[01:22:54:15]
LMP: Okay. Houston, second loop is coming up.

[01:22:54:19]
CC: Roger, Bill.

[01:22:55:16]
LMP: Okay. We're boiling the secondary EVAP, and the
     temperature's stabilized, and so we're gonna close
     up the EVAP pressure valve.

[01:22:55:25]
CC: Roger. Copy.

[01:22:56:33]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[01:22:56:37]
LMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[01:22:56:39]
CC: Roger, Bill. Before you try the manual mixing,
     we'd like you to give it a whirl at the manual
     and increase on the cabin TEMP. Over.

[01:22:56:52]
LMP: We've done that. We're in full HOT, and what
     is your - what's the lowest RAD OUT - individual
     RAD OUT TEMP you seen here during our PTC?

[01:22:57:10]
CC: Roger. Stand by.

[01:22:57:36]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. We saw 26 one time.

[01:22:57:45]
LMP: Roger. Understand; plus 26.

[01:22:57:50]
CC: Affirmative.

[01:22:58:22]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead with your manual
     mixing. Suggest you set your EVAP OUT at about
     55. Over.

[01:22:58:33]
_page : 8
LMP: Okay. We'll give that a try, and let us know
     if the RAD OUT TEMPs get too low.

[01:22:58:38]
CC: Roger. We're monitoring.

[01:23:10:18]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[01:23:10:21]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go.

[01:23:10:26]
LMP: Roger. We have it stabilized about 53 degrees,
     and we will leave it there, but we will go back
     AUTO if you start having any concern about the
     radiators.

[01:23:10:39]
CC: Roger, Bill. We are showing 51.4 here.

[01:23:10:46]
LMP: Okay.

[01:23:23:00]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. We are going to have
     a command changeover to Honeysuckle in about
     2 minutes. Over.

[01:23:23:08]
CMP: Roger, Houston. Standing by.

[01:23:23:13]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. That was Honeysuckle to Madrid.

[01:23:23:21]
CMP: Si, senor.

[01:23:23:27]
LMP: Goodby, you chaps.

[01:23:24:34]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[01:23:24:36]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go.

[01:23:24:40]
CMP: Roger. Did you delete the cislunar NAV exercise
     at 47:15?

[01:23:24:46]
CC: That's affirmative, and we added the extra star
     sightings to the one at 45.

[01:23:27:43]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?

[01:23:27:48]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. Buenas dias, muchachos.

[01:23:27:53]
_page : 9
LMP: Buenas dias. We're going to be answering your
     calls pretty quietly for a little while here to
     let the CDR get to sleep. If you can't hear us,
     why, just tell us so.

[01:23:28:09]

[01:23:33:24]
LMP: Roger. My two cohorts are going to try and get
     some sleep here, so y'all might keep a good eye

     other side.

[01:23:33:35]
CC: Roger.

[01:23:34:24]

     as we're switching antennas, or play some music
     or something.

[01:23:41:10]
CC: Say again, Bill. You're kind of garbled.

[01:23:41:15]
LMP: I say you might just give me a call every now and
     then as we switch antennas, just to let me
     know you're still there, or play some music
     or something, just to make sure we haven't
     lost COMM.

CC: Okay, Bill. Your antennas are looking good now.

[01:23:42:03]
CC: Hey, Bill. If you want music, I'll have Mike sing.

[01:23:42:11]
_page : 2
LMP: Ask him to sing "Anchors Aweigh", will you?

[02:00:07:45]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[02:00:07:51]
LMP: Roger.

[02:00:07:53]
CC: On your secondary coolant loop, looks like
     your back-pressure valve might be slightly
     open. I suggest you go to secondary coolant
     loop EVAP switch to the RESET position for
     58 seconds. Over.

[02:00:08:12]
LMP: Roger. I did that again; I'll try it a third
     time.

[02:00:08:14]
CC: Okay.

[02:00:10:04]
LMP: That didn't do it any good, Houston.

[02:00:10:07]
CC: Roger, Bill.

[02:00:10:18]
LMP: Keep an eye on it, in case it starts dropping.
     It stabilized there right after I shut the evaporator
     off.

[02:00:10:24]
CC: Roger. We will watch it.

[02:00:11:06]
LMP: What might have happened, Jim might have gotten
     the water control valve off before we completely
     had the back-pressure valve closed.

[02:00:11:20]
CC: Roger. Understand Jim turned the water control
     valve off.

[02:00:11:28]
LMP: Roger. We have the secondary water EVAP control
     valve off, but he might have gotten it off on
     that return pump chart check prior to the time
     the evaporator back-pressure valve had completely
     closed, which might explain its lower-than-nominal
     state pressure.

[02:00:11:46]
_page : 3
CC: Roger. Understand.

[02:00:30:17]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[02:00:30:23]
LMP: Go ahead.

[02:00:30:24]
CC: Roger, Bill. We see your secondary steam pressure
     coming back up slowly, and we would like to just
     sit and watch it for a while before doing anything
     else.

[02:00:30:36]
LMP: Okay.

CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[02:01:17:07]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.

[02:01:17:13]
LMP: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[02:01:17:15]
CC: Roger. I just wanted to let you know we still
     have voice contact, and we have the morning news
     for you. We can give it to you now or some time
     later, your choice.

[02:01:17:27]
LMP: How about right now?

[02:01:17:29]
CC: Very good. This is the 23rd of December edition of
     the Interstellar Times a la Paul Haney. We would
     like to let you know that there are only 2 more
     shopping days until Christmas. He says your TV
     transmission was a real big hit yesterday. Mickey
     Herskowitz is doing double duty for the Post. He's
     written a couple of columns on your launch in addition
     to his other sports columns, and, Jim, your
     mom certainly appreciated that birthday greeting.
     Twenty-one convicts broke out of a prison in New
     Orleans yesterday, and President Johnson went home
     last night from Bethesda Naval Hospital after his
     bout with the flu. He sends you guys a special
     message - not what to do for the flu - but congratulations
     on the flight. Are you reading me so far
     okay?

[02:01:18:25]
LMP: You're very clear, Mike.

[02:01:18:27]
CC: Good. Well, we had a big blizzard down here in
     the midwest; I don't know if you can see that from
     up there or not. And in Houston, as a matter
     of fact, it's getting pretty chilly, about
     35 degrees. And we would like to know who you
     like next Sunday, Baltimore or Cleveland? Baltimore
     defense looked pretty tremendous yesterday.
     They put on great pass rush, and it sounds to
     CAP COM like Haney is trying to con you guys
     into a bet. Over.

[02:01:18:57]
_page : 2
LMP: I like Baltimore.

[02:01:19:01]
CC: Are you giving points?

[02:01:19:05]
LMP: Negative. I don't bet.

[02:01:19:09]
CC: I guess you don't if you don't give points.

[02:01:19:14]
LMP: Not with you anyway.

[02:01:19:19]
CC: Okay. That's about the size of the news. Houston,
     standing by.

[02:01:19:24]
CDR: How are the families doing, Mike?

[02:01:19:29]
CC: They are doing just great, Bill; just talking to
     Valerie a few minutes ago.

[02:01:19:37]
CDR: That was Frank.

[02:01:19:40]
CC: Oh, well, likewise with Susan. I have not talked
     to her since last night.

[02:01:19:48]
CDR: Roger.

[02:01:21:16]
CDR: Mike, this is Frank again. Would you tell the
     doctors I got about 5 hours of good sleep yesterday?

[02:01:21:21]
CC: Roger. Thank you, Frank; we were wondering about
     that, about 5 hours of good sleep.

[02:01:21:29]
_page : 3
CDR: Right.

[02:01:21:37]
CC: How is everything going up there, Frank; all
     three of you guys feeling okay this morning?

[02:01:21:43]
CDR: Feel fine. Jim went back to sleep. Bill and I
     are having breakfast and everything seems fine.

[02:01:21:48]
CC: Good; glad to hear it.

[02:02:07:18]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[02:02:07:23]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[02:02:07:24]
CC: Just checking in with you after about a 45 minute
     quiet break. Say, we notice on your high-gain
     antenna, if you like, you can get a little bit
     more use out of it by switching to it from OMNI
     when you have a yaw angle of 90 degrees and a
     pitch angle of minus 45 degrees. We are noticing
     that you are staying an extra 10 minutes on the
     OMNI, which is fine; but you could get more use
     out of the high gain if you use that procedure.
     Over.

[02:02:08:00]
CDR: Okay, thank you. It's a lot simpler for us, as
     long as the OMNI isn't working. We've got it all
     wrapped up here on the eight ball with the roll ...
     pointing to an OMNI number. We just switch it;
     it makes it a lot easier, if it is not bothering
     you.

[02:02:08:13]
CC: Okay. That is fine. We are presently happy with
     the COMM, Frank. We are just trying to be helpful.

[02:02:08:25]
_page : 4
CDR: Thank you very much. It's unusual that Mike
     Collins tries to be helpful, but nevertheless,
     thank you very much.

[02:02:08:30]
CC: Good; aerospace first, Frank.

[02:02:08:35]
CDR: Say hello to Howard Tindall for us, will you?
     His procedure seemed to be working.

[02:02:08:39]
CC: Sure will.

[02:02:08:59]
CDR: I hope that you have got everybody looking this
     thing over very carefully. One thing we want is
     a perfect spacecraft before we consider the LOI
     burn.

[02:02:09:07]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We concur, and we are doing
     that.

[02:02:09:13]
CDR: Okay.

[02:02:09:55]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8. The water is in the process
     of being chlorinated at this time.

[02:02:09:59]
CC: Roger. Understand you're chlorinating the water
     at this time.

[02:02:10:06]
CDR: Roger.

[02:02:10:48]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[02:02:10:53]
CDR: Go ahead.

[02:02:10:54]
CC: At your convenience, we would like the readout
     of your service module RCS propellant quantities.
     We haven't gotten one of those so far this flight.

[02:02:11:04]
CDR: Alright. Stand by. We are just about to - need
     to change the antenna. I'll give them to you.

[02:02:12:14]
_page : 5
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?

[02:02:12:18]
CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8.

[02:02:12:25]
CDR: Okay. A, service module A, you ready?

[02:02:12:30]
CC: Ready to copy.

[02:02:12:34]
CDR: The temperature is about 111, the helium pressure
     - Do you just want the quantity, or do you
     want the whole works?

[02:02:12:41]
CC: Well, if you are reading, give us the whole works.

[02:02:12:46]
CDR: Okay. The helium pressure is about 37, the manifold
     is 182, and the quantity is reading 80. B
     has got the temperature about 112, the helium
     pressure about 36.5, the fuel pressure 180, and
     the quantity about 77. C has got the temperature
     of 140 - incidentally, those other temperatures
     should have been 120 instead of 110; I was looking
     at the wrong calibration here. The pressure is
     37, the manifold pressure is about 182, and the
     quantity is 80. Temperature on D is 115, pressure
     is 37, the manifold pressure is 181, and
     the quantity is about 83.

[02:02:14:02]
CC: Roger, Frank. I read you loud and clear. On the
     temperatures, quad A and B should both be 120.
     Roger.

[02:02:14:11]
CDR: Roger.

[02:02:14:12]
CC: Thank you.

[02:02:14:36]
_page : 6
CDR: I will trade all of that good information for
     a readout of the actual quantities. If you will
     give us a minute, we will go ahead and plot them
     up, Mike.

[02:02:14:45]
CC: Roger. We will stand by until we get them for you.

[02:02:16:34]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. I have your service module
     RCS quantities available. Over.

[02:02:16:43]
CDR: Roger. We are ready to copy at 50 hours 16 minutes.

[02:02:16:47]
CC: Okay. I have them both in percent and pounds;
     I'll give you both numbers. The pounds are
     slightly more accurate for plotting on your chart.
     Quad A 72 percent, 219 pounds; quad B 76 percent,
     233 pounds; quad C 70 --

[02:02:17:10]
CDR: Take it a little slower, Mike; whoa, whoa, whoa
     whoa.

[02:02:17:13]
CC: Okay.

[02:02:17:15]
CDR: Slow up. We just got quad A plotted. They are
     on separate charts.

[02:02:17:20]
CC: Okay.

[02:02:17:22]
CDR: Okay for quad B.

[02:02:17:24]
CC: Quad B 76 percent, 233 pounds.

[02:02:17:34]
CDR: Okay. Quad C.

[02:02:17:36]
CC: Seventy-six percent, 231 pounds.

[02:02:17:49]
CDR: Quad D.

[02:02:17:50]
CC: Seventy-six percent, 229 pounds.

[02:02:17:59]
_page : 7
CDR: Okay.

[02:02:18:15]
CDR: Would you give us the O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> as long as we
     are plotting?

[02:02:18:18]
CC: Roger. Stand by for O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>.

[02:02:19:58]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We have got those numbers in
     a percent. We are going to switch them over to
     pounds, and in the meantime, we are going to be
     changing our ground antenna in about another
     2-1/2 minutes. You can expect a COMM glitch.
     Over.

[02:02:20:14]
CDR: Thank you.

[02:02:23:44]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[02:02:23:52]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[02:02:23:55]
CC: Roger. I have your oxygen and hydrogen quantities
     when you are ready to copy.

[02:02:24:02]
CDR: Ready.

[02:02:24:06]
CC: Oxygen tank number 1 270 pounds, 270; oxygen
     tank 2 267, 267 pounds. Over.

[02:02:24:24]
CDR: Roger. Thank you.

[02:02:24:26]
CC: Roger. On the hydrogen, hydrogen tank 1 19.7;
     hydrogen tank 2 20.1. Over.

[02:02:24:41]
CDR: Understand; 19.7 and 20.1.

[02:02:24:44]
CC: Roger. You are a little bit low on the line on
     your graph due to the fact that they started out
     low.

[02:02:56:15]
CC: Roger, Frank. Your 51-hour update of block
     data will be omitted. The block data you have
     on board is satisfactory. Over.

[02:02:56:28]
CDR: Understand. The block data we have aboard is
     satisfactory.

[02:02:56:30]
CC: Right. That's for the flyby and pericynthian
     plus 2 hour block update. We would like also
     to get a current up-to-date report on all your
     windows. We are trying to make some alternate
     plans for using the center hatch window when
     you are in lunar orbit, and we would like to
     make sure we understand exactly what the condition
     of all five windows is. Over.

[02:02:56:54]
CDR: Okay. Number - window number 1 and number 5 are
     clouded, but they may be partially useful. The
     hatch window is very badly clouded. Windows
     number 2 and 4 are good.

[02:02:57:06]
CC: Okay. Understand the hatch window is unusable, 1
     and 5 are partially usable, and the rendezvous
     windows are both good.

[02:02:57:17]
_page : 2
CDR: Right.

[02:02:57:18]
CC: Okay.

CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[02:03:13:18]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[02:03:13:20]
CC: Roger, Frank. We would like to ask you about
     the next few hours in the flight plan. We are
     inclined to let Jim go ahead and sleep and to
     slip the P23 that occurs at 52:15. On the other
     hand, we would think it would probably be a
     good idea if he returned more to the normal sleep
     rest cycle; and if you got him up nominally to
     do the 52:15 work, then perhaps he would be ready
     to go back to sleep at about 61 hours, when he
     nominally is expected to do so.

[02:03:13:55]
CDR: Okay. He's up now, eating. We are planning to
     go to normal procedures on the flight plan.

[02:03:14:02]
CC: Okay. That - that's fine then. If - you know,
     there is no - it's not time critical that P23
     be done at 52:15, but if you get up to do it then,
     that's just fine.

[02:03:14:16]
CDR: Well, we thought we might give it a try.

[02:03:14:18]
CC: Roger.

[02:03:14:23]
CDR: This sleep cycle here is - we're just going to
     have to real time it, I guess. I'm supposed to
     be asleep right now but, obviously - or I'm supposed
     to go to sleep here shortly, but I just got up.
     We are going to have to play this by ear.

[02:03:14:39]
_page : 3
CC: Roger. Understand.

[02:03:17:39]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[02:03:17:41]
CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8.

[02:03:17:46]
CDR: Are the stars in the flight plan proper for this
     next exercise of P23?

[02:03:17:52]
CC: We would like to talk to Jim about it when he is
     ready to copy.

[02:03:17:59]
CDR: He's ready.

[02:03:18:01]
CC: Okay.

[02:03:18:03]
CMP: Good morning, Mike. How are you doing?

[02:03:18:05]
CC: Fine, fine, Jim. You are sounding good this
     morning. We would like to give you a little
     rundown on these stars. As you can see in the
     flight plan, we've got you scheduled for a number
     33, Antares, number 34, Atria, and number 40,
     old Altair. Now, the first of those, Antares,
     is in plane; the second two are out of plane. As
     you know, we would like to get a mixture of the in
     and the out of plane. Antares, number 33, is
     close to the sun, and we expect that you are going
     to have difficulty getting these measurements on
     number 33. We would like very much for you to
     try, but if you are unable to do number 33, then
     we propose that you use number 42, which is Peacock,
     to the lunar far horizon. We realize Peacock isn't
     the greatest one available - greatest star in the
     sky - but it's about the only one available. Over.

[02:03:19:06]
_page : 4
CMP: Roger. Understand. I'll - we will go to
     Antares first and try it. You know, we tried
     it last time, but I got one set before I lost
     the moon completely in the white haze. I'll
     give it another try, and if it doesn't work
     out, we will go to Peacock and give it -

[02:03:19:26]
CC: That - that is affirmative, Jim, and if neither
     Antares nor Peacock work, well then, we just will
     be happy to go with Atria and with Altair. We
     would like them to increase the number of sets
     and do three on Atria, that is, number 34, and two
     on Altair, number 40; but that is only in the event
     that you can get neither Antares nor Peacock.

[02:03:20:07]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Did you copy?

[02:03:20:12]
CMP: Roger. This is 8. Copied. We'll increase the
     number 34 to three and the number set of 40 to
     two if we cannot get 33 or 42.

[02:03:20:25]
CC: Yes, that's exactly right.

[02:03:47:55]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.

[02:03:47:59]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[02:03:48:02]
CC: Roger. We're getting low bit rate from you,
     rather than high, and on this P23 work, for us
     to get our data, you're going to have to delay
     the DSKY display about 10 seconds when it comes
     up with NOUN - NOUN 87. Over.

[02:03:48:18]
CDR: Roger.

[02:03:48:44]
_page : 5
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We are past that 87 display
     now. Did you write down what your trunnion bias
     was?

[02:03:48:57]
CDR: Negative.

[02:03:49:00]
CMP: Houston, we haven't started 23 yet. Our CAL is
     zero.

[02:03:49:12]
CC: Roger. Understand. Thank you.

[02:03:49:17]
CMP: We are in the process now to - to go to P23
     attitude.

[02:03:53:49]
CC: Roger. Downlink data shows that on star 33,
     Jim is using the lunar far horizon when he should
     be using the lunar near horizon. Over.

[02:03:54:02]
CDR: Okay. Thank you. 220?

[02:03:54:07]
CC: Roger. 220.

[02:03:54:14]
CDR: Let us check it.

[02:03:54:16]
CC: Roger.

[02:03:54:58]
CDR: You want the far horizon now, Houston?

[02:03:55:01]
CC: Roger. Far horizon.

[02:03:55:06]
CDR: We have far horizon in now, Mike, on 220. I
     will check again, though.

[02:03:55:12]
CC: Yes. That is right. We are requesting the
     lunar near horizon as per the flight plan, the
     lunar near horizon. We show that you are using
     the lunar far horizon.

[02:03:55:27]
_page : 6
CMP: Okay. Roger. I thought that you had copied
     up 220 to me. I will put it in the near horizon.

[02:03:55:34]
CC: Roger.

[02:03:58:50]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. Over.

[02:03:58:52]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.

[02:03:59:03]
LMP: Mike, it's getting kind of damp - we're getting
     a playback, Mike. It is getting kind of damp in
     here. It might be a good idea to go back into
     AUTO on the temp in - the glycol temp in for
     awhile to try and get some of this moisture out
     of the cabin.

[02:03:59:21]
CC: Roger. Stand by, Bill.

[02:03:59:28]
LMP: Roger.

[02:04:00:08]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[02:04:00:13]
LMP: Go ahead.

[02:04:00:14]
CC: We concur. We would like you to go back to
     AUTO on the glycol temp inlet valve. Over.

[02:04:00:22]
LMP: Okay. When was our lowest radiator OUT TEMP
     during the last couple of hours while we have
     been in MANUAL?

[02:04:00:28]
CC: I will get it for you.

[02:04:00:33]
LMP: And we are back in AUTO.

[02:04:00:35]
CC: Roger. Back in AUTO, and 29 degrees is as low
     as we've seen.

[02:04:00:43]
LMP: Okay. We are showing a CABIN TEMP of about 76.
     It is very comfortable, but we are getting a lot
     of condensation on the walls now.

[02:04:00:54]
_page : 7
CC: Roger. Understand.

CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[02:04:05:04]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston.

[02:04:05:08]
CDR: Roger, Mike. While we are waiting for the
     spacecraft to maneuver to the moon, I might
     note that as we get closer to the moon, the
     light from the sun comes right into the scanning
     telescope, and it is impossible to use. You have
     to rely on the sextant alone.

[02:04:05:35]
CC: Roger, Jim. Understand that light from the sun
     is coming into the scanning telescope making it
     impossible to see, and you have to rely on the
     sextant alone. Can you attach any angle to that?

[02:04:05:55]
CDR: Well, Mike, I am right now at the substellar point
     of 33. I don't know where the sun is exactly
     from there, but that is about the angle. We're -
     the optics are pointed right at the moon now.

[02:04:06:10]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[02:04:08:47]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We are going to be changing
     our antenna in a couple of minutes. You can
     expect a COMM switch-over.

[02:04:08:57]
CDR: Thank you.

LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. Over.

[02:04:19:26]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go.

[02:04:19:30]
LMP: Roger. The LMP is going to take a little snooze
     here for a while. I am wondering, can you give me
     a quick - your view of the system status here before
     I depart, and, also, give me an idea of when
     the next cryo stir is due?

[02:04:19:48]
CC: Roger, Bill. Will do; stand by.

[02:04:20:23]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[02:04:20:27]
LMP: Go ahead.

[02:04:20:29]
CC: Roger. Your systems remain unchanged. They are
     all looking good. You can go ahead and stir up
     the cryo starting right now.

[02:04:20:38]
LMP: Okay. Will do.

[02:04:25:19]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[02:04:25:23]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[02:04:25:25]
CC: Roger. Before Jim makes his next mark, could he
     call up VERB 1 NOUN 91? We missed the last
     trunnion. Over.

[02:04:25:36]
CDR: Roger. The last trunnion was 10660.

[02:04:25:41]
CC: 10660. Thank you.

[02:04:26:53]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[02:04:26:59]
CDR: Go ahead.

[02:04:27:00]
CC: Roger. Before Bill gets his snooze, we would like
     him to give us a PRD readout on all three crewmembers. Over.

[02:04:27:12]
_page : 2
LMP: Roger. CDR is 0.06, CMP is 0.64, and LMP is 0.64.

[02:04:27:51]
CC: Roger. Thank you, Bill.

[02:04:28:00]
CDR: Looks like I'm the only one that is radioactive.

[02:04:28:02]
CC: Understand.

[02:04:28:18]
CMP: Okay. Houston, we got three sets on 33; we are
     going now to 34 lunar far horizon for one set.
     Don't you agree?

[02:04:28:26]
CC: We agree. Star 34 lunar far horizon for one set.

[02:04:29:48]
LMP: Houston, the cryos have been stirred, and could
     you also give me a quick rundown on how the SPS
     line temps are doing?

[02:04:29:58]
CC: Roger, Bill. Understand you stirred the cryos.
     Last time we checked, the SPS line temps were
     excellent; they were nice and warm. We will give
     you another number right now.

[02:04:30:10]
LMP: And a PU valve.

[02:04:31:05]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[02:04:31:10]
LMP: Go ahead.

[02:04:31:12]
CC: Roger. On your SPS system, your oxidizer is running
     75 degrees, fuel 74 degrees, and PU valve between
     78 and 82 depending on where we measured it. Over.

[02:04:31:27]
LMP: Real good. Everything really is working fine, isn't
     it?

[02:04:31:30]
CC: Yes, it's really humming along, Bill.

[02:04:31:37]
LMP: Okay. See you later.

[02:04:31:39]
CC: Adios.

[02:04:37:57]
_page : 3
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[02:04:38:01]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston.

[02:04:38:05]
CDR: I understand you want two sets on number 40,
     lunar near horizon. Is that right?

[02:04:38:08]
CC: That's affirmative. Two sets on number 40,
     lunar near horizon.

[02:04:42:25]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[02:04:42:30]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[02:04:42:32]
CC: Roger. We missed your last trunnion angle, Frank.

[02:04:42:37]
CDR: 21450.

[02:04:42:41]
CC: Roger. 21450, and Paul tells me Valerie is over
     here and wishes Bill a happy nap.

[02:04:42:52]
CDR: Okay. Thank you. Tell her that he makes us
     tired sometimes too, will you?

[02:04:43:13]
CC: Roger. I will deliver a modified version of the
     message.

[02:04:43:20]
CDR: Thank you.

[02:04:43:58]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[02:04:44:04]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[02:04:44:07]
CC: Roger. On star number 40 that you are doing now,
     the flight plan only calls for one set of marks.
     You called down two sets, and it's really your
     choice. Only one is required. We are glad to
     have the data if you do a second set. Over.

[02:04:44:24]
CDR: We will only do one then, if you want to. Our
     flight plan has been updated to include two sets.
     That is why I called it down.

[02:04:44:32]
CC: Roger. One set is - will suffice.

[02:04:47:28]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We missed the last trunnion.

[02:04:47:34]
CDR: Very well, I will read it to you; 21455.

[02:04:47:39]
CC: 21455. Thank you. Just a matter of interest:
     it is taking your voice about 1.6 seconds to
     get down to us.

[02:04:47:51]
CDR: I'm a little hoarse, that's why.

[02:04:48:19]
CDR: Okay. Houston, do you want us to go back to the
     PTC attitude now and start the rotisserie again?

[02:04:48:25]
CC: That is affirmative, Frank. We will have the PTC
     attitude for you in just a second here.

[02:04:48:48]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[02:04:48:53]
CDR: Go ahead.

[02:04:48:55]
CC: Roger. Those PTC attitudes remain pitch 224 degrees,
     yaw 020 degrees. On the next page, page 239 of
     your flight plan, those PTC numbers should be changed
     to reflect that.

[02:04:49:12]
CDR: Pitch 224 and yaw 20.

[02:04:49:15]
CC: That's affirmative.

[02:04:52:23]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[02:04:52:25]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[02:04:52:31]
CC: When you have a few minutes, we would like to
     hear the detailed crew status report from you.

[02:04:52:40]
CDR: Like what?

[02:04:52:42]
CC: Well, like we would like to know, in the last
     24 hours, has anybody had any symptoms similar
     to Frank's. We would also like to know - You know,
     we told you the other day to take Marezine as you
     like - we would like to know if anybody had taken
     any drugs, and then we would like to talk over there
     about sweet breads and water and such.

[02:04:53:01]
_page : 5
CDR: Okay. Nobody has taken any other drugs; nobody
     took any Marezine; nobody is sick. Bill took one
     of those pills, a sleep Seconal pill, last night.
     Everybody had breakfast this morning and ate most
     of a meal - 1 day 3 - meal A day 3. What else
     do you want?

[02:04:53:31]
CC: We would like to tell you to drink plenty of water.
     We think that your water intake may be down. We
     copied your dosimeter readings. The only other
     thing is we just were wondering how in general you
     feel. We show you to have about 15 hours sleep
     total - Frank or Bill about 10, and Jim about
     the same, and we were wondering just how you
     are feeling in general.

[02:04:53:58]
CDR: We all feel fine; we are going to fix it now so
     that we all have one more rest period before the
     LOI.

[02:04:54:04]
CC: Roger. Thank you.

[02:04:54:11]
CMP: Happiness is bacon squares for breakfast.

[02:04:54:18]
CC: If you don't eat them all, bring them back,
     and we'll polish them off here.

[02:04:54:34]
_page : 6
CDR: Okay, Houston. Apollo 8 here. I stand corrected,
     William had one Marezine. He didn't tell me
     about it; he snuck it.

[02:04:54:40]
CC: Roger. Understand Lovell took the Marezine.
     Understand.

[02:04:54:43]
CDR: That's Bill Anders, and he took one when he took
     the - with the Lomotil, when the doctors told him
     to.

[02:04:54:54]
CC: Roger. We copy that. Thank you.

[02:04:56:06]
CDR: Okay. We are back on the bar-b-que attitude,
     starting PTC.

[02:04:56:10]
CC: Roger, Apollo 8. Thank you.

[02:04:56:21]
CDR: Mike, we ran the latest state vector we have through
     the P21, and it showed the pericynthian at 69.7 miles.

[02:04:56:30]
CC: Yes, we were all having big talks about that down
     here. It looks like you are giving us a real good
     comparison on our system. Looking - looking extremely good.

[02:04:56:45]
CDR: We've got the navigator par excellence.

[02:04:56:50]
CC: I believe.

[02:04:57:28]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[02:04:57:33]
CDR: Go ahead.

[02:04:57:36]
CC: Roger. What was the time you used on that P21?

[02:04:57:42]
CDR: 6910 there, Mr. Slide Rule.

[02:04:57:46]
CC: Thank you.

[02:04:58:01]
CC: Mike, I wonder if Buzz wants us to change the time?

[02:04:58:04]
_page : 7
CC: No, that is fine.

[02:04:58:07]
CDR: Oh, okay. Thank you.

[02:05:03:07]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[02:05:03:11]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[02:05:03:15]
CDR: Roger. Are you going to give us an update for
     a maneuver PC plus 2 that does not assume a flyby
     maneuver?

[02:05:03:26]
CC: Roger. Stand by.

[02:05:08:03]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[02:05:08:12]
CMP: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8 here.

[02:05:08:14]
CC: Roger. Here is a rather brief summary of the
     updates that you will be getting. The one that you
     have now for PC plus 2 following an LOI minus 8
     flyby maneuver is still good. That will not be
     updated. The next update you will get will be
     MCC 4. After that, you will get two PC plus 2
     maneuvers, that assume MCC 4 completed. One will
     be a minimum DELTA-V, and the other will be a
     fast return. Do you copy?

[02:05:08:50]
CMP: Roger. Understand, and also I take it for MCC 4
     you are going to give us a new alignment. Is
     that correct?

[02:05:08:57]
CC: That is affirmative.

[02:05:26:31]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[02:05:26:36]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[02:05:26:38]
_page : 8
CC: Roger, Frank. I've got a lot of talking to do
     regarding TV cameras and brackets and whatnot. I
     would like to start in on it whenever you are
     ready to talk about it.

[02:05:26:52]
CDR: Let me get a piece of paper out.

[02:05:26:54]
CC: Okay.

[02:05:27:06]
CDR: Go ahead.

[02:05:27:08]
CC: Okay. First a question. Are you planning to
     show us TV pictures of the earth today?

[02:05:27:18]
CDR: Well, that is what we wanted to do. It seems
     that would be the most interesting thing we can
     show you, but we - you know, we had trouble with
     the lens.

[02:05:27:25]
CC: Well, okay, that's good. All this procedure
     that I am going to give to you here is relative
     to what we hope are fixes to the lens and for
     looking out your rendezvous window at the earth,
     and all the gimbal angles and all that good
     stuff is based toward looking out the window at
     the earth rather than at the moon. Over.

[02:05:27:49]
CDR: Roger.

[02:05:27:50]
CC: Okay. First, unstow the red filter, the polarizing
     filter, the red and blue filter holder, and some
     tape. Over.

[02:05:28:07]
CDR: Okay. Let me write this down.

[02:05:28:09]
CC: Roger. I'd suggest that. I've got a whole page
     full.

[02:05:28:33]
_page : 9
CDR: Okay.

[02:05:28:35]
CC: Alright. Tape the red filter to the telephoto
     lens. That red filter is the 25A red filter,
     not the one that is in the red and blue filter
     holder.

[02:05:28:48]
CDR: Roger.

[02:05:28:49]
CC: Attach telephoto lens to the camera.

[02:05:28:56]
CDR: Okay. We can figure out how to do that. Roger.

[02:05:29:00]
CC: Insure that the automatic light control, the ALC
     switch on the camera, is in the IN position.
     Over.

[02:05:29:11]
CDR: ALC IN. Roger.

[02:05:29:14]
CC: Roger. Attach camera to the adjustable TV bracket
     and attach the bracket to the TV mounting point
     on the commander's side of the hatch to point out
     rendezvous window number 2.

[02:05:29:41]
CDR: Roger.

[02:05:29:43]
CC: Okay. There is a note here that says use dovetail
     on top of camera, rather than the side dovetail.
     Use the dovetail on the top of the camera for mounting
     to bracket and place the rocking nut on the
     bracket down, and down means toward your minus X
     direction.

[02:05:30:16]
CDR: Roger.

[02:05:30:18]
CC: Okay. They say this step I just got through giving
     you is somewhat complicated. You might want to get
     the cameras set up early using the instructions I
     just gave you. When it's properly - -

[02:05:30:31]
_page : 10
CDR: We are not reading you.

[02:05:30:34]
CC: Roger. I say again, the instructions that I
     just gave you should end up having the camera
     looking out the window and about 30 degrees
     yawed left from your plus X-axis, so I suggest you
     get the camera set up that way early; and if
     there are any problems, come back to us; we will
     talk them over. These mounting instructions are
     sort of complicated.

[02:05:31:00]
CDR: Roger.

[02:05:31:03]
CC: Okay. The next step: dim the interior lights.
     Over.

[02:05:31:12]
CDR: Dim interior lights.

[02:05:31:14]
CC: Roger. Next, stop passive thermal control at
     gimbal angles pitch 224, yaw 020, roll 270. Over.

[02:05:31:36]
CDR: Pitch 224, yaw 020, roll 270.

[02:05:31:41]
CC: Roger. Next, acquire on high-gain antenna, switch
     to AUTO tracks, narrow beam upon acquisition. Over.

[02:05:32:02]
CDR: Got it.

[02:05:32:04]
CC: Okay. Yaw spacecraft left to get good view of
     earth and your rendezvous window number 2. You
     may have to pitch slightly as well, but primarily
     a left yawing maneuver to get a good view of the
     earth.

[02:05:32:20]
_page : 11
CDR: Got it.

[02:05:32:22]
CC: Okay. This maneuver is going to put you very
     close to your scan limits for the high-gain
     antenna, so while you are making the maneuver,
     check your lights. If your scan limit light comes
     on, you still have got 15 degrees to play with.
     But the only message is, should you break lock,
     then you are going to have to go back and reacquire
     and do that maneuver over again, because you are
     going to be very close to the edge of your high-gain
     antenna capability.

[02:05:32:52]
CDR: Thank you.

[02:05:32:54]
CC: Okay. And then finally, now that you have got the
     spacecraft over there, aim the camera as required
     to include the earth in the field of view, and
     do not touch the body of the lens while televising.
     Apparently, if you put your hands on the lens
     itself, it causes electrical interference. Over.

[02:05:33:26]
CDR: Okay. Aim camera and do not touch lens while
     televising.

[02:05:33:30]
CC: Right. And in all this stuff in all these pictures
     using the ALC, it is important that you let
     the camera stabilize for at least 10 or 20 seconds,
     to let the ALC do its thing.

[02:05:33:58]
CDR: Stabilize for 10 to 20 seconds. Thank you.

[02:05:34:01]
CC: Right. Now we have some additional instructions in
     case this does not work. They say a full 20, Frank,
     on that ALC. It requires a full 20 seconds undisturbed
     for the ALC to properly do its thing. Now
     if these procedures that I've given you do not
     work, then we will be giving you some more, and
     they have to do with other filters and various
     combinations thereof. So I'd have the polarizing
     filter and the red and blue filter holder at hand
     because we will be attempting to use those in
     addition to the red filters if this procedure
     doesn't work.

[02:05:34:43]
_page : 12
CDR: All very well, Mike.

[02:05:34:46]
CC: That's all we have right now. We will have a few
     more remarks on the TV coming up to you later.
     I would suggest that you get set up for this early,
     and if you have any questions on it, shoot them
     down to us. We have a bunch of experts down here
     to help out.

[02:05:35:03]
CDR: Thank you; will do.

[02:06:06:25]
CC: Roger. Just a voice check, Frank.

[02:06:06:30]
CDR: Roger. You're loud and clear.

[02:06:06:32]

[02:06:18:55]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[02:06:18:57]
CC: Roger. We would like some high bit rate data
     when you can get it locked up on the high gain.
     We haven't had any of that for a while.

[02:06:19:06]
CDR: Roger. We will do that.

[02:06:19:09]
CC: Thank you. How is that camera bracket thing
     working out?

[02:06:19:13]
CDR: We are doing it right now.

[02:06:19:53]
CDR: Houston, this is Apollo 8 transmitting to you
     on the high gain. How do you read?

[02:06:19:57]
CC: Read you loud and clear, Frank. Thank you.

[02:06:20:08]
CDR: Apollo 8 transmitting on the high-gain antenna.

[02:06:20:11]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. You are loud and clear. Thank
     you for the high gain.

[02:06:20:18]
CDR: Roger.

[02:06:32:59]
CDR: Houston, this is Apollo 8. Are you getting high
     bit rate all right?

[02:06:33:08]
CC: That is affirmative, Apollo 8. We are getting
     a good high bit rate.

[02:06:33:40]
CDR: Go ahead.

[02:06:33:42]
CC: Roger. I've got some more talking to do about
     the TV any time it's convenient for you.

[02:06:33:48]
CDR: Go ahead.

[02:06:33:50]
CC: Okay. First thing, we've made no provisions
     in these instructions for taking pictures of the
     moon. If you get some moon shots after it's all
     over by looking out a different window or by
     making some small maneuver, of course, we would
     be happy to have them, but the show as scheduled
     is just out the window at the earth only. Over.

[02:06:34:15]
CDR: Roger.

[02:06:34:17]
CC: The second point is, of course, when you stop
     your passive thermal control, you are about 90 degrees
     to the earth line, so when you make that
     yaw left, you are going to have to yaw left until
     your middle gimbal angle is in the vicinity of
     60 degrees. You will get the additional 30 degrees
     by offset between where the camera is pointed and
     your plus X axis. But the two together are going
     to total up around 90. We just wanted to make sure
     that you understood you were going to be working
     with a large middle gimbal angle. Over.

[02:06:34:52]
CDR: Roger. We understand that. We also are looking
     at the earth right now, and there is a spectacular
     long thin band of clouds. Looks like it may be
     a jet stream. It's absolutely spectacular -
     going almost all the way - or half way around the
     earth.

[02:06:35:12]
_page : 3
CC: Roger. Well, you might want to repeat that during
     the TV narrative, and we would like you, if possible,
     to go into as much of a detailed description as you
     poets can on the various colors and sizes of those
     things and how the earth appears to you, in as much
     detail as you can possibly muster. Over.

[02:06:35:36]
CDR: Roger. I figure we will have to do that because
     I bet you - I won't bet - but I bet the TV doesn't
     work.

[02:06:35:44]
CC: Well, we won't take that bet, but anyway, we are
     standing by for a nice lurid description, and
     we would suggest that you talk a little bit slower
     than you did yesterday. Over.

[02:06:35:56]
CDR: Okay.

[02:06:35:58]
CC: And the only other thing on this TV is that the
     experts tell us that - do not point - with the
     wide angle lens on the camera, do not point at
     either the earth or the moon. It comes close to
     damaging interior of the instrument due to the
     fact that it's too bright. Over.

[02:06:36:18]
CDR: Understand.

[02:06:36:20]
CC: Thank you.

CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[02:06:57:44]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[02:06:57:46]
CC: Roger. We'll be switching antennas from Madrid
     to Goldstone in another 3 minutes. You can
     expect a glitch on your COMM.

[02:06:57:56]
CDR: Thank you.

[02:07:02:38]
CDR: Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.

[02:07:02:41]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We're reading you loud
     and clear through Goldstone. Over.

[02:07:02:46]
CDR: Okay. We have the television ON now, and we're
     trying to maneuver to the - to the earth.

[02:07:02:55]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[02:07:04:11]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[02:07:04:15]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[02:07:04:20]
CMP: Roger. We're maneuvering to position now for
     the TV. Bill's got it set up in Frank's left
     rendezvous window, and I'm over in Bill's spot
     looking out the right rendezvous window, and the
     earth is now passing through my window. It's
     about as big as the end of my thumb.

[02:07:04:45]
_page : 5
CC: About as big as the end of your thumb at arm's
     length, huh?

[02:07:04:51]
CMP: That's right. I think what we see now is South
     America down below us.

[02:07:04:55]
CC: Roger. Is the TV camera pointed about 30 degrees
     yaw left from the plus X axis?

[02:07:05:05]
CMP: Stand by a moment. We're checking it. We think
     we've got it in the right position. We're going
     into position now.

[02:07:05:13]
CC: Okay.

[02:07:05:33]
LMP: Houston, are you getting any sort of a picture?

[02:07:05:52]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Negative; not yet.

[02:07:06:32]
LMP: Okay. Houston, Apollo 8. We should have - -

[02:07:07:36]
CDR: Hello, Houston; this is Apollo 8. We have the
     television camera pointed directly at the earth
     now and have followed the instructions you gave
     us.

[02:07:07:45]
CC: Roger, Frank. We're picking something up on our
     TV. It's not very good so far, but let it sit
     for a second, and we'll have more instructions
     for you.

[02:07:08:00]
CC: Okay. It's coming into view now, Frank.

[02:07:08:07]
CDR: It is?

[02:07:08:08]
CC: Yes. We have it in the corner of our screen.
     You're slightly off on your pointing, but we're
     getting a darn good look at the corner of it.

[02:07:08:21]
_page : 6
CC: It's moving off, Frank. It's moving off our -
     3 o'clock on our TV screen. I have no idea
     what to tell you about which way to point.

[02:07:08:32]
CC: It's moving further away. We've lost it now.

[02:07:08:57]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Receiving nothing now. Over.

[02:07:09:03]
CDR: Okay.

[02:07:09:05]
CC: We're receiving the picture; we're just not
     seeing the view of the earth.

[02:07:09:11]
CDR: Roger. I got you.

[02:07:09:16]
CC: Okay. We are just picking it up at 3 o'clock
     on our screen.

[02:07:09:21]
CDR: Okay.

[02:07:09:23]
CC: It is moving up toward 1 o'clock and in toward
     the center; keep it going in that direction.

[02:07:09:29]
CDR: Okay.

[02:07:09:31]
CC: It's looking better. You're holding it about
     1 or 2 o'clock. Looking better. Give us a
     little more in that same direction. You're down
     at 3 o'clock now. We see about half of what you
     see. Too much. It is disappearing at our
     5 o'clock. Now it is coming back. It is half
     off - screen at our 2 o'clock.

[02:07:10:05]
CC: And it's disappeared off at our 3 o'clock. There,
     It is coming back in now. It is headed toward the
     center of our screen.

[02:07:10:14]
CC: MARK.

[02:07:10:15]
_page : 7
CC: It is right in the center of our screen. Just
     hold her - hold her steady. It is really looking
     good. Okay. We have - -

[02:07:10:28]
CMP: What you're seeing, Mike, is a - Houston, what
     you are seeing is the Western Hemisphere.
     Looking - at the top is the North Pole; in the
     center - just lower to the center is South America -
     all the way down to Cape Horn. I can see Baja
     California and the southwestern part of the United
     States. There is a big long cloud bank going
     northeast, covers a lot of the Gulf of Mexico,
     going up to the eastern part of the United States,
     and it appears now that the east coast is cloudy,
     I can see clouds over parts of Mexico; the parts
     of Central America are clear. And we can also see
     the white, bright spots of the subsolar point on
     the light side of the earth.

[02:07:11:28]
CC: Roger. Could you give me some ideas about the
     colors, and also, could you try a slight maneuver?
     It is disappearing. We're seeing about half of it.
     It is going off to our 12 o'clock. Now it is
     going off to our 3 o'clock. That is the wrong
     direction. Yes, that is a good direction.

[02:07:11:50]
CC: We need another small correction to bring it to our
     center screen. If you could maneuver toward the
     terminator, that is the part of it we are missing.
     We are getting the lighted portion. There you
     go; that's fine. Stop it right there.

[02:07:12:17]
_page : 8
CMP: Okay. For colors, waters are all sort of a royal
     blue; clouds, of course, are bright white; the
     reflection off the earth is - appears much
     greater than the moon. The land areas are generally
     a brownish - sort of dark brownish to light brown
     in texture. Many of the vortices of clouds can
     be seen of the various weather cells. A long
     band of - it appears cirrus clouds that extend
     from the entrance to the Gulf of Mexico going
     straight out across the Atlantic. The terminator,
     of course, cuts through the Atlantic Ocean right
     now, going from north to south. Southern Hemisphere
     is almost completely clouded over, and up near
     the North Pole there is quite a few clouds.
     Southwestern Texas and southwestern United States
     is clear. I'd say there are some clouds up in
     the northwest and over in the northeast portion.

[02:07:13:25]
CC: Roger. Could you maneuver toward the terminator
     again, please?

[02:07:13:34]
CC: A little bit more. Stop her right there and hold
     it. It keeps slipping up a little bit; could
     you maneuver slightly more toward the terminator?

[02:07:14:02]
CDR: How is that, Houston?

[02:07:14:05]
_page : 9
CC: We are getting about half of the earth, Frank.
     The top half - our top half which includes the
     dark portion it - is obscured.

[02:07:14:19]
CDR: How is the definition on the picture?

[02:07:14:23]
CC: Looks pretty good.

[02:07:14:28]
CMP: Can you see cloud patterns at all?

[02:07:14:31]
CC: That's affirmative.

[02:07:14:36]
CMP: Good.

[02:07:14:39]
LMP: Are you still seeing it, Houston?

[02:07:14:42]
CC: Yes, we are seeing it. We are missing the
     portion of the earth that is over toward the
     terminator. The dark portion of the earth is
     what we are not picking up. We are getting
     about three-quarters or four-fifths of the
     rest of it.

[02:07:14:56]
LMP: Roger. I will move it, and tell me when I am
     getting better or worse please.

[02:07:15:01]
CC: Good.

[02:07:15:08]
CC: Stop right there. That is worse, Bill. Go
     back where you were. You make it disappear to
     our 3 o'clock. Now it's coming back. Okay.
     Stop right there. Now you are back where you were,
     and we need a motion that is about 90 degrees to
     that last one you gave us.

[02:07:15:38]
CC: That is the wrong 90 degrees. 180 degrees away
     from that one.

[02:07:15:47]
_page : 10
CC: Stop right there. Okay. Now we have lost a
     different half of it. I need a motion 90 degrees
     to that last one.

[02:07:16:24]
CC: That is good right there, Bill. That is good
     right there.

[02:07:16:42]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. If you can stick your polarizing
     filter in front of the camera without
     disturbing anything else, it might improve the
     quality slightly.

[02:07:17:02]
LMP: Standby.

[02:07:17:04]
CC: Roger, Bill.

[02:07:17:12]
LMP: Okay. The polarising filter is in front.

[02:07:17:24]
LMP: How is it now, Mike?

[02:07:17:28]
CC: Still looking good. That didn't make much of
     a change one way or another, but in general, considering
     how far away, it's looking excellent.

[02:07:17:51]
LMP: Well, I hope that everyone enjoys the picture
     that we are taking of themselves. How far away
     from earth now, Jim, about?

[02:07:18:03]
CC: We have you about 180 000.

[02:07:18:11]
LMP: You are looking at yourselves at 180 000 miles
     out in space.

[02:07:18:22]
CMP: Frank, what I keep imagining is if I am some
     lonely traveler from another planet what I
     would think about the earth at this altitude,
     whether I think it would be inhabited or not.

[02:07:18:31]
_page : 11
CC: Don't see anybody waving; is that what you are
     saying?

[02:07:18:36]
CMP: I was just kind of curious if I would land on
     the blue or the brown part of the earth.

[02:07:18:44]
LMP: You better hope that we land on the blue part.

[02:07:18:46]
CC: So do we, babe.

[02:07:18:49]
LMP: Jim is always for land landings.

[02:07:18:55]
CC: Roger. This picture is drifting off center
     again. If you could make another correction
     to bring it back. I couldn't tell you which
     direction, but you're going the right way, you're
     going the right way. A little bit more; a little
     bit more. Whoa, stop right there. That's the
     best centering we have had, Apollo 8. If you
     could just hold that, that's perfect,

[02:07:19:25]
LMP: To give you some idea, Mike, of what we can
     see: I can pick out the southwest coastline of
     the Gulf and where Houston should be, and also
     the mouth of the Mississippi; I can see Baja
     California and that particular area. I am using
     a monocular that we have aboard.

[02:07:19:50]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[02:07:19:55]
CMP: This is an 8-power instrument I have.

[02:07:19:58]
CC: Right. Well, we are seeing the entire earth
     now including the terminator. Course we can't
     see anything past the terminator at all. Are
     you able with your binoculars to see the dark
     horizon? Anything past the terminator?

[02:07:20:13]
_page : 12
CMP: Negative, Mike. We can't see anything past the
     terminator with the binoculars or without them.
     This earth is just too bright, and it cuts down
     the night adaptation to see anything on the
     dark side.

[02:07:20:31]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[02:07:20:33]
LMP: Since this is winter - since this is winter time
     in the northern hemisphere, we can see all of
     the South Pole and the southern ice cap, and
     not too much of the North Pole.

[02:07:20:48]
CDR: Hey, you and Jim better get together. Jim just
     said he saw the North Pole.

[02:07:20:54]
CC: He is looking out a different window.

[02:07:20:57]
LMP: That is what makes it different.

[02:07:20:59]
CC: Do you still have the - -

[02:07:21:01]
LMP: He has the monocular upside down.

[02:07:21:03]
CC: Do you still have the polarizing filter in front
     of the camera?
     END OF TAPE
     ---- LMP Negative?
     ---- CC Okay.
     ---- CC Try putting it back in front of the camera one
     more time.
     ---- LMP ... Okay?
     ---- CC And once again, we need a small attitude correction.
     Our earth is disappearing up and to the right.
     Our earth and your earth. The wrong way, wrong
     way. A little bit more. Okay. That is fine
     if you can hold it right there. Oops! Now it's
     slipping back off again. Okay. Keep coming a
     little bit more, a little bit more. Okay. Ninety
     degrees to that direction; that is the wrong 90,
     the other way. There we go. A little bit more.
     Nope, wrong way, wrong way; I am sorry. Keep
     coming in that direction. No, it is gone up at
     our 12 o'clock. There we go, it is coming back
     down. There we go, it's coming back down, it's
     coming back down. Bring it down a little bit
     more. Okay. Stop. Now we need 90 degrees to
     that direction again.

[02:07:22:54]
LMP: I hope that the next camera has a sight on it.

[02:07:22:58]
CC: Roger.

[02:07:23:11]
LMP: How is that?

[02:07:23:13]
CC: Well, that has disappeared, just practically.
     We were wondering if there was any chance of your
     looking out one of the other windows
     and seeing the moon? Hey, it is coming back in, Bill. Okay.
     Hold it right there. That is just fine for the
     earth right where you are. That is extremely good
     on the earth if you can just hold that.

[02:07:23:35]
_page : 2

CDR: I don't think we have - It has the polarizing filter
     in front of it now, Mike.

[02:07:23:53]
CC: Roger. Thank you, and it is centered very well.
     We get a very slight improvement with this, but
     in general, it is very good considering the distance.
     How about the moon, Frank? Is it visible
     through one of your other windows? Could you get
     it visible with a small maneuver?

[02:07:24:05]
CDR: Negative. I think we will have to save the moon
     for another time.

[02:07:24:08]
CC: Roger. I understand. You are still very well
     centered with your picture. We noticed a couple
     of jumps in the apparent intensity. Did you make
     some filter changes?

[02:07:24:37]
CDR: Roger. We tried to put that other red filter in
     front of it, but it didn't seem to fit.

[02:07:24:43]
CC: Roger.

[02:07:24:49]
CC: We would - On a final test when you get down to
     the end of your allotted time here, we would like
     you to remove all filters and let us see how it
     looks with all filters removed, and then we would
     like to get several spotmeter readings at the
     very end after the test.

[02:07:25:13]
_page : 4
CDR: Okay. We will be removing the red filter now.

[02:07:25:15]
CC: Roger.

[02:07:25:50]
CDR: Do you still have us, Mike? The lens is off now.

[02:07:25:53]
CC: Roger. We have it, and if you could maneuver it
     toward the terminator slightly, you would again
     center our picture.

[02:07:26:11]
CDR: Okay. Stand by. How's that? Is that the right
     direction?

[02:07:26:21]
CC: That is the right direction. Keep coming. Now
     that is the wrong direction, Frank. Did you - -

[02:07:26:44]
CDR: How is it now, Houston?

[02:07:26:46]
CC: Well, negative. I need another maneuver toward
     the terminator. It is drifting off the screen
     to our 11 o'clock. We appear to need a maneuver
     toward the terminator, Frank.

[02:07:27:08]
CDR: Thank you.

[02:07:27:17]
CC: No, that is apparently the wrong way, Frank. We
     are starting to lose the picture. There you go.
     That is the correct way.

[02:07:27:35]
CDR: Okay, Houston. How's that for today?

[02:07:27:39]
CC: That is just fine, Frank. That's great. We
     would like to, at the conclusion here, take
     three spotmeter readings. You can do that
     at any time at your convenience. We would just
     like to get some after-the-fact readings on the
     earth intensity.

[02:07:27:55]
_page : 5
CDR: Roger. Jim has got the spotmeter on now.

[02:07:27:57]

[02:07:28:00]
CC: Not quite, Frank.

[02:07:28:08]

     That's perfect.

CDR: Okay, earth. This is Apollo 8 signing off for
     today.

[02:07:28:29]

     you manana.

[02:07:28:34]

     so all is well. He says you're 10 minutes from
     the moon's sphere of influence.

CDR: Roger.

[02:07:33:54]
CC: You can tell Jim he is getting pretty ham-handed
     with that P21; he got a perilune altitude three-tenths
     of a mile off what we are predicting down
     here.

[02:07:34:08]
CDR: Is that right?

[02:07:34:09]
_page : 6
CC: Roger. Apparently, he got 69.7 and the RTC says
     70.

[02:07:34:18]

     to correct it to make it lower?

[02:07:34:24]

[02:07:50:25]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8. How are you reading on OMNI D?

CC: We are reading you loud and clear, Frank.

[02:07:50:32]
CDR: Okay. We are reading you like that, also. Thank
     you.

[02:07:50:38]
CC: We we having a playback of your TV shows and are
     all enjoying it down here. It was better than
     yesterday because it didn't preempt the football
     game.

[02:07:50:57]
CDR: Thank you. Don't tell me they cut off a football
     game; didn't they learn from Heidi?

[02:07:51:10]
CC: Well, you and Heidi are running neck and neck in
     the telephone call department.

[02:08:10:06]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[02:08:10:09]
CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8.

[02:08:10:12]
CDR: Hey, Jerry, how much water does this - the water
     dispenser in the lower equipment bay, the one
     that puts out hot and cold water - how much comes
     out of that with each shot?

[02:08:10:23]
CC: Stand by. I'll take a check on that. And, by the
     way, welcome to the moon's sphere.

[02:08:10:32]
CDR: The moon's fair?

[02:08:10:34]
CC: The moon's sphere - you're in the influence.

[02:08:10:39]
CDR: That's better then being under the influence.

[02:08:11:00]

[02:08:11:03]
CC: Go ahead, 8.

[02:08:11:07]

     a hat and informs me that it's 1 ounce per cycle.

     ground EECOM came to a dead heat on that one.

[02:08:11:39]

[02:08:11:40]
CC: Roger. We got the same answer at the same time.

[02:08:11:53]

     send it down to you.

[02:08:37:11]
LMP: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[02:08:37:13]
CC: Okay, 8. We want to run a little exercise on the
     ground here to make are that we're able to dump
     the tape and bring the voice portion back to
     Houston in a timely manner. So we plan to dump
     your tape, and we're going to exercise the procedure
     on the ground to get it back here and
     take a listen to it. We believe that we have
     something on the tape already unless you have
     recorded over it after the last dump. Just to
     make sure, we'd like to have you just say a few
     words, give us a short count or something on the
     tape and anything else that you might want to put
     on there. And we're going to do this in the next
     5 minutes before we get away from Madrid. That's
     the site we want to exercise, so we'll go ahead
     and do that, and we'll tell you before we make
     the dump.

[02:08:38:05]
LMP: Roger.

[02:08:44:20]

LMP: Houston, Houston, this is Apollo 8. Over.

[02:08:44:24]
CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8.

[02:08:44:29]
LMP: Okay. Ken, we put 8 few comments on the last of
     the tape after we heard from you, and it's being
     rewound now, and you can have it as soon as we
     get it back to the beginning.

[02:08:44:38]
CC: Okay. We'll have to wait. It looks like you are
     going out of the attitude to use high gain. We'll
     catch it next time around and then dump it.

[02:08:44:51]
LMP: Okay. I know this would be better in high bit
     rate, so it will probably take quite awhile.

[02:08:44:55]
CC: Alright.

[02:09:16:51]

     you could use the high gain?

[02:09:16:57]

[02:09:19:05]

[02:09:19:12]

[02:09:19:21]
LMP: We ought to also get a check on it at low bit
     rate for DSE voice, Ken.

[02:09:19:31]
CC: Apollo 8, are you saying that everything that's
     on there now is in high bit?.

[02:09:19:38]
LMP: That's where my switch was.

[02:09:19:40]
CC: Okay. We'll take a look at it then. If there
     wasn't anything that was previously recorded
     in low bit, then we'll come back and maybe take
     a look at that, too.

[02:09:19:52]
LMP: Okay. We might get ... if maybe we can get in
     a little closer to the moon to put as big a
     strain on it as we can.

[02:09:28:24]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[02:09:28:30]
LMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[02:09:28:31]
CC: Okay. We've completed the dump, and the tape
     recorder's back to you. You can use it any way
     you want. We may want to dump that thing again,
     and if we do we'll go ahead and use the same
     information unless you have something else that
     you specifically wanted to put on there later.
     Listening to the voice quality - it sounds real
     good. We're coming up on a midcourse 4 and right
     now it's - talking about doing it on time, and
     you can anticipate the burn in the neighborhood
     of 3 foot per second. We're considering and
     would like for you to think about the possibility
     of doing this burn using the onboard vector and
     just have us update the vector in the LM slot, so
     that you will have the MSFN vector on board. But
     it looks like it won't have any big effect on the
     burn results, and it might prove interesting. So
     if you think about that one for a bit and let us
     know if you have any suggestions or thoughts on
     the subject.

[02:09:28:39]
_page : 2
LMP: Roger. You say it uses the onboard vectors and
     leaves the MSFN vectors on the LM slot.

[02:09:29:45]
CC: That's affirmed, if that's what you would like to
     do, right. We considered it, and it looks like
     that would be a reasonable thing.

[02:09:29:55]
LMP: Roger. Frank and Jim are asleep now, and I'll
     bring this up to them when they wake up.

[02:09:30:03]
CC: Okay. Real fine.

[02:09:30:48]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. How about stirring up the
     oxygen?
     02093056 LMP Okay. Stand by.
     02100638 CC Apollo 8, Houston.

[02:10:06:43]
_page : 3
LMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[02:10:06:45]
CC: Okay, Bill. I guess I want to belay my last
     about using the onboard state vector for MCC 4.
     After looking at it some more on the ground,
     they've got to get going on making the PAD's
     and doing all their computations, and rather
     than put it off or do it twice, we're going to
     go ahead and go with the procedures we've been
     using all along. On the lunar orbit stuff,
     we've been looking it over and we got several
     guys - Jack Schmitt and company in the back
     room - looking at what effect your windows have.
     And, basically, it looks like there's two options
     that will make an impact on that REV 2.
     One of the options, of course, will be just to
     have you and Jim change seats and let Jim look
     out and get his SAM that way, and another option
     will be to roll the bird over and let Jim point
     the optics as far forward as he can get them and
     take his SAM through the telescope. And I guess
     we'd like to have any thoughts that you folks
     have on what you think you can do with the windows;
     if you have anything, we'd like to factor
     it into our thinking and go ahead and firm up
     our plans as early as we can. We'd like not to
     put it off so that we have none of these things
     to do after midcourse. You folks can probably
     tell us more about what you can do with those
     windows. So if you have any thoughts, go ahead
     and sing out with them, and we'll see what we
     can do about factoring that in.

[02:10:08:25]
_page : 4
LMP: Okay. With reference to the midcourse, I think
     that's generally agreed upon, that we do it like
     we've always been doing it. Now, with respect
     to the windows, center windows, essentially, are
     usable. The two side windows are - may be all
     right for observation, and the problem with the
     rendezvous windows is that they're pretty small.
     And I just thought we'd have to play the window
     game by ear almost. Not really sure what capability
     we're going to have. And we'll give you
     some more thoughts on this later.

[02:10:09:02]
CC: Okay. How about exercising the idea of rolling
     over and having Jim do his polarization through
     the telescope because if we have to change attitudes
     we'd like to go ahead and start thinking
     about what effects that'll have on such
     things as antenna orientation and all that.

[02:10:09:24]
LMP: Okay. We'll, I'll mention it to them when they
     wake up.

     and the REFSMMAT. So any time you're free with
     it, we can have P00 in ACCEPT; we'll go ahead
     with it.

[02:12:11:01]
CMP: In running through PROGRAM 52, we got a PROGRAM
     ALARM 401 which would indicate that if we continued,
     we'd drive it into gimbal lock.

[02:12:11:12]
CC: Roger. I understand.

[02:12:12:11]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. This should be an OPTION 1
     like OPTION 3.

[02:12:12:23]
_page : 3
CMP: Houston, we're doing an OPTION 1 like OPTION 3.
     We keep getting a 401 ALARM, which says desired
     RCTU yields gimbal lock.

[02:12:12:34]
CC: Roger. Stand by.

[02:12:19:14]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. It appears that you have
     maneuvered around the gimbal locks system.

[02:12:19:22]
CDR: Roger. Roger.

[02:12:19:25]
CC: Okay. Sorry we were late on that answer.

[02:12:19:30]
CDR: Thank you.

[02:12:21:20]
CC: Houston, Apollo 8.

[02:12:21:22]
CC: Go ahead.

[02:12:21:26]
CMP: Well, we stopped and went through coarse align
     of P52 and then we got fine align, and pick-a-pair,
     pick Capella, but she drove and didn't get
     to any place. I didn't pick Capella, and I can't
     recognize any out there right now. Can I re-cycle
     here and go back and pick a pair?

[02:12:21:54]
CC: That's affirmative, Apollo 8.

[02:12:25:27]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[02:12:25:30]
CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8.

[02:12:25:33]
CMP: My plan is to go back into re-enter PROGRAM 52 -
     well, it did not drive to Capella, and I can't
     recognize it in the scanning telescope. My plan
     is to go back into recall P52.

[02:12:25:50]
CC: Okay. Stand by one.

[02:12:25:54]
CC: Apollo 8, can you confirm that you zeroed the
     optics prior to starting?

[02:12:26:02]
_page : 4
CMP: Roger. That's affirmative. We zeroed the optics.

[02:12:26:32]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. You have a GO for a second
     try in P52 with an OPTION 3.

[02:12:26:43]
CMP: Okay. I now have Aldebaran in the scanning telescope;
     I might want to call that one instead of
     Capella.

[02:12:26:50]
CC: Okay.

[02:12:26:51]
CDR: I'll see what it comes up with first, though.

[02:12:32:23]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8. We came up with an unacceptable
     difference in our stars; we're going to have to
     recycle.

[02:12:32:29]
CC: Roger.

[02:12:32:33]
CDR: If we don't get this midcourse in, what will that
     do to our pericynthian?

[02:12:32:40]
CC: Stand by. We'll -

[02:12:32:57]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. In the event that we don't get
     this midcourse in, we'll still go for an LOI, and
     it's been suggested you might try Mirfak which is
     OCTO 10.

[02:12:33:12]
CDR: That's the one we're trying now.

[02:12:33:13]
CC: Roger.

[02:12:51:50]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[02:12:51:52]
CC: Go ahead.

[02:12:51:56]
CDR: We are all set up and counting down at 8 minutes.

[02:12:52:00]
CC: Roger.

[02:12:52:08]
_page : 5
CC: Apollo 8, our data is down right now; appreciate
     making sure you have the tape recorder on.

[02:12:52:19]
CDR: Roger. I am going to go - I'll have to go
     COMMAND RESET. You've got control.

[02:12:53:52]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[02:12:53:57]
CC: Go ahead.

[02:12:54:00]
CDR: Roger. You have some pitch and yaw angles for
     our PTC extra burn.

[02:12:54:14]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. That's pitch 348, yaw 315.

[02:12:54:25]
CDR: Pitch 348, yaw 315.

[02:12:54:30]
CC: That's affirmative. And would you give us another
     hack on your countdown time?

[02:12:54:39]
CDR: It's 518 17 16 15 14.

[02:12:54:45]
CC: Thank you.

[02:12:55:51]
CDR: Houston, I will give you a mark in 4 minutes.

[02:12:55:53]
CC: Alright. Thank you.

[02:12:55:54]
CDR: 3, 2, 1 -

[02:12:55:57]
CDR: MARK.

[02:12:55:58]
CDR: Four minutes.

[02:12:57:05]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. How about switching the
     BIOMED switch over to the left.

[02:12:57:12]
CDR: Roger. 3, 2, 1 -

[02:12:57:16]
CDR: MARK.

[02:12:57:18]
CDR: Switched.

[02:13:01:02]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[02:13:01:05]
CC: Go ahead.

[02:13:01:08]
_page : 6
CMP: Roger. Burn on time, angles nominal, burn time
     about 12 seconds, 0.2 feet per second after the
     DELTA-V<sub>C</sub>, 0 in VG<sub>X</sub>. We have transferred the results
     of the burn over to the left slot VERB 66.

[02:13:01:30]
CC: Roger. And got a couple of items that I would
     like to clean up. We will get you an RCS budget.
     We've got one redline now; we are trying to get
     some firmer numbers for you, and we will have
     those in a little bit. Right now your PTC usage
     is right on the flight plan line, so everything
     looks pretty good there. We want to get a crew
     status report from you. We would like to firm
     up the REV 2 flight plan idea; and sometime at
     your convenience, we would like to take a reading
     of the PRD for the commander and CMP and then
     have you swap them. We are trying to isolate
     the - what the possible reason is for the discrepancies
     or the disparity in the two readings.

[02:13:02:29]
CMP: Roger.

[02:13:02:58]
CMP: And we are maneuvering to the PTC attitude, Houston.

[02:13:03:01]
CC: Roger.

[02:13:05:17]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Could you give us the sign
     of that Z residual?

[02:13:05:40]
CMP: Stand by, Houston. Alright, Houston. Looks
     like we didn't record just the Z. We recorded
     DELTA V<sub>C</sub>, which is minus 0.2.

[02:13:06:16]
_page : 7
CC: Okay. Understand.

[02:13:06:17]
CMP: DELTA-V was 0.1, but we didn't get the sign.

[02:13:06:24]
CC: Roger. Understand that was DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> was minus
     0.2. I copied DELTA-V<sub>Z</sub>; ZULU is 0.2. Is that
     incorrect?

[02:13:06:39]
CMP: Roger. It was 0.1, but we didn't get the sign.

[02:13:06:44]
CC: Roger. Thank you.

[02:13:06:46]
LMP: We can get it. We have it on the tape, Houston,
     whenever you want to dump it.

[02:13:06:54]
CC: Roger. Thank you.

[02:13:06:57]
LMP: It'll be about the last 5 minutes worth.

[02:13:07:00]
CC: Roger.

[02:13:07:59]
LMP: Okay, Houston, for the PRD's: CDR is 0.07, CMP
     is 0.64, LMP is 0.80. Note that the CMP's hasn't
     changed since we started and the commander's
     hasn't changed much. We have swapped PRD's;
     commander has LMP, CMP has commander's, and LMP
     has CMP's PRD. Over.

[02:13:08:27]
CC: Okay. Thank you.

[02:13:09:53]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[02:13:09:57]
CC: Go ahead.

[02:13:10:01]
CMP: Roger. Crew status report as follows: water,
     the commander has about 50 clicks so far today;
     CMP 43; and the LMP is 44. We've eaten two meals
     so far today. Day 3 meal A and B; consumed most
     of it except for the hard hard bite, which no one
     cares for. Pudding was outstanding. We're at
     a gain of pericynthian now of plus 63 miles.
     Commander and CMP have had a rest period just
     before the midcourse 4 of about 2 hours.

[02:13:11:07]
_page : 8
CC: Roger.

[02:13:16:11]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[02:13:16:13]
CC: Go ahead.

[02:13:16:18]
CMP: We're at a gain of about 20 500 miles from the
     moon at 61:14. How does that agree with what
     you figure?

[02:13:19:16]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Looks like you're on the
     secondary loop. We would like to run that for
     about 5 minutes.

[02:13:19:28]
CDR: Roger. We're doing the ECS redundant component
     check.

[02:13:19:31]
CC: Roger. We'll follow.

[02:13:19:32]
CDR: Getting any data now Houston? Guess you are.
     Okay. See you stopped my tape then. I've been
     running for about 3 extra minutes here to record
     the check.

[02:13:19:45]
CC: Roger. We have data now. That was a temporary
     loss.

[02:13:19:55]
CDR: What's the matter? Was it chow time down there?

[02:13:19:58]
CC: Roger. Didn't know you could smell it that far
     away.

[02:13:20:13]
_page : 9
CDR: Give me a call when you're satisfied with the
     secondary loop; it's stabilized out here pretty
     well.

[02:13:20:18]
CC: Wilco, and you might tell Jim that our RTCC is
     about 4 miles off; we had 20 496.

[02:13:20:34]
LMP: Fine.

[02:13:21:07]
CDR: We just put compressor 2 on ac 2.

[02:13:22:23]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8. Do you show battery B as
     voltage dropped some from the postcharge value?
     Over.

[02:13:23:51]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Confirm that battery B is a
     little bit lower, and this is attributed to the
     parasitic loads that are on there.

[02:13:24:06]
LMP: Okay. I just didn't see the same kind of drop
     for A. So if you think it's okay, it's fine.

[02:13:24:11]
CC: That's affirm. You don't have the same parasitic
     loads on that; B is actually drawing some.

[02:13:24:20]
LMP: Okay. I guess that's the radiators, huh?

[02:13:24:39]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We've seen enough of the
     secondary evaporator. We would like for you to
     wait about 2 minutes between the time you go to
     RESET and the time you turn the pump off.

[02:13:24:53]
CDR: I agree; good idea. And we plan to leave the
     water control in AUTO.

[02:13:25:09]
CC: Roger.

[02:13:31:30]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[02:13:31:34]
_page : 10
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[02:13:31:37]
CC: Okay. Looking over the - our redundant component
     check, it appears we have not yet checked the
     integrity of the secondary loop radiators; and
     if you haven't done that, sometime we would like
     to open up the secondary radiators but not flow
     through them and just measure the accumulator
     pressure.

[02:13:32:03]
CDR: Stand by.

[02:13:32:42]
CDR: Houston, we don't show that in our pre-LOI check,
     but we're willing to go ahead and do it if you
     want to.

[02:13:32:50]
CC: Roger. We just noticed that it isn't there,
     and, yes, we would like to. You understand that
     we are not proposing that you flow, but merely
     we check for any pressure decay.

[02:13:33:10]
CDR: Roger. Wait till I get my trusty assistant here
     to help me.

[02:13:34:20]
CDR: Okay, Houston. We're going to blow the secondary,
     I mean, open the secondary RAD for 30 seconds now.

[02:13:34:27]
CC: Roger.

[02:13:34:38]
CDR: Looks pretty good.

[02:13:34:40]
CC: Sure does.

[02:13:35:05]
CDR: Okay. They're closed now.

[02:13:35:07]
CC: Okay. Thank you. Looks good.

[02:13:35:11]
CDR: Roger. No meteoroids yet.

[02:13:38:48]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. You take your tape recorder
     to stop, and we'll reset it then and give it back
     to you.

[02:13:39:00]
CDR: Roger. It's stopped.

[02:13:39:02]
CC: Thank you.
     END OF TAPE

[02:13:53:18]
_page : 1
_tape : Tape 42
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[02:13:53:23]
LMP: Go ahead.

[02:13:53:25]
CC: Okay. We still need to talk about the REV 2
     attitudes we're going to use here to work
     around the fact that you have a fogged center
     window. Whenever that's convenient, we'd like
     to go over what your thoughts are on the subject
     so we can make sure we can get our flight
     plan squared away.

[02:13:53:47]
LMP: My thoughts are to make - to do with the best
     with what we have. We are not interested in
     changing a lot of things right now.

[02:13:53:55]
CC: Okay. The one proposal that sounds like it
     has some advantage to it: if we let Jim do
     his evaluation through the telescope, you do
     everything exactly the same except you turn
     and roll over 180 degrees so that your head's
     up, and let Jim do his tracking through the
     telescope and you'll still be a yaw right when
     you go to pick up your TV and that type of
     thing. It looks like that probably will cover
     everything. We can do that or we can just go
     as is and just have to let some of that tracking
     evaluation go by. Another alternate would
     be to have Jim look out the right-hand rendezvous
     window, and you may have to change your
     attitude in order to get the same picture
     there also.

[02:13:55:08]
_page : 2
CDR: I think we'll try to do that, but I don't -
     this is one of the things that we'll work out
     when we get there.

[02:13:55:16]
CC: Okay. The reason we were looking into it in
     the flight plan is, if you do want to try
     rolling over and flying heads up or something
     of that nature, we can help Bill get a little
     more out of his photography by giving him
     some new film settings and that type of thing.
     We'll have something like that available; in
     case you do fly heads up, why, we'll have some
     numbers, we can call up for film settings.

[02:13:55:45]
CDR: Thank you.

[02:13:57:15]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[02:13:57:17]
CC: Go ahead.

[02:13:57:22]
CDR: Roger. We are going to have to dump more
     urine here shortly. Will this bother your
     tracking?

[02:13:57:42]
CC: Apollo 8, we're checking on that with the
     tracking people now.

[02:13:58:01]
CDR: Houston, just give us the time when we can
     start on it, and we'll hold off until you
     say so.

[02:13:58:06]
_page : 3
CC: Okay. Add you can anticipate a handover between
     stations here on the hour, and you might get a
     slight glitch as we go through. I'll give you a
     call when we get back.

[02:13:58:21]
CDR: Thank you, Ken. What station are we going to be
     going to, Ken?

[02:13:58:32]
CC: Okay. We'll be going to Honeysuckle.

[02:13:58:37]
CDR: Thank you.

[02:13:59:31]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. You're cleared for a dump at
     this time, and I understand this is the last gas
     station for a long time.

[02:13:59:42]
CDR: You mean you don't want us to dump after this
     for a while?

[02:13:59:45]
CC: That's affirm. Due to the tracking as you approach
     the LOI, they would like to minimize any
     of these type of perturbations.

[02:14:04:06]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston through Honeysuckle.

[02:14:04:11]
LMP: Roger. Houston through Honeysuckle. We read
     you loud and clear.

[02:14:04:15]
CC: Okay. Good morning.

[02:14:04:20]
LMP: Good morning.

[02:14:04:23]
CC: Thought you went to sleep.

[02:14:04:25]
LMP: You got over to Australia pretty fast.

[02:14:04:30]
CC: Roger. Did that gas station call wake you up?

[02:14:04:41]
LMP: Man, I've been all eyeballs and elbows here
     for the last several hours.

[02:14:04:57]
_page : 4
CC: I'll bet. If you've got nothing else to do, I do
     have two charts in your LOI table that I need
     to give you some update numbers on.

[02:14:05:04]
LMP: Standby.

[02:14:05:21]
LMP: We'll get our LOI tables man on the line here.
     Houston. Stand by.

[02:14:05:25]
CC: Roger.

[02:14:06:07]
CMP: Okay; Houston, CMP here. I understand you have
     some updates for me.

[02:14:06:12]
CC: Yes, sir; I've got a couple of charts in your
     chart book under LOI, and I have some numbers
     to fill in, one of them being the chart of LOI
     DELTA-V magnitude versus abort DELTA-V.

[02:14:06:35]
CMP: Okay. Stand by, and I'll get it out.

[02:14:06:37]
CC: Roger.

[02:14:07:04]
CMP: Okay, I have the chart out. Go ahead.

[02:14:07:06]
CC: Alright. Mode 1, 5 hours, roll 1.38, pitch
     7.89, yaw 357.37; Mode 1. 15 minutes, roll
     180.73, pitch 29.46, yaw 1.65. Over.

[02:14:08:11]
CMP: Roger. The new attitudes for the Mode 1,
     5 hour Mode 15 minute are as follows: roll
     1.38, pitch 7.89, yaw 357.37; Mode 1, 15 minute,
     roll 180.73, pitch 29.46, yaw 1.65.

[02:14:08:43]
CC: Okay. That is correct. Now I also have to give
     you a couple of points to plot on that curve.
     The present curve you have drawn is based on
     a 60-mile perigee or perilune, and you right
     now have a 62-mile pericynthian; and the reason
     that your target is for 62 miles is to pass over
     the landing site, so I have five sets of coordinates
     for you to copy.

[02:14:09:16]
_page : 5
CMP: Is this to go on the same chart to redraw the
     curve?

[02:14:09:19]
CC: That is affirmative.

[02:14:09:24]
CMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[02:14:09:27]
CC: Okay. We'll go in on the LOI DELTA-V magnitude
     1600, abort DELTA-V 2450, two-four-five-zero.

[02:14:09:59]
CMP: Okay. LOI DELTA-V magnitude 1600, abort DELTA-V
     2450. Stand by just one. I have it; continue.

[02:14:10:20]
CC: Okay. The next one is the LOI DELTA-V 2000,
     abort DELTA-V 3130.

[02:14:10:47]
CMP: Roger. I've got that plotted.

[02:14:10:51]
CC: 2400 LOI DELTA-V, abort DELTA-V 3880, three-eight-eight-zero.

[02:14:11:18]
CMP: I've got it plotted.

[02:14:11:20]
CC: 2800 LOI, abort DELTA-V 4700. over.

[02:14:11:46]
CMP: Roger. I have that one plotted, too.

[02:14:11:50]
CC: Alright. The last one is LOI DELTA-V 2990,
     abort DELTA-V 5114. That is almost directly
     into the end of the present curve, 5114.

[02:14:12:20]
CMP: Say again the LOI DELTA-V magnitude, please.

[02:14:12:24]
CC: Okay. LOI DELTA-V 2990.

[02:14:12:31]
_page : 6
CMP: Roger. 2990. Okay. I have it plotted.

[02:14:12:49]
CC: Alright. And on the next one, you should have
     a chart (number 10), and we have three numbers
     to go in there for a Mode 3 gimbal angle.

[02:14:13:06]
CMP: Roger. Go ahead with the Mode 3 gimbal angles.

[02:14:13:12]
CC: Roll 180.87, pitch 42.31, yaw 1.65.

[02:14:13:36]
CMP: Mode 3 gimbal angles are as follows: roll 180.87,
     pitch 42.31, yaw 1.65.

[02:14:13:48]
CC: Roger. That is correct.

[02:14:13:56]
CMP: Could you please send up a French curve for
     me?

[02:14:14:00]
CC: Roger.

[02:14:14:03]
CDR: Send up a couple.

[02:14:14:07]
CC: The only one I have is about 6 foot.

[02:14:14:18]
CDR: Houston, could you give us some gimbal angles

     the whole trip, and I'm wondering which way
     it is from us now.

CMP: Roger.

[02:14:16:47]
CC: We are getting ready to give you a rundown on
     your systems. We're going over all the final
     steps, and we will tell you what we see in
     the way of trajectory and systems information.
     And once again, Dr. Joe Kerwin has brought over
     all the latest news, and we can read that up
     to you a little bit at a time if you don't go
     to sleep.

     Journal?

[02:14:17:20]
CC: Roger.

[02:14:17:23]
CMP: Go ahead. We are all ears.

[02:14:17:25]
CC: Okay. Here is one: the previously scheduled
     72-hour cease fire by the Viet Cong went into
     effect today, 17 hours before the allied true
     was to begin.

[02:14:17:57]
CDR: You lost us on the numbers there. What was
     that again?

[02:14:18:04]
CC: The gist of it was that the VC went into a
     cease fire earlier than the truce that we had
     planned on, as a Christmas holiday type.

[02:14:18:25]
CDR: Roger. Good.

[02:14:21:36]
CDR: Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.

[02:14:21:38]
CC: Loud and clear. Sorry to have stopped on you
     there. We are going over the summary of the
     systems data.

[02:14:21:49]
CDR: Okay.

[02:14:31:19]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[02:14:31:24]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[02:14:31:26]
_page : 8
CC: Okay. I have a rundown on your systems here,
     GNC status. Everything looks real --

[02:14:31:38]
CDR: Just a minute.

[02:14:31:42]
CC: Go ahead.

[02:14:31:52]
CDR: I want to wait until the LMP gets on the head
     set, Houston.

[02:14:31:55]
CC: Roger.

[02:14:33:11]
CMP: Okay, Houston, go ahead. EECOM's on the line.

[02:14:33:19]
CC: Okay. We'll just start with EECOM business,
     then I'll give you a summary of your batteries;
     battery A, we calculate 38.3 amp-hours, battery B --

[02:14:33:36]
CMP: Stand by a second, Ken.

[02:14:33:46]
CDR: Let me get my chart out.

[02:14:33:49]
CC: Roger.

[02:14:33:53]
CDR: Go ahead now.

[02:14:33:55]
CC: Okay. Battery A 38.3, battery B 36.9, battery
     C, 38.5. That's looking pretty good.
     It looks like we got all the things back in
     that we took out, and we're running right
     along prediction. We would like to get a
     battery C voltage from you if you can just
     reach over there and switch it.

[02:14:34:28]
CDR: Roger. Thirty-seven volts, on battery C.

[02:14:34:34]
CC: Roger. Thirty-seven volts, Okay. The predicted
     cryo quantities at SEP: on oxygen
     tank 1 170, oxygen tank 2 170, hydrogen 1 9.5,
     and hydrogen 2 10.0. You essentially have
     single cryo tank capabilities all the way at
     full power now.

[02:14:35:14]
_page : 9
CDR: Fine.

[02:14:35:17]
_extra : Ken misspoke, next line meant high-gain, not OMNIs
CC: The secondary coolant loop really looked
     good. Looks like you had a nice tight radiator
     and everything else on there was working
     right along the performance curves. Your
     main oxygen regulators both filled at 104 psi
     during our check. Looking at the lunar orbit,
     expect to be doing a water boil of about
     1 pound per hour, and this is just an approximation;
     there's quite a variety of estimates
     as to what the water boiling requirements may
     be, might go anywhere from boiling lots to
     not boiling at all. The next water dump will
     be coming up after TEI, so you don't have to
     worry about any of that until you get through.
     Communications predictions are looking good,
     possibly a little bit better than what we had
     hoped for, and looks like we're going to get
     high bit rate on OMNI's with our 210-foot
     dish at Goldstone. This will be working for
     us on the first couple of rev's, and then
     we'll be switching sites, so we'll go back
     to using OMNI's for high bit. The voice quality
     on DSE is good. Your fuel cells have been running
     above nominal for the entire flight, and
     they really look nice and stable. There's been
     some destratification -

[02:14:37:04]
_page : 10
LMP: ... on normal voice, doesn't it?

[02:14:37:11]
CC: Okay. Looks like may not be able to hack the
     normal voice. On the cryo tanks, we've had
     quite a bit of destratification, particularly
     in the oxygen, and you notice this during the
     fan cycles and DELTA-V's, so we're going to be
     sure and we'll remind you again to stir up the
     oxygen prior to LOI. CMC is running along like
     clockwork. G&C tells us that the RCS quantities
     are looking good. You're using the same amount
     as predicted for your PTC and for your alignment.
     What we have in the way of a redline:
     we're going to tell you that you can use
     30 percent per quad in lunar orbit. Now this
     is quite a bit of fuel to play with, and you
     can take 30 percent and subtract that from
     what you have to completion of LOI, and that
     will be a good number.

[02:14:38:27]
CC: On the SPS, the oxidizer and fuel feed line
     temperatures are 75 and holding steady. The
     service module RCS quad package temps are
     cycling and holding between 120 and 140, and
     looks like we're getting good normal heater
     operations. We plan to have you in a 60-mile
     circular orbit after LOI 2. And we should
     have some PAD's for you on the LOI burn at
     about 67 hours.

[02:14:39:30]
_page : 11
CDR: Roger. We got all that.

[02:14:39:32]
CC: Okay. We're still going through the tracking,
     and as you know, we're going to hold down on
     the water dumps and so forth during the last
     couple of hours in and out, sort of aid the
     tracking procedures. Everything is running
     along the line normally now. Do you have any
     other specific questions? We are looking for
     an angle on the moon. I guess that about summarizes
     the system. Everything looks GO right
     now.

[02:14:40:06]
CDR: Okay, Ken. Thank you. We just completed
     day 3 meal C, and now are going to break up and
     each take a rest period before LOI.

[02:14:40:18]
CC: Okay, real fine. Everybody wanted to ask
     if you wouldn't try and get some sack time
     here before we go in. It's going to be a big
     day.

     have you stir up the oxygen cryo.

[02:15:10:19]
CDR: Okay, I'll do that right now. Just a moment,
     just the oxygen?

[02:15:10:26]

     hydrogen.

[02:15:10:29]

CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go.

[02:21:49:47]
CMP: Roger. For information, we're passing over just
     to the side of the crater Langrenus at this time
     going into the Sea of Fertility.

[02:21:49:57]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Roger.

[02:21:51:04]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. What does the ole moon look
     like from 60 miles? Over.

[02:21:51:16]
CMP: Okay, Houston. The moon is essentially gray,
     no color; looks like plaster of Paris or sort
     of a grayish deep sand. We can see quite a bit
     of detail. The Sea of Fertility doesn't stand
     out as well here as it does back on earth.
     There's not as much contrast between that and
     the surrounding craters. The craters are all
     rounded off. There's quite a few of them; some
     of them are newer. Many of them look like -
     especially the round ones - look like hits by
     meteorites or projectiles of some sort. Langrenus
     is quite a huge crater; it's got a central cone to
     it. The walls of the crater are terraced, about
     six or seven different terraces on the way down.

[02:21:52:35]
_page : 5
CC: Roger. Understand.

[02:21:52:40]
CMP: And coming up now, the Sea of Fertility are the
     old friends Messier and Pickering that I looked
     about so much on earth.

[02:21:52:49]
CC: Roger.

[02:21:52:50]
CMP: And I can see the rays coming out of blaze Pickering.
     We're coming up now near our P-1 initial site
     which I'm going to try and see. Be advised the
     round window, the hatch window, is completely iced
     over; we can't use it; Bill and I are sharing the
     rendezvous window.

[02:21:53:15]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. Got any more information
     on those rays? Over.

[02:21:53:24]
LMP: Roger. The rays out of Pickering are quite faint
     from here; there are two different groups going
     to the left. They don't appear to have any depth
     to them at all, just rays coming out.

[02:21:53:42]
CC: Roger.

[02:21:53:45]
CMP: They look like just changes in the color of the
     mare.

[02:21:54:08]
CC: Bill, if you can tear yourself away from that window,
     we'd like you to turn off the secondary evaporator.
     Over.

[02:21:54:53]
CMP: Stand by.

[02:21:54:54]
LMP: Roger.

[02:21:55:28]
CMP: Okay. Over to my right are the Pyrenees Mountains
     coming up, and we're just about over Messier and
     Pickering right now. Our first initial point is
     easily seen from our altitude. We're getting quite
     a bit of contrast as we appear - as we approach the
     terminator. The view appears to be good, no reflection
     of the sun back to our eyes; it appears that
     visibility at this particular spot is excellent.
     It's very easy to pick out our first initial point;
     and over this mountain chain, we can see the second
     initial point, the Triangular Mountain.

[02:21:56:33]
LMP: And we're coming upon the craters Colombo and 
     Gutenberg. Very good detail visible. We can
     see the long parallel faults or grabens, and they
     run through the Mare material right into the highland
     material.

[02:21:57:41]
LMP: We're directly over our first initial point now
     for P-1. It's almost impossible to miss, very easy
     to pick out, and we can look right over into the
     second initial point.

[02:21:57:56]

     please?

[02:21:58:51]
CC: Roger.

[02:21:59:19]
CMP: Okay. I've got P-1 in sight now, Houston.

[02:21:59:30]
CC: Roger, Jim.

[02:21:59:32]
CMP: It's very easy to spot. You can see the entire
     rims of the craters from here with, of course,
     the white crescent on the far side where the sun
     is shining on it. The shadows are quite lengthy
     now. Maskelyne B (Marsh of Sleep) has quite a
     few shadows off of it, but it can be recognized.
     Just west of the Maskelyne B, we start going to
     the terminator. The terminator is actually quite
     sharp over the Pyrenees, and it's - I can't see
     anything in earthshine at this present time. Bill
     says that he can see things out the side window
     when he's not looking down on the sunshine on the
     moon.

     rate for a while.

[02:22:01:26]

[02:22:01:45]

     Of Sleep) now, and our target is just directly
     below us.

     Over.

[02:22:09:13]
LMP: Earthshine is about as expected, Houston. Not
     as much detail, of course, as in the sunlight,
     but you can see the large craters quite distinctly,
     and you can see the albedo contacts quite distinctly.
     And, also, the - there's a good three-dimensional
     view of the rims of the larger craters.

[02:22:09:43]

CC: Roger.

[02:22:12:44]
LMP: Go ahead with your information on the filter,
     Houston.

[02:22:12:47]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. We recommend you
     use a wide-angle lens on this particular TV run.
     You can use a telephoto lens with the same setup
     as yesterday's TV show. However, we recommend
     a wide-angle lens. Step number 1, tape the single
     red filter to the red filter on the red/blue
     0 filter holder; do it so that the filter slide still
     functions. Over.

[02:22:13:38]
LMP: Go ahead.

[02:22:13:40]
CC: Roger. Step number 2, attach the filter holder
     to the lens with the tape on the top and bottom;
     do this with the slide forward. Over.

[02:22:14:04]
CDR: Go ahead.

[02:22:14:05]
CC: Roger. Then at the end of your second REV TV pass,
     or on request from here, we would like you to remove
     that red filter from the holder and transmit briefly
     with it that way, then slide it over the blue side
     for your final transmission. Over.

[02:22:14:27]

     in BANK B, not a chug, but we could feel additional thrust.

[02:22:16:37]
CC: Roger. Copy.

[02:22:16:44]
LMP: Houston, be advised on this red/blue filter
     technique on the TV. You cannot slide the two
     filters out of the way with them taped onto the
     TV camera; so I suggest we do red, blue, and then
     take them off.

[02:22:17:06]
CC: Roger. We concur, but make sure the little red
     filter is taped over the big one. Over.

[02:22:17:20]
LMP: Alright, you don't want the red fil - you want the
     blue by itself. Is that correct?

[02:22:17:25]
CC: That's affirmative, Bill.

[02:22:17:33]
CC: Bill, we'd like you to use the double red filter
     for the first transmission. Over.

LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. Over.

[02:22:48:15]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go.

[02:22:48:20]
LMP: Are you going to be able to dump that tape prior
     to LOS?

[02:22:48:30]
CC: Roger. Bill, they say they have already dumped
     the tape, and it's almost totally clean.

[02:22:48:42]
LMP: What does that mean?

[02:22:48:52]
CC: That means you have get about 2 minutes of low
     bit rate on there, but the rest is clean. Over.

[02:22:48:59]
LMP: The high bit rate of the burn wasn't on there?

[02:22:49:03]
CC: Negative. We've already dumped and got that.

[02:22:49:18]
LMP: Okay. Let me know when you're going to dump it
     next time, Jerry. I understand we are GO now
     on the DSE. Have you got any voice off of it?

[02:22:49:26]
CC: That's affirmative. We did.

[02:22:49:31]
LMP: Okay. Thank you.

[02:22:50:10]
_page : 15
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. The voice quality on your tape
     was just fair-to-middling; we were able to monitor
     your burn and hear most of that pretty well.

[02:22:50:27]
LMP: Roger. Did you get a report of the photography
     accomplished, or is that on the tape at present?

[02:22:50:36]
CC: Negative. We haven't heard that.

[02:22:50:42]
LMP: Okay. We will put it on the tape now.

LMP: Houston, this is Apollo 8 with the TV going.
     Over.

[02:23:41:00]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. Reading you loud
     and clear. We see your TV. It is a little
     bit - little bit clearer.

[02:23:41:15]
LMP: Roger. The moon is very bright and not too
     distinct in this area. I will give you a shot
     of the horizon.

[02:23:41:21]
CC: Roger.

[02:23:41:25]
LMP: How's that look? Is it on the top of your
     picture?

[02:23:41:30]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. It's a good picture
     - the horizon - we can't see many terrain
     features as yet.

[02:23:41:41]
LMP: Roger.

[02:23:41:48]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We are beginning to pick
     up a few craters very dimly; the whole thing
     is pretty bright.

[02:23:41:58]
LMP: Roger. There is not much definition up here
     either out on the horizon. We are now
     approaching the craters See and Bassett.

[02:23:42:06]
CC: Roger.

[02:23:42:15]
LMP: I'll shift to the rendezvous window.

[02:23:42:18]
_page : 2
CC: Roger, Bill..

[02:23:42:22]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We want to take the DSE.

[02:23:42:28]
LMP: Roger. You've got it.

[02:23:42:29]
CC: Roger. Looks like we've got a real good picture
     now.

[02:23:42:35]
LMP: Okay. That's the crater Brand.

[02:23:42:37]
CC: Roger.

[02:23:42:42]
LMP: Sorry we missed Carr.

[02:23:42:43]
CC: Me, too.

[02:23:42:54]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. We are going to
     need a cryo fan cycle sometime during this pass.

[02:23:43:02]
LMP: Roger. Can we wait till sunset?

[02:23:43:06]
CC: Roger. We can wait.

[02:23:43:10]
LMP: okay. I think we are coming up on Miller
     right now.

[02:23:43:53]
LMP: There's a very new bright impact crater; should
     be in the field of view now.

[02:23:44:01]
CC: Roger, Bill.

[02:23:44:05]
LMP: You see it in the upper part of your screen.

[02:23:44:10]
CC: Say, Bill, how would you describe the color of
     the moon from here?

[02:23:44:14]
LMP: The color of the moon looks like a very whitish
     gray, like dirty beach sand with lots of footprints
     in it.

[02:23:44:23]
CMP: Some of these craters look like pickaxes striking
     concrete leaving a lot of fine haze dust.

[02:23:44:38]
_page : 3
LMP: There's some interesting features out on the
     other window. Let me switch windows on you now.

[02:23:44:41]
CC: Roger, Bill.

[02:23:44:48]
LMP: You should see the horizon now in the top of
     your picture.

[02:23:44:51]
CC: Roger. We have the horizon, Bill.

[02:23:45:01]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[02:23:45:02]
LMP: I believe these are the craters now Bassett
     and See.

[02:23:45:07]
CC: Roger, Bill. If you have the polarizing
     filter handy, try flipping it in front, would
     you?

[02:23:45:15]
LMP: Roger.

[02:23:45:18]
CMP: Jerry, as a matter of interest, there's a lot
     of what appears to be very small new craters
     that have these little white rays radiating
     from them.

[02:23:45:29]
CC: Roger, Jim.

[02:23:45:50]
CC: Roger. We see the filter going over it.
     Apollo 8, this is Houston. Looks like we have
     too much light. The polarizing filter doesn't
     help much. Go ahead and remove it again.

[02:23:46:16]
LMP: Roger. It's removed.

[02:23:46:25]
CC: Looks like we just got --

LMP: Roger. We're just passing over the crater
     Borman, and there's Anders out there; Lovell
     is right south of it.

[02:23:46:33]
_page : 4
CC: Roger. The TV is breaking up now. Okay. We
     are back with a good picture. Looks like we
     just have too much light. Our definition is
     rather weak.

[02:23:46:49]
LMP: Roger.

[02:23:47:01]
LMP: Also, we're fogging up the window here, Houston,
     among other problems.

[02:23:47:06]
CC: Roger, Bill. The other window is better than
     that one.

[02:23:47:12]
LMP: Okay.

[02:23:47:21]
CC: Much better picture, Bill; much better.

[02:23:47:25]
LMP: Alright. The right side of the camera is
     pointing retrograde. We are now passing abeam
     of the crater Houston; I will show the camera
     over there once for the folks in Texas.

[02:23:47:47]
CC: Roger.

[02:23:47:53]
LMP: It's a big and sprawly one; it's got those
     two impact craters, one to the right and one
     to the left.

[02:23:48:03]
CC: Roger, Bill.

[02:23:48:13]
LMP: How's your picture?

[02:23:48:15]
CC: Still about the same, Bill. It's - the terrain's
     pretty bright. We are not getting much definition
     at all; definition on this side is much
     much better.

[02:23:48:26]
LMP: Okay. I think - Okay. We are leaving the
     window; that gives you an idea how bad our
     window is.

[02:23:48:34]
_page : 5
CC: Roger. This picture now is much better; I
     guess the light levels are decreasing now.

[02:23:48:42]
LMP: okay. We are coming up on the crater Collins.

[02:23:48:45]
CC: Roger. What crater is that just going off.

[02:23:48:52]
LMP: That's some small impact crater.

[02:23:48:56]
CC: Roger.

[02:23:48:57]
LMP: We will call it John Aaron's.

[02:23:48:59]
CC: Okay.

[02:23:49:04]
LMP: If he'll keep looking at the system anyway.

[02:23:49:06]
CC: He just quit looking.

[02:23:49:19]
CMP: Jerry, another ID feature: these small impact
     craters have dark spots in the center where it
     appears that they buried in it and hit some
     new material down below and scattered a lot
     of fine white dust around them.

[02:23:49:32]
CC: Roger. Understand, Jim.

[02:23:49:39]
CC: Apollo 8. This is Houston. Looks like we
     could see Collins now.

[02:23:49:48]
LMP: Roger. There is Collins for you.

[02:23:49:52]
CMP: And Collins is right on the edge of Smythe's
     Sea which we are about to pass over.

[02:23:49:57]
CC: Roger.

[02:23:50:24]
CC: Apollo 8. This is --

[02:23:50:26]
LMP: We are now going across the Smythe Sea. Go
     ahead.

[02:23:50:31]
_page : 6
CC: Roger. We just saw a Stellenword go by.

[02:23:50:39]
LMP: Roger. He was really in a hurry.

[02:23:50:45]
CC: Roger. Picture is much improved now; getting
     better all the time.

[02:23:50:51]
LMP: Roger. The terrain here is, as you can see,
     not well defined. We are going to start a
     roll to the left, in order to come across the
     target area, with the television --

[02:23:51:15]
CC: Roger.

[02:23:51:16]
LMP: -- landing site area.

[02:23:51:18]
CC: Roger, Bill.

[02:23:51:38]
LMP: How is that crater in - right in the middle
     look now?

[02:23:51:41]
CC: Roger. That's a very good one; that must be
     O'Neal.

[02:23:51:49]
LMP: Roger.

[02:23:52:09]
CC: Roger, Bill. We see O'Neal real well, also
     the smaller crater off to the side of it.

[02:23:52:19]
LMP: That's Dennis.

[02:23:52:21]
CC: Roger.

CDR: Houston, this is Apollo 8. We are going to
     terminate our program for this pass and get on

[02:23:55:10]
CC: Roger. Apollo 8, on your backside data, it's
     pretty much unintelligible. We suggest, Bill,
     that you recheck the position of your mike for
     your backside pass and try to speak a little
     bit louder and more distinctly. The last one
     we listened to, was pretty much unintelligible.

     Messier and Pickering.

[03:00:04:23]

     There is no trouble picking out
     features that we learned on the map.

[03:00:04:33]
CC: Roger. Jim, that's good news. What do you
     think of the lighting situation as far as the
     range of lighting for good visibility?

[03:00:04:46]
_page : 10
CMP: The range from here is outstanding.
     I wish we had the TV still going because the brown
     area now is darker. We have just passed over
     the Sea of Fertility, and the mare is darker.
     The mountain range has got more contrast, has
     more contrast because of the sun angle. Bill's
     got the 16 mm going for us.

[03:00:05:10]
CC: Roger.

[03:00:05:13]
CMP: There is a crater Taruntius, I believe, over
     there.

[03:00:06:18]
CMP: Houston, at these sun angles, everything is
     quite distinct; shadows are good; the ground
     doesn't have any sunlight returned. It appears
     very good visibility at these sun angles.

[03:00:06:30]
CC: Roger.

[03:00:07:02]
CMP: As a matter of fact, Bill just mentioned that
     the visibility seems to be excellent just about
     up to the terminator. It's something which I
     didn't expect. I thought there would be a
     little bit more gradual shift to darkness, but
     it's very sharp and distinct.

     dumped.

     that if you rewind and start low bit rate,

[03:00:38:17]
CDR: Go ahead.

[03:00:38:18]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. You are right;
     the REFSMMAT is LOI 2. The REFSMMAT was determined
     out there before the last midcourse
     correction, and since that time, there has
     been a slight change of trajectory, and the
     point at which you are burning LOI 2 now is
     just a shade different than where it was
     originally planned. Over.

CC: Roger. For Bill - the voice quality on the backside
     DSE is extremely poor. We consider it unusable,
     and we recommend that all pertinent comments be
     hand recorded so we don't lose them. We should
     not count on using the tape at low bit rate for
     voice.

LMP: Okay, Houston. We're getting so busy that we
     are having a hard time trying to do a neat job
     of logging. I'll try to do it on the flight
     plan; and if I make any visual observations,
     we'll put them on the DSE, and I'll try to
     scribble some notes here and there.

     like to, if we could, time the TV to a passing over
     the terminator. We would like to track the
     terminator with the TV; think that's the most
     impressive thing we've seen, and that might be
     the best thing rather than trying to acquire
     the earth.

[03:02:41:07]
CC: Okay, Frank. That's one of the things we are

     12 and targets 10, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, and 23.
     Unfortunately, we got into a high - I got into
     the high-speed film there somewhere, and I think
     those 250mm targets were on high speed. We did
     change film, and starting out in Tex - Crater,
     Texas, with target 28, 31, 40, 36, plus several
     targets of opportunity that were recorded on the
     DSE, but apparently lost. Have you been able to
     copy?

[03:02:43:13]
CC: Yes, I'm with you, Bill. Keep going.

[03:02:43:18]
LMP: Okay. I might be calling up too fast. Okay.
     On the third REV, we got target 58 and 63 and 65.
     The training photography was accomplished, and it
     was done on magazine D, which now has - correction,
     that's magazine E - which now shows 95 exposures.
     Magazine D is fresh. Magazine K was also used for
     training photography, and it's showing 0.51.

[03:02:44:22]
CC: Roger. We copy all that, Bill.

[03:02:44:40]
CDR: Go ahead.

[03:02:44:41]
CC: Roger for Bill.

[03:02:44:42]
CDR: ... around.

[03:02:44:46]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston standing by.

[03:02:44:51]
CDR: I said is Rod Rose around?

[03:02:44:54]
CC: Stand by one, Frank; we'll look for him, and
     while we're doing that, for Bill the DSE voice
     quality on high bit rate is very good, so if
     he wants to use the DSE in high bit rate for a
     limited amount of time to record important
     things, we suggest that he do that. We would
     like him to wait 20 seconds after turning it
     on prior to talking. Over.

[03:02:45:28]
LMP: Roger. Copy.

[03:02:45:30]
CC: Thank you, Bill.

CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[03:02:45:43]
CDR: Go ahead.

[03:02:45:44]
CC: Rod Rose is sitting up in the viewing room; he
     can hear what you say.

[03:02:45:50]
CDR: I wonder if he is ready for experiment P1?

[03:02:45:56]
CC: He says thumbs up on P1.

[03:02:46:04]
LMP: Houston, with reference to the DSE on high bit
     rate, what I would like to do this is - if you
     got the last pass - I'd like to play it - run it
     back and start at AOS on low bit rate and then go to
     high when we need it. How would that be?

[03:02:46:27]
_page : 7
CC: John Aaron buys it.

[03:02:46:32]
CDR: Okay, Mike. This is Frank again.

[03:02:46:36]
CC: Go.

[03:02:46:40]
CDR: Roger. Rod and I got together, and I was
     going to record a little - say a little prayer
     for our church service tonight. And I wonder -
     I guess that's what we are ready on?

[03:02:46:56]
CC: Stand by one, Frank.

[03:02:47:00]
CDR: Alright.

[03:02:49:41]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8. Are you still there?

[03:02:49:43]
CC: You're still loud and clear, Frank.

[03:02:50:01]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead, Frank, with your
     message.

[03:02:50:07]
CDR: okay. This is to Rod Rose and the people at
     St. Christopher's, actually to people everywhere.
     Give us, O God, the vision which can see thy love
     in the world, in spite of human failure. Give us
     the faith to trust the goodness in spite of our
     ignorance and weakness. Give us the knowledge
     that we may continue to pray with understanding
     hearts, and show us what each one of us can do
     to set forth the coming of the day of universal
     PEACE. Amen.

[03:02:50:35]
CC: Amen.

[03:02:52:07]
CDR: Roger. Go ahead.

[03:02:52:09]
CC: Roger. Frank, we'd like to know about the water
     chlorination. Have you - when was the last time
     you chlorinated the water? Over.

[03:02:52:16]
CDR: About an hour and a half ago; we've already done it.

[03:02:52:22]
CC: Roger. We copy you an hour and a half ago.
     Affirmative?

[03:02:52:28]
CDR: Roger. You know we wouldn't forget that.

[03:02:52:36]
CC: Roger.

[03:02:52:40]
CDR: Jim spilled a little, and it smelled like a
     bucket of Clorox about an hour ago.

[03:02:52:51]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Say again.

[03:02:52:57]
CDR: I said Jim inadvertently spilled some of that
     chlorine, and it smelled like a bucket of
     Clorox in here for a little while.

[03:02:53:06]
CC: Roger. Understand.

     looking just fine down here, Frank.

[03:02:59:02]
CDR: Thank you.

[03:02:59:06]
CC: We'll have some more information on the TV on
     the next rev. We're not planning any big change
     in the time, just to extend them a little bit, I
     think, closer to the terminator.

[03:02:59:21]
CDR: Just give us the time, will you, because we just
     want to know when it is. I'd like to get the
     terminator if we could, and we've got a little
     message, and that's it.

[03:02:59:29]
CC: Roger. We'll do that the next time you come
     around.

[03:02:59:32]
CDR: Thank you. Okay. And have the EECOM guys keep
     a sharp watch on our systems. Old Anders is so
     busy fooling around with these pictures that -
     not much else is getting done.

     better lock on you.

[03:03:54:11]
CC: As long as you're reading me okay, Frank, I'll
     bring you up to date on a couple of things. The
     P27 which we will be sending you is a state vector
     update going to the LM slot, and we'd like to -
     as per plan - to transfer that to the CSM slot by
     a VERB 47 ENTER, and we would like to just remind
     you that prior to doing your VERB 47 ENTER manually
     select P00 and wait for the computer activity light
     to go out. Did you copy? Over.

[03:04:06:35]
CC: That is affirmative. We are getting low bit data
     now.

[03:04:06:41]
LMP: okay. I've played - run the tape recorder back
     to the beginning. We have quite a bit of high
     bit, so all you'll have to do is start recording
     when you are ready.

[03:04:06:55]
CC: Roger. Stand by one, Bill.

[03:04:07:27]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Stand by one on the tape
     recorder dump. We would like you to look at your
     steam pressure. We think that the primary evaporator
     may have dried out, and if the steam pressure
     shows off-scale low, would you please close the
     back pressure valve and reservice the evaporator?
     Over.

[03:04:18:19]
LMP: Roger. You can go ahead now and give you computer
     and get the updates, and let's get going on the
     PAD messages.

[03:04:18:26]
CC: Roger.

[03:04:18:36]
LMP: It is in P00 and ACCEPT.

[03:04:18:44]
LMP: Okay, Houston. Are you ready to talk about the
     water boiler problem?

[03:04:18:49]
CC: Roger. We copy you in P00 and ACCEPT, and we
     are sending you a P27 LM state vector. On the
     water boiler, it looks to us like the evaporator
     has been reserviced. How does it look to you?
     Over.

[03:04:19:06]
LMP: Roger. I reserviced it, put it to AUTO - H<sub>2</sub>O
     flow to AUTO; and the steam pressure went to
     zero again. So I tried reservicing it the second
     time for 1 minute, and again no results. I'm in
     the present process of closing the back pressure
     valve manually. Over.

[03:04:19:25]
CC: Roger. Understand you tried to reservice it twice,
     both times steam pressure has gone to zero, and
     now you are closing the back pressure valve manually.

[03:04:19:36]
LMP: Roger. Each time I have reserviced it, the steam
     pressure came up to about 0.07 to 0.1; but as soon
     as the steam and water were put to AUTO, the
     steam pressure went right back down again.

[03:04:20:01]
_page : 6
CC: Roger. We copy, and we are reading you loud
     and clear now, Bill. On your map update, did
     you copy that that I gave you previously?

[03:04:20:13]
CMP: Negative. We have not copied it yet.

[03:04:20:14]
LMP: Negative.

[03:04:20:17]

     ready to copy.

[03:04:20:24]

CC: Apollo 8. Houston.

[03:04:23:32]
LMP: Go.

[03:04:23:33]
CC: Roger. On your back pressure valve, we would like
     to know how long after you closed the back pressure
     valve the first time - how long it was from the time
     you closed it until the time you started the reservicing?
     We would like for you to wait about 15 minutes
     to prevent any ice from forming due to flash freezing.
     Over.

[03:04:23:59]
LMP: Okay. I started immediately to reservice it.

[03:04:24:17]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We show that you closed it this
     last time about 4 minutes ago, so we would like you
     to wait another 15 minutes and then try to reservice
     it again at that time and then go to AUTO. Over.

[03:04:24:41]
LMP: Roger.

[03:04:24:43]
CC: Roger. Thank you. The TEI 4 PAD which you have
     is still valid. We will have a TEI 5 PAD for you
     shortly.

[03:04:24:55]
LMP: Roger. Be advised we are presently in steam pressure
     MANUAL, and we're in H<sub>2</sub>O flow AUTO, and are now in
     H<sub>2</sub>O flow OFF, as of about 5 seconds ago.

[03:04:25:15]
CC: Roger. We copy that, Bill. And we confirm that's a
     good configuration.

[03:04:25:28]
LMP: Right now, I've got the H<sub>2</sub> flow OFF. Do we stay
     that way?

[03:04:25:32]
_page : 8
CC: Affirmative.

[03:04:25:45]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. On your television update,
     we propose that you start the TV at the flight
     plan time of 85 hours 37 minutes and simply
     extend the stop time a few minutes. You're
     currently scheduled to stop at 86 hours, and we
     would like to keep it going until the terminator,
     which should be approximately 86:14. Over.

[03:04:41:56]
LMP: If we have a problem, a similar problem, again
     on the back side in the sunlight, might be a
     good idea to crank the secondary loop until
     we have AOS. What do you think about that?

[03:04:43:25]
CC: Roger, Jim. In regard to your evaporator, we
     feel that if you do have a similar problem
     next time on the back side in sunlight, check
     the evaporator outlet temperature, and if it
     gets above 60, we concur that it would be a
     good idea to bring up the secondary loop. Over.

[03:04:43:47]
CMP: Roger.

[03:04:44:17]

LMP: I say how about a little bit of that news you
     promised?

[03:04:50:05]
CC: Roger. We got the Interstellar Times here, the
     December 24 edition. Your TV program was a big
     success. It was viewed this morning by most of
     the nations of your neighboring planet; the earth.
     It was carried live all over Europe, including
     even Moscow and East Berlin, also in Japan and
     all of North and Central America and parts of
     South America. We don't know yet how extensive
     the coverage was in Africa. Are you copying me
     all right? Over.

[03:04:50:38]
CDR: You are loud and clear.

CC: Good. San Diego welcomed home today the Pueblo
     crew in a big ceremony. They had a pretty rough
     time of it in the Korean prison. Christmas
     cease-fire is in effect in Viet Nam, with only
     sporadic outbreaks of fighting. And if you
     haven't done your Christmas shopping by now,
     you better forget it.

[03:04:51:02]

     it's been a mighty long dry spell up here.

CDR: Go, Houston.

[03:04:53:39]
CC: We will get you the number after a while on your
     water dump. It looks like the quantity isn't
     increasing very slightly, and we're considering
     not only the quantity in regard to the dump,
     but also its effects on the trajectory relative
     to TEI and so forth, but we will have a good
     answer for you shortly.

[03:04:54:00]
CDR: We are not just thinking about the waste water
     tank: we're thinking about some other kind of
     water that has to get dumped out of the spacecraft,
     slightly used water.

CC: Roger. We have about three and a half minutes

     are tentatively predicting a waste water tank
     dump at about 80 hours GET and any other dumps
     are at your discretion, any time you would like
     to make them.

[03:05:47:07]
CC: Roger. Read you loud and clear. Welcome back.

[03:05:47:13]
LMP: Roger. Looks like the evaporator - looks like
     the evaporator is holding okay, or at least it
     is trying to. It dropped the temperature down
     to about 32, and now it's come back up again
     and stabilized at about 42 degrees.

[03:05:47:31]
CC: Roger. Copy you, Bill.

[03:05:48:41]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[03:05:48:44]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[03:05:48:50]
CMP: Roger. Houston, this is Apollo 8. What we are
     doing on the control point tracking - I managed
     to look for a CP-1 at the same time we were trying
     to do a CP-2 on this rev. I picked up two
     marks which are just as small, but more easily
     recognizable, than the ones that were given to
     me. I know that I can repeat the process and
     pick the same small point on the next rev. Now
     I can try to look for the control points that
     are written down, but I think that I have better
     control over the ones that we have.

[03:05:49:29]
_page : 8
CC: Roger, Jim. Understand. We'll check that for
     you.

[03:05:49:34]
CMP: Roger. One more point: the control point times
     which you have given me are a little bit off,
     and I can notice by comparing these maps that
     these maps are not too well aligned either.

[03:05:49:47]
CC: Roger. These two small points that you can
     repeat your marks on: will you be able to
     identify those precisely on a map? Over.

[03:05:50:00]
CMP: That's affirmative; that is why I picked them.
     They are both - they're both very prominent
     features, and they are both very small craters
     about the same size as the ones we are looking
     for, but I can pinpoint them on a map.

[03:05:50:13]
CC: Roger.

[03:05:50:48]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[03:05:50:49]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[03:05:50:54]
CMP: Roger. One more comment: as it offered a
     lot of controversy at data priority meetings,
     it looks like 10 degrees pitch up is the best
     attitude to obtain the horizon so that you can
     follow the landmark down through the scanning
     telescope. If you pitch down any more, full
     up trunnion will not get the horizon, and the
     horizon is a great help in leading yourself
     into the control point.

[03:05:51:28]
_page : 9
CC: Roger. Understand.

[03:05:52:40]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[03:05:52:45]
CMP: Go ahead.

[03:05:52:47]
CC: Jim, we concur with your use of the two small
     craters which you can repeatedly mark on and
     find on the map; and also if you will give us
     your new latitudes and longitudes, we can compute
     for you a time of closest approach to those
     points with the spacecraft 10 degrees pitched-up.
     Over.

[03:05:53:12]
CMP: Roger, Houston. CP-1 latitude minus 606269,
     longitude over 2, minus 78954, altitude plus
     00152; for CP-2 latitude minus 09638, longitude
     over 2, plus 81691, altitude minus 00007. I
     tried to get CP-3 at the same pass, but I let
     it go by to get set up for this first track at
     the landing site.

[03:05:54:05]
_page : 10
CC: Roger, Houston. CP-1: would you say again the
     latitude, and on CP-2, say again the longitude
     CP-2, please?

[03:05:54:15]
CMP: Roger. CP-1 latitude minus 06269; that is the
     latitude; and for longitude over 2 for CP-2,
     plus 81691.

[03:05:54:34]
CC: Okay. We copied them. Thank you.

[03:05:54:43]
CMP: And it appears that resolve medium is a very
     good combination to track.

[03:05:54:53]
CC: Roger. I understand. Resolve medium.

[03:05:54:59]
CMP: And it appears so far, Houston, that no spacecraft
     pitch motion is required to get five marks
     on the target in plenty of time.

[03:05:55:10]

     motion to get five marks.

LMP: Roger. Copy. Ready for the TEI.

[03:06:26:26]
CC: Okay, Bill. Before we read the big TEI update
     here, I'd like to give Jim briefly a procedure
     for P22. When he comes to NOUN 89, we request
     that he do a VERB 34 ENTER. Do not proceed, and
     by so doing then, he will not incorporate the
     lat and longitude from his mark, and he will not
     change the reference value of the landing site,
     and we will solve this AUTO OPTICS problem. Over.

[03:06:27:08]
_page : 3
LMP: Let me see if I have this correct, Mike. When
     flashing 0689 comes up with the latitude and
     longitude information, I will not proceed but
     will go to VERB 34 and terminate. Is that correct?

[03:06:27:24]
CC: Yes, that is affirmative. Do a VERB 34 ENTER
     instead of a PROCEED. And that will -

[03:06:27:34]
CMP: Alright. Is this technique true -

[03:06:27:45]
CMP: Houston, is this technique true for both the
     node control point AUTO OPTICS on P25?

[03:06:27:52]
CC: Stand by one, Jim.

[03:06:27:54]
CMP: And the LM ...

[03:06:28:09]
CC: That is affirmative, Apollo 8. That is always
     true.

[03:06:28:16]
CMP: Okay. Roger. True for the code AUTO OPTICS and
     no landmark. I'll proceed instead of going on - 
     or I'll use 34 instead proceeding on 89.

     you do so. The VERB 89 - or correction - the
     NOUN 89 we are talking about is the one that he
     gets after marking. There are two NOUN 89's, one

     noise. Welcome back around. How are you reading us?

[03:07:52:18]

CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.

[03:07:55:51]
CMP: Roger, Houston. A few words on our optics tracking
     system. I used AUTO OPTICS for control points 1 and
     2 on the backside, and they worked beautifully,
     tracked both the targets for me. And I went to the
     control point 3 as designated in our orbital control
     book to see the latitude and longitude that was given
     to me and used AUTO OPTICS to track that particular
     coordinate system, and it was very close to the actual
     tracking plot. I picked the mark there where
     I did a final marking and recorded latitude and longitude.
     I'm now about to come up on the landing site
     and using AUTO OPTICS in the coded input to see how
     that works.

LMP: Go ahead.

[03:07:59:35]
CC: Roger. We know you're busy so we are not going
     to bother you. We are watching your progress
     on the DSKY. You are looking good; all your
     systems are looking good, and we have maneuver
     PAD's for you any time at your convenience.

[03:07:59:52]
LMP: Roger. We will take them when we are doing the
     P52, if that's okay.

[03:07:59:56]
CC: That is just fine.
     03 08 56 CMP Mike, Apollo 8.

[03:08:07:58]
CC: Apollo 8, go ahead.

[03:08:08:03]
CMP: Mike, there are an awful lot of objects down on
     the landing site. It would just warm up Jack
     Schmidt's heart. The AUTO OPTICS are tracking
     perfectly on the target, and the two high peaks
     stand out beautifully. I have a beautiful view
     of it. The first I've seen just barely beneath
     the vertical now, and the second one coming up -
     It's just a grand view!

[03:08:08:28]
CC: Roger, Jim. Glad to hear it. Jack's listening.

[03:08:09:45]
LMP: Jack, the information - The triangles that we see
     now are from the first IP, second IP, and the B-1
     are just right, I think, for landing conditions.
     The shadows aren't too deep for you to get confused.
     but the land has texture to it, and there are
     enough shadows there to make everything stand out.

[03:08:10:01]
_page : 3
LMP: If Jack's listening, tell him that the optical may
     be doing all right, but the eyeball is having a
     little trouble looking through all this smear on
     the windows.

[03:08:10:25]
CC: Roger. Understand the optics are doing better than
     the eyeballs. How about the cameras?

[03:08:10:33]
LMP: We always have the same smear to look through. The
     rendezvous windows are okay, but they're so small
     and looking in the wrong directions here so far.

[03:08:10:42]
CC: Roger.

[03:08:10:43]
LMP: I think the vertical stereo will be okay.

[03:08:11:10]
LMP: It certainly looks like we're picking the more interesting
     places on the moon to land in. The backside
     looks like a sand pile my kids have been
     playing in for a long time. It's all beat up, no
     definition. Just a lot of bumps and holes.

[03:08:11:27]
CMP: I'm looking at 2P-2 right now, Houston, and it's
     a great spot.

[03:08:11:33]
LMP: The area we're over right now gives some hint of
     possible volcanic, though I really can't eyeball
     it at the moment to pin that down. There are some
     craters and buildups that just definitely suggest
     volcanic activity.

[03:08:11:52]
CC: Roger. Understand, Bill, and understand Jim thinks
     the old 2P-2 is a winner.

[03:08:12:06]
_page : 4
LMP: Yes, that backside doesn't look good at all.

[03:08:12:10]
CC: Roger.

[03:08:12:15]
LMP: That's relatively speaking, of course.

[03:08:12:18]
CC: Of course.

[03:08:18:52]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[03:08:18:53]
CMP: This is Apollo 8.

[03:08:18:56]
CC: Roger, Jim. We have you on the high-gain antenna.
     We'd like you to take the DSE and dump it over.

[03:08:19:05]
CMP: Roger, Houston. Are you going to use our computer
     to update our state vector?

[03:08:19:34]
CC: That's affirmative, Jim. We'd like to - stand by
     one, and I'll tell you when to go to P00 and ACCEPT.

[03:08:19:45]
CMP: Roger. Then I'll work my 52 around your ...

[03:08:20:05]
CC: Jim, would you please go to P00 in ACCEPT, and
     we'll send you a P27 and run a state vector update.

[03:08:20:12]
CMP: Roger. You have P00 in ACCEPT.

[03:08:20:16]
CC: Thank you.

[03:08:20:36]
CMP: Houston, this is Apollo 8. We have a little piece
     of useful information if you're interested in deliberating over it.

[03:08:20:46]
CC: Go ahead. Say again.

[03:08:20:51]
CMP: Roger. Our first control point is very near the
     terminator, and as the optics were tracking it, I
     had occasion to watch the sun come up. And at
     about 2 minutes before sunrise, you get - the limb
     begins to brighten up into sort of a fine white
     haze, a fine glow completely over
     the space just behind the limb.

[03:08:21:23]
_page : 5
CC: Roger. I understand. About 2 minutes before the
     sun comes up, you get a fine white haze radiating
     out from behind the limb. How far out does it extend?

[03:08:21:34]
CMP: It goes up quite a ways. It takes a fan shape,
     unlike the sunrise on earth where the atmosphere
     affects it. This just sort of is a complete haze
     all over the local area. It's concentrated at the
     exact spot where the sun comes up at ignition and
     then goes away from the sun spots. Very interesting.

[03:08:21:54]
CC: Thank you, Jim. Thank you.

[03:08:22:36]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We're standing by with your map
     and TEI 7 updates.

[03:08:22:48]
CMP: Stand by.

[03:08:22:54]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. You can go back to BLOCK with
     your computer.

[03:08:23:02]
CMP: Roger.

[03:08:23:31]
LMP: Okay, Mike. We're ready for the map update and
     then the TEI.

[03:08:23:38]
CC: Okay. When you get your - before you get your map
     book out, the Houston COMM TECHS have got a little
     word for an old ex-CAP COMM. They say they consider
     you in NONREMOTE. Over.

[03:08:23:54]
LMP: Not permanently, I hope.

[03:08:23:59]
_page : 6
CC: Okay. Your map update for REV 6/7: LOS 80:57:24,
     sunrise 81:06:57, prime meridian 81:13:02. Are
     you with me?

[03:08:24:29]
LMP: You cut out after the prime meridian. I got it,
     but not AOS.

[03:08:24:33]
CC: AOS 81:43:05, sunset 82:13:54. Remarks: IP-1
     TCA for B-1 82:07:39, and now I've got four more
     times for you which - acquisition times for when
     various things come over the horizon. Over.
     03 08 25-09 LMP Roger. Go ahead.

[03:08:25:12]
CC: Okay. Control point 1, acquisition time 81:09:05;
     control point 2, acquisition time 81:21:48; control
     point 3, acquisition time 81:43:17. B-1 acquisition
     time 82:03:54. And I say again all those ACQ times
     are when they first come over the horizon. Over.

[03:08:25:54]
LMP: Roger. Copy, Houston. In about 2 seconds, I'll
     be ready for the TEI.

[03:08:26:01]
CC: Alright.

[03:08:26:13]
LMP: I'm ready.

[03:08:26:16]
CC: TEI 7, SPS/G&N - stand by one, Bill.

[03:08:26:55]
LMP: Just a matter of general interest, Houston: everybody
     is feeling good, and the CDR is taking a
     snooze.

[03:08:27:01]
CC: Roger. Glad to hear it. We were just talking about
     a water dump down here. We've got one coming up,
     and it looks like on this REV prior to the time
     around LOS or just prior to LOS, would be a convenient
     time to do it. Do you concur?

[03:08:27:20]
_page : 7
LMP: Okay. We will. Down to 25 percent again?

[03:08:27:24]
CC: That's affirmative, and we'd also be interested
     in any comments about what these various dumps
     have done to your optics, if anything, and how
     long the effects last after a dump.

[03:08:27:38]
LMP: Don't seem to have done anything to the optics,
     but they've definitely got in some of the windows.
     There are a few little chunks of ice
     on window number 1, which is nearest the vent,
     and also on window number 5 a little bit; windows
     2 and 4 remain amazingly clear.

[03:08:28:11]
CC: Roger. Thank you, Bill, and I'm ready to resume
     the PAD when you are.

[03:08:28:19]
LMP: Okay. Press on with the weight.

[03:08:28:22]

CC: Roger. I got down through DELTA-V, minus X,
     minus Y, and minus Z. Did you copy those? Over.

[03:08:29:44]
LMP: No, I didn't read a word. I'm still waiting for
     the weight.

[03:08:29:49]

[03:08:41:33]
CC: And also, Jim, we are - That last P27 we sent

[03:08:53:19]
CC: I'll find out for you.

[03:08:53:26]
LMP: If you can wake up the EECOM, why don't you
     have him ask the back room?

[03:08:55:59]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. One minute til LOS, and
     standing by.

[03:09:46:59]
CC: Roger. We have a request that Jim space his
     marks, his five marks out a bit more slowly.
     If possible, we would like to get a couple of
     them past the zenith. We're getting five of
     them with rather rapid spacing, and from the
     geometry viewpoint, it would be better if you'd
     slow them down a little bit and lengthened them
     out so as to include a couple of them past the
     zenith. Over.

[03:09:47:29]
CDR: Roger. We understand.

[03:09:47:39]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8. That last set of marks
     are invalid. Disregard what Jim drew the last

     invalid. Over.

     Could you say again, please?

[03:09:48:12]
CMP: Roger. I'm coming up on control point 3. I
     tried to stick another control point in between
     2 and 3. It didn't do it, so I just took out
     our program, marked it down on the program.

[03:09:48:25]

CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[03:09:52:07]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[03:09:52:09]
CC: Roger. On Jim's marks, we'd like to get spacing
     of approximately 30, 30 seconds between each
     mark. The last ones we are copying roughly
     15 seconds between marks, and we would like to
     stretch it out even further if that is okay with
     you.

CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[03:10:02:27]
CMP: Roger, Mike. I find that tracking is much easier
     using the sextant than the scanning telescope.
     You have finer control, and at these orbital
     speeds, resolved to medium seem to be the best
     combination.

[03:10:02:46]
_page : 3
CC: Roger, Jim. I copy that it's easier for you to
     use the sextant than the scanning telescope. It
     gives you finer control, and say again after that.

[03:10:03:05]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Do you read?

[03:10:03:09]
CMP: Roger. Did you copy?

[03:10:03:12]
CC: Roger. I copy that it's - tracking is easier
     using the sextant than the scanning telescope;
     it gives you finer control, and say again after
     that. Over.

[03:10:03:26]
CMP: And the combination of resolved and medium is
     perhaps the best combination of - combination
     of - speed low is too low; we can't catch up with
     the target.

[03:10:03:39]
CC: Roger. Understand that the best combination is
     resolved and medium. Low is just too low.

     the code, and I kept getting a large trunnion
     for AUTO OPTICS. And I could see the target, or
     landing site was coming up, so I just went manually
     and marked and got the - the latitude and longitude
     were quite different from the nominal.

     restart in the computer and wondered if you had
     any remarks about it. Over.

[03:10:27:00]

     programs. He's getting kind of tired here, and
     we got a RESTART and a couple of PROGRAM ALARMS.
     I don't know what he did.

[03:10:27:12]

     is looking fine to us, now.

[03:10:28:39]
CC: Roger. In some of Jim's previous comments about
     the limb brightness as the sun was about to come
     up has sparked a lot of interest down here. And
     we'd like to ask him if he gets a chance to notice
     again or perhaps he can recall, whether there were any
     changes in the appearance of the stars. Such as,
     did he notice any twinkling while this was taking
     place, and did he notice any narrow limb brightening
     within 10 to 20 seconds prior to the sun's rising?
     Over.

[03:10:29:14]
LMP: He'll be with you - he's doing a P52 now.

[03:10:29:17]
CC: Okay.

[03:10:30:08]
CMP: Houston, my comments concerning the sunrise was
     the comments above the terrain. There appeared
     what might be called diagonal light or light due
     to the haze or something like that. As the sun
     came above or before the sun came above the limb,
     definite rays could be seen coming from the other
     side. It was a uniform haze emanating from the
     center spot where the sun was going to rise, and
     this was something which I didn't expect.

[03:10:30:42]
CC: Roger, Jim. Understand. We copied that and just
     curious, and if you see it again whether you notice
     any stars twinkling or any additional information.

[03:10:30:55]
_page : 8
CMP: Will do. Won't have a chance until control point 1.

[03:10:31:06]
LMP: Actually, he doesn't want to pass out too much of
     that information. He wants to save it and write
     a paper when he gets back, Mike.

[03:10:31:12]

[03:10:36:08]
CC: 85:37 to terminator, which is probably like 86:14.

[03:10:36:20]
CDR: okay. Well, I don't know if we can go that long
     with it, and I'm going to scrub all the other
     experiments, the converging stereo or other
     photography, and we are a little bit tired; I
     want to use that last bit to really make sure we're
     right for TEI.

[03:10:36:38]
CC: Roger, I understand, Frank.

[03:10:36:42]
CC: A couple of miscellaneous items for you: we'd
     like for you to discontinue charging battery B at
     this time; we'd also like to get a cryo stir,
     2 minutes on all four; and your UP TELEMETRY IU
     switch, put to BLOCK, please, and you are GO for
     the next lunar orbit.

[03:10:40:30]

     2, and 3 on the next REV and the converging
     stereo on the following REV.

[03:10:40:42]

[03:10:41:44]
CC: This REV coming up we would like to clarify
     whether you intend to scrub control points 1, 2,
     and 3, only, and do the pseudo landing site; or
     whether you also intend to scrub the pseudo landing
     site marks. Over.

[03:10:42:01]
CDR: We're scrubbing everything. I'll stay up and try
     and keep the spacecraft vertical and take some
     automatic pictures, but I want Jim and Bill to
     get some rest.

     The platform looks good, and it appears
     that it is your option if you would like to

     window line at T minus 3; use high speed procedure
     with minus Mike Alfa. After looking at
     the burn information from your previous SPS
     burns, it appears that the engine performance
     should give us a 3-second burn time, longer
     than what you have on the PAD. The PAD number
     should correspond with what you get out of the
     computer. So we have not factored this into
     the past data; however, you can anticipate the
     engine for a normal DELTA-V to give you a
     3 second - 3.7-second burn in excess of the
     computed times. Over.

[03:12:15:54]
CC: Okay. It looks to us like, although we're
     reading out the same thing you are on the quad
     quantity, using the computer program and all of
     the correction factors that are in there, it
     looks like all four of your quads are very close.
     In pounds, it looks like you have, for example,
     193 pounds in quad A and 189 in B, 200 in C,
     and 190 in Delta. And the difference that you
     read on the gage is attributed to the fact that
     you don't have all of the correction factors in
     there. This ground calculation has an accuracy
     of about plus or minus 6 percent, and the best
     you can do on board, even using your chart, is
     plus or minus 10 percent. Over.

     they're predicting where you're going.

     In the event that the situation develops again,
     for pointing accuracies, if I see anything that
     looks like a terminator or anything of that nature,
     I'm going to call the dark side of it 12 o'clock,
     and use that as a reference system, and we'll try
     that. If that doesn't dope out any problems with
     camera pointing, why I may try - call for a plus
     pitch, and then I'll just correct what I see to
     account for it.

[03:12:45:16]

     I don't believe we'll be able to get a picture of

     now; and we won't see it again during that period.

     screen, but the moon is nothing but a milky white -
     completely void. We're changing the cameras to the
     other window now.

[03:13:44:58]
CDR: This is Apollo 8, coming to you live from the moon.
     We've had to switch the TV cameras now. We showed
     you first a view of earth as we've been watching it
     for the past 16 hours. Now we're switching so that
     we can show you the moon that we've been flying
     over at 60 miles altitude for the last 16 hours.
     Bill Anders, Jim Lovell, and myself have spent the
     day before Christmas up here doing experiments,
     taking pictures, and firing our spacecraft engines
     to maneuver around. What we will do now is follow
     the trail that we've been following all day and
     take you on through to a lunar sunset. The moon
     is a different thing to each one of us. I think
     that each one of us - each one carries his own impression
     of what he's seen today. I know my own
     impression is that it's a vast, lonely, forbidding-type
     existence, or expanse of nothing, that looks
     rather like clouds and clouds of pumice stone, and
     it certainly would not appear to be a very inviting
     place to live or work. Jim, what have you thought
     most about?

[03:13:46:23]
_page : 6
CMP: Well, Frank, my thoughts are very similar. The
     vast loneliness up here of the moon is awe inspiring,
     and it makes you realize just what you
     have back there on earth. The earth from here
     is a grand oasis in the big vastness of space.

[03:13:46:41]
CDR: Bill, what do you think?

[03:13:46:44]
LMP: I think the thing that impressed me the most was
     the lunar sunrises and sunsets. These in particular
     bring out the stark nature of the terrain,
     and the long shadows really bring out the relief
     that is here and hard to see at this very bright
     surface that we're going over right now.

[03:13:47:05]
CDR: You're describe - that's not color, Bill. Describe
     some of the physical features of what
     you're showing the people.

[03:13:47:17]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We're not receiving a picture
     now. Over.

[03:13:47:24]
LMP: We're now coming on to Smyth's Sea, a small mare
     region covered with a dark, level material. There
     is a fresh, bright, impact crater on the edge
     towards us and a mountain range on the other side.
     These mountains are the Pyrenees.

[03:13:47:48]
CC: Apollo 8, we're not receiving modulation on the
     signal; we do have SYNC.

[03:13:47:58]
CDR: Are you reading us? Apollo, Houston.

[03:13:48:02]
_page : 7
CC: Apollo 8, we're reading you loud and clear, but
     no picture. We have no modulation.

[03:13:48:07]
CMP: Roger. We understand. Take a look now.

[03:13:48:09]
LMP: How about now? Apollo.

[03:13:48:12]
CC: Loud and clear. Good picture.

[03:13:48:28]
LMP: What you're seeing has been cross - Smyth's Sea
     are the craters Castner and Gilbert, and what
     we've noticed especially, that you cannot see
     from the earth, are the small bright impact
     craters that dominate the lunar surface.

[03:13:49:03]
LMP: The horizon here is very, very stark. The sky
     is pitch black, and the earth - or the moon,
     rather, excuse me - is quite light; and the contrast
     between the sky and the moon is a vivid,
     dark line. Coming into the view of the camera
     now are some interesting old double ring craters,
     some interesting features that are quite common
     in the mare region and have been filled by some
     material the same consistency of the maria and
     the same color. Here are three or four of these
     interesting features. Further on the horizon you
     see the ... The mountains coming up now are heavily
     impacted with numerous craters whose central
     peaks you can see in many of the larger ones.

[03:13:50:08]
CMP: Actually, I think the best way to describe this
     area is a vastness of black and white, absolutely
     no color.

[03:13:50:22]
_page : 8
LMP: The sky up here is also rather forbidding, foreboding
     expanse of blackness, with no stars visible
     when we're flying over the moon in daylight.

[03:13:50:52]
LMP: You can see by the numerous craters that this
     planet has been bombarded through the eons with
     numerous small asteroids and meteoroids pockmarking
     the surface every square inch.

[03:13:51:11]
CMP: And one of the amazing features of the surface
     is the roundness that most of the craters - seems
     that most of them have a round mound type of appearance
     instead of sharp, jagged rocks.

[03:13:51:23]
LMP: Only the newest feature is of any sharp definition
     to them, and eventually they get eroded down by
     the constant bombardment of small meteorites.

[03:13:51:45]
LMP: How is the picture now, Houston? Houston, are
     you reading us?

[03:13:51:54]
CC: Loud and clear, and the picture looks real fine.

[03:13:52:00]
LMP: Thank you.

[03:13:52:04]
LMP: Can you see the two large craters just to the
     right of our track, Houston?

[03:13:52:15]
CC: That's affirmative.

[03:13:52:51]
LMP: The very bright features you see are the new impact
     craters, and the longer a crater has been
     on the surface of the moon, why, the more mottled
     and subdued it becomes. Some of the - -

[03:13:53:25]
CC: Apollo 8, we've apparently lost your voice; the
     picture is still good.

[03:13:53:32]
_page : 9
LMP: Roger.

[03:13:53:37]
CMP: Houston, we're passing over an area that's just
     east of the Smyth's Sea now, in checking our
     charts. Smyth's Sea is coming up in a few minutes.

[03:13:53:51]
CC: Roger.

[03:13:54:12]
CC: Apollo 8, if you go to P00 and ACCEPT, we'll uplink
     some information.

[03:13:54:43]
LMP: We are now coming up towards the terminator, and
     I hope soon that we'll be able to show you the
     varying contrast of white as we go into the darkness.
     Houston, we're in P00, and you have the
     computer.

[03:13:54:58]
CC: Thank you.

[03:13:55:16]
LMP: We're now approaching a series of small impact
     craters. There is a dark area between us and
     them which could possibly be an old lava flow.

[03:13:55:58]
LMP: You can see the large mountains on the horizon
     now ahead of the spacecraft to the north of our
     track.

[03:13:56:25]
LMP: The intensity of the sun's reflection in this
     area makes it difficult for us to distinguish
     the features we see on the surface, and I suppose
     it's even harder on the television, but as we approach
     the terminator and the shadows become longer,
     you'll see a marked change.

[03:13:57:00]
_page : 10
LMP: There is a very dark crater in the filling material
     in this valley in front of us now. It is rather
     unusual in that it is sharply defined, yet it's
     dark all over its interior walls, whereas most
     new-looking craters are of very bright interior.

[03:13:57:38]
LMP: Small impact crater in front of us now in the little
     mare well defined, quite new, and another one
     approaching. The spacecraft is facing North.
     From our track, we are going sideways to our left.

[03:13:58:11]
LMP: You are now seeing the Sea of Crises coming over
     the horizon.
     END OF TAPE

[03:13:58:37]
_page : 1
_tape : Tape 58
LMP: We believe the crater, the large dark crater
     between the spacecraft and the Sea of Crises
     is Condorcet Crater. The Sea of Crises is
     amazingly smooth as far as the horizon and
     past this rather rough mountainous region in
     front of the spacecraft.

[03:13:59:10]
CC: Apollo 8, we are through with the computer.
     You can go back to BLOCK, and it looks like
     we are getting a lot of reflection off your
     window now.

[03:13:59:25]
LMP: Roger. We'll switch windows; How does that
     look now, Ken?

[03:13:59:41]
CC: That's real fine.

[03:14:00:26]
CC: Apollo 8, can you tell us which window you
     are looking out? And there is a large crater,
     looks like it is sticking up in the upper right
     hand corner of our picture. Can you identify
     that one?

[03:14:00:43]
LMP: Roger. We are just about to lose our lock; that
     is why we are slowing up a little bit. We see
     the Sea of Crises in front of us now. We are
     looking out the left hand rendezvous window.

[03:14:01:28]
LMP: Houston, how are you reading us now?

[03:14:01:30]
CC: Loud and clear.

[03:14:01:34]
LMP: The crater you see on the horizon is the Sea of
     Crises. How are you reading us, Houston?

[03:14:01:47]
_page : 2
CC: Loud and clear, Apollo 8, and we have a picture
     that is good.

[03:14:01:51]
LMP: Right.

[03:14:01:53]
LMP: Roger. We are getting a lot of static. The
     Sea of Crises is in front of us on the horizon,
     and the dark crater Picard can be seen in the
     middle. We are now breaking the moon's sunrise
     or the spacecraft's sunset. This is an area that
     the sun has just recently come up on the moon.
     The mare we are over now has a mottled look about
     it, but not very heavily cratered, so it must be
     relatively new. This is the Sea of Fertility,
     and we're coming upon a large crater, the delta
     rim variety; has a strange circular cracked
     pattern around the middle of it. The crater that
     you see now is about 30 or 40 miles across.

[03:14:03:51]
LMP: How is your picture quality, Houston?

[03:14:03:55]
CC: This is phenomenal.

[03:14:04:00]
LMP: There is an interesting rill directly in front of
     the spacecraft now, running along the edge of
     a small mountain; rather sinuous shape with right-angle
     turns.

[03:14:04:30]
LMP: This area just to the west of the Sea of Crises is
     called the Marsh of Sleep and to the west of that
     the Sea of Tranquility.

[03:14:04:40]
LMP: Can you see the fracture patterns going across the
     mare in front of us now, Houston?

[03:14:04:47]
_page : 3
CC: That doesn't quite stand out.

[03:14:04:53]
LMP: Roger. The series of cracks or faults across
     the middle of the mare: they drop down in about
     three steps to the south. The parallel fault
     pattern to the north has a drop down in the
     center. I hope all of you back down on earth
     can see what we mean when we say that it is
     a rather foreboding horizon, a very rather dark
     and unappetizing looking place. We are now going
     over - approaching one of our future landing
     sites selected in this smooth region to - called
     the Sea of Tranquility - smooth in order to make
     it easy for the initial landing attempts in order
     to preclude the having to dodge mountains. Now
     you can see the long shadows of the lunar sunrise.
     We are now approaching the lunar sunrise, and for
     all the people back on earth, the crew of Apollo 8
     has a message that we would like to send to you.

[03:14:06:56]
LMP: In the beginning, God created the Heaven and the
     Earth.  And the Earth was without form and void,
     and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And
     the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters,
     and God said, "let there be light." And there was
     light. And God saw the light and that it was good,
     and God divided the light from the darkness.

[03:14:07:29]
CMP: And God called the light Day, and the darkness he
     called Night. And the evening and the morning
     were the first day.  And God said, "let there be
     a firmament in the midst of the waters. And let
     it divide the waters from the waters."  And God
     made the firmament and divided the waters which
     were under the firmament from the waters which
     were above the firmament. And it was so. And
     God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening
     and the morning were the second day.

[03:14:08:07]
_page : 4
CDR: And God said, "let the waters under the Heavens
     be gathered together into one place. And let
     the dry land appear." And it was so. And God
     called the dry land Earth. And the gathering
     together of the waters called the seas. And
     God saw that it was good. And from the crew of
     Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck,
     a Merry Christmas and God bless all of you - all
     of you on the good Earth.

[03:14:09:46]
CDR: Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.

[03:14:09:48]
CC: Loud and clear, Apollo 8. And thank you for
     a very good show. We have a maneuver PAD for
     you when you are ready to copy.

[03:14:10:00]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[03:14:10:02]
CC: Apollo 8, read you loud and clear.

[03:14:10:07]
CDR: Roger. Are we off the air now?

[03:14:10:21]
CC: That's affirmative, Apollo 8. You are.

[03:14:10:26]
CDR: Did you read everything that we had to say there?

[03:14:10:29]
_page : 5
CC: Loud and clear. Thank you for a real
     good show.

[03:14:10:34]
CDR: Okay. Now, Ken, we'd like to get all squared
     away for TEI here. Can you give us some good
     words like you promised?

[03:14:10:41]
CC: Yes, sir. I have a maneuver PAD. I think we
     would like to start by dumping the tape. If
     we can have that, I have your TEI 10 maneuver
     PAD, and then we will run through a systems
     brief.

[03:14:10:59]
CDR: I understand this is a maneuver PAD that we
     will use for TEI. Is that correct?

[03:14:11:11]
LMP: And you got the tape, Houston.

[03:14:11:13]
CC: Thank you.

[03:14:11:18]

     minus 040, plus 157 089:19:15.64, plus 35189,
     minus 01513, minus 00346 180 007 000, not

[03:14:16:09]
CC: That's correct, Apollo 8.

[03:14:16:17]
CDR: Ken, this is Frank. I want to - - I want to
     make one thing certain. This the load that
     we are to use to burn with, right? This is
     not just a PAD data for 10 abort?

[03:14:16:32]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. We will update this PAD prior
     to the burn.

[03:14:16:40]
CDR: Oh, you will? Okay.

[03:14:16:42]
CC: Yes, sir.

[03:14:16:46]
CDR: Say again.

[03:14:19:39]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[03:14:19:44]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[03:14:19:46]
CC: Roger. I am reading you with a lot of background
     noise. Can you read me clearly?

[03:14:19:54]
CDR: Roger.

[03:14:19:55]
CC: Okay. I am going to give you a quick summary
     of systems. Basically, all systems are good. In
     respect to your return trajectory, we can still
     get to the mid-Pacific line at 146 hours by
     waiting as late as the thirteenth REV. After
     138 seconds of the burn, you are on your way
     home. The weather in the recovery area looks
     good. Apollo 8, did you call?

[03:14:20:43]
_page : 7
CDR: Continue, Houston.

[03:14:21:05]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Could we have the high gain
     for a little bit longer?

[03:14:21:12]
CDR: We broke scan on it, Ken.

[03:14:21:15]
CC: Okay. You are coming in loud and clear now.
     Did you copy my trajectory information?

[03:14:21:20]
CDR: We are on OMNI B now.

[03:14:21:23]
CC: Roger. That is fine.

[03:14:21:24]
CDR: Say again, please. Go ahead. We are 130 -
     Will you say again, please?

[03:14:21:29]
CC: Wilco, Apollo 8. First, if you can spare, we
     would like to have the high gain to complete
     the dump.

[03:14:21:54]
CDR: Stand by. We will try to get it for you.

[03:14:21:56]
CC: Roger.

[03:14:22:17]
CDR: In a couple of minutes there, Houston.

[03:14:22:19]
CC: Roger. Thank you.

[03:14:22:47]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. While we are - -

[03:14:22:57]
CC: Apollo 8, while we are waiting for the high gain,
     I will continue the trajectory summary. We can
     still get back to the mid-Pacific line in 146 hours
     from the thirteenth REV, and you are on your way
     after 138 seconds of the burn. That's 138 seconds,
     gets you clear of the butterfly region. We
     recommend not trying preignitions or restarts after
     20 seconds. If you go beyond 20 seconds, this may
     get the trajectory beyond the correction - RCS correction
     capability to a free return. The weather
     in recovery area is good. We have an AOS following
     TEI of 89 plus 28 plus 39 and an AOS without
     TEI of 89 plus 37 plus 24. During the burn, you
     may notice a slight change in chamber pressure and
     tank pressures due to the fuel exhaustion in the
     storage tank and going to the sump tank. This may
     occur somewhere around 2 to 5 seconds into the
     burn. It'll be a small change in pressures in both
     systems. Going down the systems, all systems are
     GO. In ECS, we want to stop water boiling after
     TEI for trajectory purposes. Your water dump
     situation looks good; you should be good to greater
     than 105 hours. We'll try to hold off the water
     dump until after MCC 5. In the EPS, we'd like to
     stir the cryos prior to TLI - correction TEI. The
     next purge on the fuel cells will occur at approximately
     92 hours, and that will be both hydrogen
     and oxygen. Your battery status: battery A 34.9,
     battery B 39.1, and Charlie 38.5. We have the
     single tank cryo capability. SPS: looking at
     the performance on the previous burns, you can
     anticipate a normal burn taking approximately
     3.7 seconds in excess of the computed values.
     Engine performance looks nominal, and all parameters
     have been steady. RCS looks good; all
     four quads according to the computer programs
     have approximately the same capacity. You have
     a good REFSMMAT to take you through TEI. We'll
     have a post TEI PTC attitude for you in a few
     minutes. and that just about wraps up what we
     have on systems. Over.

[03:14:26:43]
_page : 9
CDR: Roger. Thank you, Houston. We appreciate the
     summary. We're trying to get high gain.

[03:14:26:49]
CC: Roger,

[03:14:26:53]
CMP: I think we have it.

[03:14:26:54]
CDR: You do have the high gain. Now, Ken, as I
     understand it, if it shuts down after 20 seconds of burn, you
     don't want us to try to re-light it. Is that what you said?

[03:14:27:04]
CC: Stand by.

[03:14:27:12]
CC: Apollo 8, the intent was do not delay ignitions
     beyond 20 seconds. Over.

[03:14:27:21]
CDR: Oh, do not delay ignition beyond 20 seconds
     Roger.

[03:14:27:24]
CC: That's affirm.

[03:14:27:27]
_page : 10
CDR: Okay. You want me to start it on tank A and
     then switch to B again like we did on our LOI,
     right?

[03:14:27:39]
CC: That's affirmative.

[03:14:27:43]
CDR: Okay.

[03:14:27:47]
CDR: Did you put in this PAD for us? Should P30 and
     40 be in our computer now?

[03:14:28:19]
CC: Apollo 8, that's negative. We had not uplinked
     this PAD. We'll put this one in on the next pass.

[03:14:28:26]
CDR: Okay. Roger.

[03:14:33:28]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. You have a GO for this REV.

[03:14:33:34]
CMP: Roger, Houston.

[03:14:38:29]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We have completed the tape
     dump, and the recorder is yours.

[03:14:38:35]
CDR: Thank you.

[03:14:43:03]
LMP: Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8 on OMNI C.

     for you in a little bit.

     recorded on low bit rate, and looking over our
     tape dumps, most of this stuff we have on the
     backside there is low bit rate. So we won't
     be able to give you an exact number, but looking
     at what we have every time we go out of
     sight and come back over the hill, it looks
     like you can expect about 82 to 84 degrees as
     a nominal temperature.

[03:16:15:22]

     here that originated at the Cape with a bunch of

     of a poem that you probably are familiar with. Do
     you read me, Apollo 8?

[03:17:59:50]
CDR: You are loud and clear, Jack.

[03:17:59:53]
_page : 6
CC: Okay. "'Twas the night before Christmas and way
     out in space, the Apollo 8 crew had just won the
     moon race. The headsets were hung by the consoles
     with care in hopes that Chris Kraft soon would be
     there. Frank Borman was nestled all snug in his
     bed, while visions of REFSMMAT's danced in his
     head; and Jim Lovell, in his couch, and Anders,
     in the bay, were racking their brains over a computer
     display. When out of the DSKY, there arose
     such a clatter, Frank sprang from his bed to see
     what was the matter. Away to the sextant he flew
     like a flash to make sure they weren't going to
     crash. The light on the breast of the moon's
     jagged crust gave a luster of green cheese to the
     gray lunar dust. When what to his wondering eyes
     should appear, but a Burma Shave sign saying 'Kilroy
     was here.' (Laughter) But Frank was no fool; he
     knew pretty quick that they had been first; this
     must be a trick. More rapid than rockets, his
     curses they came. He turned to his crewmen and
     called them a name. Now Lovell, now Anders, now
     don't think I'd fall for an old joke you've written
     up on the wall. They spoke not a word, but grinning
     like elves, and laughed at their joke in spite of
     themselves. Frank sprang to his couch, to the
     ship gave a thrust, and away they all flew past
     the gray lunar dust. But we heard them explain
     ere they flew around the moon: Merry Christmas
     to earth; we will be back there real soon."
     Great job, gang.

     now. What's on the program here? You want us in
     P23 and then what?

[03:18:07:40]
CC: Looks like some sleep is coming up.

[03:18:07:46]
CDR: That's what I wanted you to say. We used up
     the gimbal angles of 10 and 45 with the - this
     REFSMMAT, right?

[03:18:07:54]
CC: Affirmative.

[03:18:07:58]
CDR: Okay.

[03:18:13:56]
_page : 8
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[03:18:14:00]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[03:18:14:03]
CC: Roger. Notice that you are starting on your P23
     which is the last scheduled activity. Initial
     tracking looks like the initial midcourse may be
     less than the 4 foot per second on the first guess.
     And we have looked at your burn data, and it's
     all just as smooth as you said; everything on
     there looked real nominal. Systems now look good;
     looks like in PTC attitude, we should be able to
     switch OMNI's for you, if you would like to do that.
     We were having good success with predicting on the
     way out where to switch the antennas, and if it
     will help you any, we can do that on the way back
     in.

[03:18:14:48]
CDR: That would be nice if you could do it, but we will
     keep one man in the shop to watch the gimbal angles;
     but if you could switch the OMNI's, it would sure
     save us a lot of problems.

[03:18:14:58]
CC: Okay. We will do that. When you get in the PTC
     attitude, we will let you know when we take the
     command on the antenna switching.

[03:18:15:10]
CDR: Okay. Just be careful what you do with the tape
     recorder. Bill's a little sensitive about that.

[03:18:15:25]
CC: Roger. We were listening to the tape dumps, and
     it looks like Bill gets a happy new year after all.

[03:18:15:35]
_page : 9
CDR: A happy new year? How come, Jack - an, in a
     joke?

[03:18:15:40]
CC: No, we got that off of his tape dump; he and Jim
     were discussing that one.

[03:18:15:48]
CDR: Oh, yes. That's right.

[03:18:35:16]
CDR: Houston, are you getting all this data from P23?

[03:18:35:39]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[03:18:35:40]
CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8.

[03:18:35:44]
CDR: I wanted to know if you're getting the data from
     P23?

[03:18:35:47]
CC: That's affirmative.

[03:18:35:51]
CDR: Okay.

CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8.

[03:19:10:22]
CDR: Ken, we've about run out of gas here on this
     next set of stars. Would you ask your people
     to be especially alert there watching the
     systems tonight?

[03:19:10:31]
CC: Sure will, Frank.

[03:19:10:36]
CDR: Okay. It's maneuver to pitch 10 and yaw 45.

[03:19:10:41]
CC: Roger. I have - let's see, we've got a hydrogen
     purge line here that ought to come on about
     91:40 and an oxygen-hydrogen fuel cell purge
     for 92 hours.

[03:19:10:59]
CDR: Okay. Will you call us about those, please?

[03:19:11:02]
CC: I sure will. And, let's see, we just wanted
     to let you know we've got a real good battery
     charge going here this time. Looks like - it
     looks just like the ones in the back, and I'd
     like to get a battery C voltage before you shut
     down, and a sleep report on what you did in - -

[03:19:11:22]
CDR: Okay.

[03:19:11:23]
CC: - - lunar orbit and your plans for the next
     couple of hours.

[03:19:11:29]
CDR: Okay.

[03:19:11:47]
CDR: Thirty-seven volts on battery C.

[03:19:11:50]
_page : 2
CC: Roger. Thirty-seven volts.

[03:19:11:52]
CDR: That looks good.

[03:19:11:59]
CDR: We all only got about 2 hours sleep today MAX,
     Ken. We're going now - Bill's going to stay up
     awhile, and Jim and I are going to sack out,
     and we're going to try to rotate short sleep
     cycles till we can get back to the normal one.

[03:19:12:12]
CC: Roger, sounds like a good idea. And EECOM
     on the ground tells us that the flying EECOM is to go
     ahead and put his hydrogen purge line heater
     on, and we'll get ready for a fuel cell.

[03:19:12:27]
CDR: Thank you. He can't turn on his radio. There
     he goes.

[03:19:12:44]
CDR: I hope it won't disappoint anybody too much
     if we knock off those last two stars, but Jim
     is just in a daze, and so am I.

[03:19:12:50]
CC: Roger. No sweat.

[03:19:12:55]
CDR: Thank you.

[03:19:13:19]
CC: Apollo 8. One of the things we'd like to have
     before you shut down also is VERB 64 so we can
     watch the pointing angles.

[03:19:13:30]
CDR: Roger.

[03:19:13:35]
CC: Hey, Frank, you might be interested; they are
     having some trouble with the medics' P-2.

[03:19:13:45]
CDR: What?

[03:19:13:48]
LMP: The medics can't clean out their P-2.

[03:19:14:01]

CDR: Oh, is that right? It's been so busy.

[03:19:14:02]
CC: Oh, yeah. It's worn the thing out at the
     bearings. (Laughter)

[03:19:14:33]
CDR: Hey, Ken, tell the people if you see anything
     getting close to the gimbal lock to be sure and
     whistle, too, will you?

[03:19:14:40]
CC: We sure will, Frank. You will want to make sure
     one of you keeps your COMM carrier on.

[03:19:14:43]
CDR: We'll keep one man with a headset on.

[03:19:14:50]
CDR: That's right. We'll keep one man with a COMM
     carrier on.

[03:19:19:39]

     voice, but the data is good.

[03:19:28:53]

CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[03:19:32:23]
LMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[03:19:32:25]
CC: Okay. In order for us to handle the antenna
     switching, I guess we'd like to have the AUX
     tape switched to OFF, and the tape FORWARD
     switch OFF; and we'll be switching between
     OMNI's Bravo and Delta.

[03:19:33:01]
LMP: Between what and what?

[03:19:33:05]
CC: Okay. We are going to be switching between
     OMNI's Bravo and Delta.

[03:19:33:14]
LMP: Okay.

[03:19:33:17]
CC: Alright. And I'm gonna - you bug me when you
     get over 50 degrees of yaw, so I'll probably
     be watching that number pretty closely. We'd
     like to have the BIOMED switched to the right
     position. Okay. And for your own information:
     the fuel we show in the different quads I have
     here if you would like to copy it.

[03:19:34:07]
LMP: Stand by.

[03:19:35:50]
LMP: Okay. Ready to copy.

[03:19:35:54]
CC: Okay. I'll give you the percentage on Alfa 60,
     Bravo 57, Charlie ...

[03:19:36:11]
_page : 5
LMP: Wait a minute. It asks for present time, and
     I can't plot that fast, Ken.

[03:19:36:15]
CC: Okay. I'm sorry. Alfa is 60.

[03:19:36:22]
LMP: For what time?

[03:19:36:26]

[03:19:36:35]

CC: And Delta 57.33842.

[03:19:37:33]
LMP: That's a coincidence.
     That's just what I worked out on Lovell's slide rule.

[03:19:37:46]
LMP: How are we doing on the cryos?

[03:19:37:52]
CC: Oh, you've got some pretty good numbers on
     that that I sent up yesterday, and you had
     about 160 hours. Well, I'll check that out,
     but you were fat on cryo. I've got some SPS
     DELTA-V. You've got 33:20. You fly the service
     module RCS through the DAP. You have 142; and
     through SCS, it's 121.

[03:19:38:43]
LMP: Roger.

[03:19:39:55]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We can't monitor on low
     bit rate whether you started your fuel cell
     purge. If you haven't, we can still go ahead
     and start now; and if you can, keep us posted
     as you go through it.

[03:19:40:08]
_page : 6
LMP: Roger. You want an O<sub>2</sub> and an H<sub>2</sub> purge, Ken?

[03:19:40:12]
CC: That's affirmative.

[03:19:40:18]
LMP: You shall have it.

[03:19:40:19]
CC: Thank you.

[03:19:51:59]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston - -

[03:19:52:05]
LMP: Go ahead.

[03:19:52:07]
CC: It looks like you may be in OMNI Alfa. Can
     you confirm that we're set up to switch between
     Bravo and Delta?

[03:19:52:29]
LMP: You are now.

[03:19:52:31]
CC: Okay. Thank you very much. And you are in the
     fuel cell purge?

[03:19:52:39]
LMP: It's complete.

[03:19:52:41]
CC: Okay. Understand the purge is complete. Thank
     you. And in reference to your cryo, it looks
     like we'll have 180 pounds in each oxygen tank
     at SEP and 11 pounds in each hydrogen tank.
     And you're well above the single tank capability.

[03:19:53:16]
LMP: Okay. Thank you.

     Los Angeles Dodger pitcher, Sandy Koufax, and
     Ann Widmark, 23-year-old daughter of actor Richard
     Widmark, plan to marry some time in the near
     future. Koufax said Tuesday that no date for the
     wedding was set, but he and Miss Widmark have
     been dating for some time. At Springfield, - -

CMP: Morning. How do you read?

[03:23:11:51]
CC: Good morning, Jim.

[03:23:11:55]
CC: Let's see. In Springfield, Missouri, Mickey Owen,
     the old-time catcher for the Brooklyn Dodgers who
     made the record books by dropping a third strike
     that led the New York Yankees to a victory over
     the Dodgers in the '41 World Series, decided that
     he would be remembered by more than just his
     sports record. Forty-five boys and girls have
     been the recipients of ponies that he offered.
     These youngsters were requested to send letters
     in telling him how they would care for a pony.
     When the letters poured in, he added five ponies
     to the 20 he already offered; and other donors
     pitched in 20 more. And said Mickey Owen, "I
     thought I'd have about 45 letters, but I ended
     up with about 900." Now on the feature page:
     Wellington, New Zealand, about fifty men sat
     down to the traditional turkey and cranberry
     sauce at the South Pole today, but the Christmas
     had an Oriental flavor, as well. It included
     Sukiyaki cooked by members of a Japanese party
     who are crossing the Antarctic continent and
     stopped for the day with the U.S. Navy Polar
     base. In San Diego, California, the crewmen
     of the captured intelligence ship Pueblo donated
     their first paychecks to the workers at San
     Diego's Balboa Naval Hospital. They had all been
     given twenty dollars each, and - when they
     landed in San Diego - and they felt that this
     was a good demonstration of their feelings for
     those who had done so much to make their welcome
     here.

[03:23:14:43]
CC: In Reno, Nevada, because there is no fireplace
     in his home, ... a little boy wrote Santa Claus
     in care of the local newspaper and suggested,
     "would you please use the front door. You will
     have to kick the bottom a little bit because
     it sticks." In Little Rock, Arkansas, babies
     born at St. Vincent Infirmary during the week
     before Christmas and through Christmas Day are
     being released to their mothers at discharge
     time in huge red Christmas stockings. Here is
     one in ecumenical cooperation. In Indio,
     California, the Chief of Police was armed
     Christmas Day with a prayer book. Rabbi Phillip
     H. Weinburg has taken over as Chief for a day
     so the real Police Chief, Homer Hunt, a Methodist
     could spend the holiday with his family. This
     is the third straight Christmas the Rabbi has
     filled in for Hunt. The previous 6 years,
     Rabbi Weinburg did the same for the Roman
     Catholic Police Chief of Reno, Nevada.

[03:23:16:00]
CC: Prom the Associated Press, Americans watch
     Pope Paul celebrate Christmas Mass in Italy,
     and Europeans viewed a Christmas greeting from
     Apollo 8 via the most powerful communications
     satellite yet sent aloft. The news of Pope Paul
     and the Apollo 8 crew Tuesday night were the
     first to be relayed across the Atlantic commercially
     by Intelsat III, which was launched
     from Cape Kennedy last Wednesday. That's the
     one we saw go.

[03:23:16:37]
_page : 7
CDR: Roger. I remember that.

[03:23:16:40]
CC: Intelsat is a 63-nation international communication
     consortium; provides a chart on the first
     global communications network. The new satellite
     is scheduled to begin full commercial service
     on January 2, initially serving North and South
     America and Europe. Further coverage of the
     Apollo 8 mission is to be relayed to Europe this
     week.

[03:23:17:15]
CC: From Washington: "This Christmas, the world is
     brightened with the hope of peace. When it
     comes, when hope turns to substance and the guns
     are quiet once again, it will come because you
     have pursued it with courage and skill." This
     was a message from President Johnson to the Armed
     Forces on Christmas.

[03:23:17:46]
CC: Here is a feature by Harry Rosenthal of Associated
     Press. It says: from Houston. Two Santas
     brighten the Christmas Eve for 2-year-old Jeffrey
     Lovell. The first one knocked on his front door
     and brought presents. The second started his
     daddy home from the moon. The first wore a
     red suit and a white beard and ho, ho'd loud
     enough to be heard down the block. The second
     was a huge engine spitting flame behind the
     moon, and thousands of people were awaiting
     word that it had fired. "Please be informed
     that there is a Santa Claus" were the first
     words from Apollo 8 as it emerged from radio
     silence to inform an anxious world 15 minutes
     after the fact that the engine had performed
     its critical burn. "None of us ever expect
     to have a better Christmas present than this
     one," said Ken Mattingly of Mission Control.
     "Thank everyone on the ground for us. You
     know we couldn't have done it without you,"
     came the reply from Col. Frank Borman, the
     spacecraft commander. At this point, a Christmas
     tree came aglow in front of the consoles in
     Mission Control, and Astronaut Harrison Schmidt
     read a space version of "A visit from Saint
     Nicholas" to the crew. "Twas the night before
     Christmas, and way out in space, the Apollo 8
     crew had just won the moon race," it began.
     The Mission Control crew had delayed the
     celebration until Jeffrey's daddy, Navy Captain
     James Lovell, along with Air Force Major William
     A. Anders and Col. Borman were safely on their
     way home. Any other Christmas Eve, the families
     of the astronauts would have been in church for
     Christmas services, but this year they were all
     glued to their television sets. The homes all
     near the Manned Spacecraft Center were decorated.
     The lawns around the Lovell home and throughout
     his community of Timber Cove were lined with
     Mexican style luminarios, and the four Lovell
     children came out to light them about 7:30. They
     were just in time. At 8:00, a car drove up
     carrying a tall Santa Claus with a large sack
     on his back. He ho ho'd up to the door and
     knocked loudly. It opened, and there stood
     Jeffrey Lovell who will be 3 on January 14.
     Jeffrey recoiled at the sight. His mother held
     him up, and Jeffrey clung to her, still shying
     away. "Last year he ran away crying," saying
     his 15-year old sister Barbara. Earlier, she
     had to run after him to prevent his blowing
     out all the luminaries. The other Lovell children,
     13-year-old James and 10-year-old Susan watched
     with great amusement. Finally, the Santa and
     the children disappeared inside; the presents
     were put under the tree; presents not to be
     opened until today. Mrs. Lovell prepared egg
     nog and cookies for the guests, and they watched
     a 25-minute televised tour of the moon conducted
     by the three astronauts. Later, friends took
     Mrs. Lovell, Barbara, and Jeffrey on a tour of
     the neighborhood brightly lighted for Christmas.
     Above them in a clear sky, the quarter moon shone
     brightly, and the three astronauts, who more than
     any other men have seen the fruits of creation,
     pause in their scientific exploration there to
     beam to the earth the majestic word; from Genesis.
     "And God created the firmament heavens, and God
     called the dry land Earth, and God saw that it
     was good."

CDR: We would enjoy it.

[04:00:26:32]
CC: Roger. We will start out with the world news.
     On page 1 of the Houston Post: praise for America's
     Apollo 8 astronauts and hopes for international
     cooperation in space exploration with the worldwide
     Christmas Eve messages as the tiny spaceship
     orbited the moon. Even in the Communist world,
     there was enthusiasm for man's first voyage to the
     moon. In Moscow, Soviet scientist Anatoly Besaranov
     recalled his country and the United States had
     shared space knowledge before and predicted the
     Apollo 8 flight would lead to more cooperation.
     In Cuba, Radio Havana rebroadcast the Voice of
     America program to tell its listeners of the
     Apollo 8 speech. Voice officials said it was the
     first time that any of the U.S. agencies' programs
     had been carried by Havana radio. Czechoslovakia
     saw the moon flight through extensive television
     coverage; and in Budapest, Hungary, people talk of
     little else on the trains and buses. In the
     non-Communist world, office workers and Christmas
     shoppers held their breath as the spacecraft was
     readied for the blast toward earth. Frenchmen in
     the street praised American knowhow and the space
     feat, and some viewers watch television lunar
     photos cheer "Magnifique!". In London, swarms
     of Christmas shoppers crowded into shops and pubs
     to watch television photographs of the moon's
     craters. Britain's foremost space astronomer,
     Bernard Lovell, who until a few weeks ago
     criticized the Apollo 8 project on the grounds
     that instruments could do the job without
     risking the astronauts' lives, made it clear that
     he was deeply impressed by the moon flight.
     Pope Paul VI said honor to those pioneers of the
     extension of man's intellect and activity. There
     were only a few scrooges that "pooh pooh-ed" the
     Christmas voyage, however. The most notable
     was Samual Shenton, secretary of London's Flat Earth
     Society, who said the public are being balihooed,
     taken for a ride. How does that grab you, Frank?

[04:00:29:00]
_page : 4
CDR: It doesn't look too flat from here, but I don't
     know; maybe something is wrong with our vision.

[04:00:29:07]
CC: Roger. Elsewhere in the world news, the
     Pueblo crew landed at NAS Miramar yesterday afternoon
     at 14:00, and they will spend a few days
     there in Balboa Hospital with their families
     celebrating Christmas. On the local scene here,
     the Retail Merchants' Association has announced
     that its Christmas gift exchange policy is going
     to be the same this year as it was last year;
     that is, very liberal. Fellows, we will be glad
     to replace any broken items that you might bring
     back, too; but, sorry, there won't be any cash refunds.

[04:00:30:54]
_page : 5
CDR: Okay.

[04:00:30:57]
CC: Another little of local news: the County
     Court House at Huntsville burned down before
     dawn yesterday, so it looks like they will go in
     the construction business there again. On the
     feature page: got a little bit about the waiting
     families. This one is by Ann James, Post reporter.
     "We rest on the backside of the moon," said Valerie
     Anders on Christmas Eve, as she and her family
     waited for Apollo 8 to get out of the moon orbit
     and head back toward home. Mrs. Anders had been
     up since 2:00 a.m. Tuesday, and neighbors had
     just collected all the youngsters so the family
     could get some rest while the spacecraft was
     behind the moon and out of communication. Colonel
     Frank Borman's home was decorated with four big
     evergreen wreaths outdoors and sprinkled with
     powdery snow and decorated with red bows. A
     tree in the den awaits his safe return, and his
     pretty blond wife Sue and husky sons, Frederick
     and Edwin, plan to stay home for the midnight
     blast out of moon orbit. Ordinarily, they would
     attend midnight services at St. Christopher's
     L Episcopal Church. The plans were for the family
     to go to Christmas Day service at 7:00 a.m. Since
     there are no young children in the Borman home,
     family Christmas gift giving will simply wait
     until Colonel Borman comes back with his fantastic
     holiday gift of the flight to the moon and back.
     Marilyn Lovell's four youngsters will have an
     absolutely normal Christmas as far as the kids
     are concerned, the busy wife of Captain Lovell
     reported; but talking about presents was out
     because two of them were sitting right there next
     to her. "I haven't even had time to change my
     clothes that I wore last night," Mrs. Lovell said.
     Adult-to-adult gifts, however, and the Christmas
     tree will still be right there when Lovell comes
     home. Here is a good one on the Action Line.
     There is a little letter to the Action editor.
     It says, "We intended to pay you Earthlings a
     surprise visit by a flying saucer last night.
     We got scared off by some crazy antics of a
     fat man and a sleigh and three guys in a rocket-powered
     bucket drag racing around the moon. Is
     that anyway to run a planet?" Signed the boys
     from Mars. Frank, it looks like the only people
     around here who aren't impressed by the Apollo 8
     is the stock market. Its 30 industrials are down
     1.43.

CC: (laughter) You-bet. On the sports page, not too
     much activity. UCLA is tops in both basketball
     polls. If you got any particular one you want
     to ask about, let me know, and I'll tell you if
     they are in the top ten on either poll. As far
     as the North - the college All Star game that is
     going to be played tomorrow is concerned, the
     North is a slight favorite over the South. Ara
     Parsegian is the coach of the North team, and
     he's got six of the Notre Dame troops working for
     him, so they ought to be pretty tough. The coach
     of the South team is Frank Howard of Clemson. He
     says it ain't easy, he quips, to build a team in
     4 days to play Notre Dame. Another little item
     of interest in the sports page is Woody Hayes from
     Ohio State was named Coach of the Year by the
     Football Writers' Association. Well, that's about
     it. Any questions?

     have Guidance figure out a corridor correction
     at 114 hours for us with a minus 648 cabin.

[04:01:03:03]
CC: Okay, Jim. We copy, and now we see we've got
     VERB 64 back. We'll be back with you in a
     minute.

[04:01:03:12]
CMP: Roger.

[04:01:29:08]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[04:01:29:13]
CMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[04:01:29:15]
CC: Roger. We have a comparison now on your P37.

[04:01:29:24]
CMP: Roger.

[04:01:29:26]
CC: Okay. Based on your vector, the CMC vector,
     the ground computes 15.3 feet per second on
     the midcourse, VEI of 36221, a gamma EI of
     minus 6.51 so it looks like your P37 program
     is pretty good. Applying your P37 solution
     to our MSFN vector, however, we get a gamma
     EI of minus 10.32. We expect these two solutions
     to converge with a little more tracking
     and after you get some earth horizon sightings.
     Over.

[04:01:30:11]
CMP: Roger. How valuable do you think that the
     lunar we did just after TPIR as compared to
     your MSFN tracking? Go ahead, Houston.

[04:01:30:46]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Repeat your question,
     please.

[04:01:30:52]
_page : 2
CMP: Roger. I was getting curious of the value of
     onboard tracking in the P23 course close to
     the moon, in regards to the MSFN tracking that
     close to the moon. I think there might be a
     trail-off for onboard navigation, and I think
     it might be a little bit better than MSFN
     tracking.

[04:01:31:20]
CC: Roger. Stand by.

[04:01:33:00]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:01:33:04]
CMP: Go ahead.

[04:01:33:06]
CC: Roger. I guess the experts would say that the
     MSFN data was probably best based or the number
     of sightings that you have taken. However,
     that's going to be the subject of quite a bit
     of evaluation, I think, after the mission. Over.

[04:01:33:24]
CMP: ...

[04:01:33:27]
CC: Roger, Jim. Be advised that we are beginning
     to read you very weak, and with a rather loud
     background noise.

[04:01:33:38]
CMP: Understand. ...

[04:01:33:59]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read now?

[04:01:54:04]
CMP: I'm reading - I'm reading you loud and clear.

[04:01:54:06]
CC: Roger. Still reading you weak but clearer.

[04:01:54:55]

     charger. Over.

CC: Roger. Is this Jim?

[04:02:04:34]
CMP: Roger.

[04:02:04:36]
CC: Roger, Jim. Christmas morning around your house
     was kinda quiet, says Marilyn. She said that
     they are all thankful the mission has gone so
     great. They missed having you around the tree
     this morning, but they wanted to reassure you
     that your presents are waiting, and the roast
     beef and Yorkshire pudding will be on the table
     when you get home.

[04:02:04:58]
CMP: Hey, that sounds good, Jerry - good old roast
     beef and Yorkshire pudding.

[04:02:05:02]
CC: Yeah, man. Is Frank listening?

[04:02:05:04]
CMP: Say hello to them for me, will you?

[04:02:05:05]
CC: Sure will. Is Frank listening?

[04:02:05:06]
CMP: Frank's not on the line yet; he will be shortly.

[04:02:05:12]
CC: Okay. How about Bill? Is he still asleep?

[04:02:05:18]
CMP: Bill is still asleep.

[04:02:05:20]
CC: Okay. Have Frank give me a holler when he is
     ready. I've got a message for him, too.

[04:02:05:28]
CMP: Okay. Sounds good. How is your Christmas,
     Jerry?

[04:02:05:31]
CC: Real good, Jim. Santa Claus struck last night
     before I came in here on the shift, and I guess
     we will finish off the unwrapping this morning
     when I get back.

[04:02:05:45]
_page : 4
CMP: Right. He was looking for a chimney on 103 here,
     but he didn't see any.

[04:02:05:50]
CC: (Laughter) You could have left the hatch unlocked
     for him.

[04:02:06:08]
CMP: I'll think about that one.

[04:02:06:10]
CC: Think real hard, Jim. EECOM says he could
     have slid down the steam duct.

[04:02:06:37]
CMP: Sounds good. About that time, Bill would have
     been boiling water.

[04:02:06:53]
CDR: Hey, Jerry, this is Frank. What's up?

[04:02:06:55]
CC: Hi, Frank. Christmas morning has come at the
     Borman house. And the boys and Susan and
     your Mom and Dad all send their love. They
     say for you to stay in there and pitch. Over.

[04:02:07:11]
CDR: Okay. Thank you. Please reciprocate for me.

[04:02:07:16]
CC: Sure will, Frank.

[04:02:07:27]
CC: Frank, when Bill wakes up, give me a holler.
     I've got a message for him, too.

[04:02:07:35]
CDR: Okay.

[04:02:15:23]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[04:02:15:26]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go.

[04:02:15:31]
CMP: Roger. Are the Guidance boys busy this
     morning?

[04:02:15:41]
_page : 5
CC: They say they are.

[04:02:15:49]
CMP: I just worked out an answer to move my landing
     longitude 6 degrees east. I just want to compare
     with what they've got based on the same
     burn time of 114 hours, based on the bias impact
     longitude determined from the P37 which is
     wrong. I've indicated that I need 606 foot
     per second DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> burn plus, and my DELTA-V<sub>X</sub>
     changes from a minus 11.6 feet per second. I'd
     like to have them verify that if I could.

[04:02:16:29]
CC: Roger Jim. Standby, and I'll see if they
     copied all that.

[04:02:17:30]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:02:17:34]
CMP: Go ahead.

[04:02:17:35]
CC: The voice isn't too great right now, and the
     Guidance troops didn't get all of that. How
     about waiting about 2 or 3 minutes? We'll swap
     OMNI antennas, and then we should get good voice
     transmission from you and then repeat it.
     Would you, please?

[04:02:17:54]
CMP: Roger.

[04:02:17:55]
CC: Okay.

[04:02:22:55]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read? Over.

[04:02:23:00]
CDR: Loud and clear.

[04:02:23:01]
CC: Roger. We're reading you much better now.
     Jim can go ahead with his transmission to the
     guidance troops. They have one question before
     he starts. They would like to know what his
     GERU was at TIG, 114 hours. Over.

[04:02:23:21]
_page : 6
CDR: Roger. Wait one. The GERU at TIG was plus
     07972.

[04:02:23:35]
CC: Roger. Plus 07972.

[04:02:25:07]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. We are ready to
     copy your data. Over.

[04:02:25:14]
CMP: Okay, Houston. Based on the P37 with minus
     MA solution, I got an impact longitude of
     minus 160.95. I biased it to get an impact
     latitude - longitude of 163.75. I wanted to
     change change my impact point 30 degrees to the east,
     and I tried to determine what my P30 burn
     parameters would be to do this, and I got a
     DELTA-V<sub>X</sub> burn of minus 11.6 and a DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> of
     plus 600, DELTA-V<sub>Y</Y> of zero. Now that changed
     my previous DELTA-V<sub>X</sub> burn from minus 50.2. I
     just want to know whether that meets with
     their approval.

[04:02:26:15]
CC: Roger, Jim. We copy and will run it through
     the mill and give you an answer.

[04:02:26:23]
CMP: Roger.

     update.

[04:02:49:48]
CDR: Go ahead.

[04:02:49:50]
CC: Roger. At 100 hours 30 minutes, change star
     number 02 from one set to two set. Over.

     change star number 11 to star number 7. Over.

[04:02:50:21]
CDR: Roger. Eleven to 7.

[04:02:50:23]
CC: Roger. Then after star set number 3, initiate
     PTC again; pitch 10, yaw 45. Over.
     04 50 36 CDR Pitch 10, yaw 45.

[04:02:50:38]
CC: Roger. Then at 101 hours 30 minutes, delete the
     earth horizon settings. Over.

[04:02:50:53]
CDR: 101:30, delete the earth horizons sightings.

[04:02:50:57]
CC: That's affirmative. The folks here are evaluating
     the thermal situation. Looks like you will be
     out of PTC rather at an extended period of time.
     That's the reason we have you initiating PTC again
     there around 101 as soon as you finish those three
     star sightings. We are still working on the -
     about the next 10 hours after 100 hours. We are
     looking at the thermal situation, and the star
     sighting situation, and we will be giving you more
     updates later on. Over.

[04:02:51:32]
_page : 2
CDR: Roger. We don't have a thermal problem at all
     now, do we? All our indications here are normal
     in here.

[04:02:51:40]
CC: Roger. Everything looks okay. I think they're
     just kinda trying to look down the track aways.

[04:02:51:47]
CDR: I'm all for keeping it that way.

[04:02:51:50]
CC: Roger.

[04:02:51:53]
CDR: We deleted them.

[04:02:51:55]
CC: Okay.

[04:02:56:53]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:02:56:59]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[04:02:57:00]
CC: Roger. Frank, I would like to talk to you for a
     minute or two about the AUTO OPTICS funnies that
     you have been seeing throughout the mission. Over.

[04:02:57:11]
CMP: Go ahead.

[04:02:57:13]
CC: Roger. The problems you have run into so far are
     due to some unknown source, probably EMI or the like
     loading your CMC trunnion cell which is now 91, so
     it doesn't really represent your true trunnion angle.
     Now this loading problem we don't feel implies any
     decrease in the reliability in your CMC at all. We
     think that the best way to circumvent the problem
     is to cycle the OPTICS ZERO switch first to OFF and
     then ON prior to using the optics for any purpose.
     And with that procedure, I think you probably won't
     have any more problems. Over.

[04:02:58:01]
_page : 3
CMP: Roger, Jerry. Understand. I do notice one difference.
     We did preferred REFSMMAT's. The first
     we had trouble with; the last one worked out as
     expected. I noticed for the first one that when
     the option came up, it was for nominal option,
     whereas for the very same procedure for this last
     REFSMMAT change, we got ... preferred REFSMMAT
     option. ...

[04:02:58:27]
CC: Roger, Jim. Copy.

[04:03:00:56]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston with a comeback on
     your entry navigation calculations. Over.

[04:03:01:05]
CDR: Go ahead.

[04:03:01:07]
CC: Roger. We went through the charts and got exactly
     the same answer as you got.  Looks like your procedure
     is very good; looks like it was real good
     head.  You remembered to average out the velocity.
     We also went ahead and computed the problem to
     verify the chart and got a good solution. Over.

[04:03:01:30]
CMP: Roger.

[04:03:01:33]
CDR: Thank you very much.

[04:03:01:35]
CC: You're welcome.

[04:03:01:40]

     we'll be in business.

[04:03:20:08]
CC: Roger. On your question about the option: PROGRAM
     40 sets the preferred flag such that the
     next P52 will come up option 1, subsequent alignments
     after that come up option 2. Over.

[04:03:20:27]
CMP: Roger. Understand. So 40 will have to come up
     with a TIG burn with an option 1 for us.

[04:03:20:34]
CC: Roger. Now concerning your restart that happened
     in lunar orbit, for the peace of mid of the computer
     people and the MIT folks, we have a question
     Did VERB 34 ENTER to a flashing VERB 51 in
     P22 cause your restart? Over.

[04:03:20:56]

[04:03:55:03]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We're showing quad A running
     a little bit warmer than the other quads. If you
     remember, I mentioned before that we were coming
     into a period of time here where we were going to
     spend a lot of time with no PTC going. We'd
     like for you to try to favor quad A if you can
     in the shade, and do whatever you can to keep
     that temperature from getting out of hand. Over.

[04:03:55:31]

[04:03:55:35]

     142.

[04:03:56:01]
CC: Roger, Frank. We are more interested in the tank
     temperatures than the quad temperatures. Over.

[04:03:56:10]
CDR: Roger. I understand. Now listen, if you think
     it is that important, we'll just keep PTC-ing it
     and not even do anything.

[04:03:56:17]
CC: Negative. There's no sweat right now. We're
     watching it, and we just wanted to let you know
     that this thing is being looked at. If we get
     anywhere near a situation where we feel we ought
     to change, we'll go back to PTC or cool it.

[04:03:56:33]
CDR: Okay. Thank you. We'll do our best, but it is
     kind of hard, though. You are sort of subject of
     spatial geometry: wherever the stars and the moon
     happens to be, that's where you point.

[04:03:56:44]
CC: Roger. We understand. We're going to keep an
     eye on it down here, and we'll keep you appraised.

     that we are watching on quad A has only gone
     up 1 degree in all this work that you are
     doing, so we don't consider it to be too
     terribly serious. What we would like to do,
     as soon as you finish this P23 work, is rather
     than go back into PTC, let's just roll her
     over 180 degrees and put quad A on the cool

CC: Roger. All zeros, all zeros. Okay. On star
     number 7, we missed the trunnion on marks 1, 2,
     and 3.

[04:04:55:13]
CDR: On 1, trunnion was 03235; on 2, it was 03240;
     on 3, it was 03241.

[04:04:55:31]
CC: Okay, Frank. And then the last one is on star
     number 1; we missed the trunnion on mark 5.

[04:04:55:41]
CDR: 04064.

[04:04:55:46]
CC: Roger, 04064.

[04:04:55:53]
CDR: Righto.

[04:04:55:55]
CC: Thank you, Frank.

[04:04:55:58]
CDR: You're welcome, Jerry.

[04:04:56:03]
CC: That Lowell's getting pretty proficient.

[04:04:56:07]
CDR: Not bad.

[04:04:57:41]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:04:57:46]
CDR: Go ahead.

[04:04:57:47]
CC: Was that last number you read down to me mark 2
     on star number 1?

[04:04:57:59]
CDR: That's right. Star number 1, mark 7.

[04:04:58:03]
CC: Roger. Thank you. Now that one got you on
     guidance.

[04:04:58:16]
CDR: Okay.

[04:05:03:10]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. You're back under our
     influence again. Over.

[04:05:03:16]
CDR: Very good. Things start speeding up now, huh?

[04:05:03:21]
CC: Roger. You've been in for about 20 minutes.

[04:05:03:26]
CDR: Very good.

[04:05:03:29]
_page : 4
CMP: Jerry, this is Jim.

[04:05:03:31]
CC: Go ahead, Jim.

[04:05:03:35]
CMP: Find out from the Guidance group if a midcourse
     maneuver of minus 4.8 to access corridor at
     14 hours would be better than the 15.2 I came
     up with first.

[04:05:03:47]
CC: Okay. Minus 4.8.

[04:05:03:52]
CMP: Right.

[04:05:03:54]
CC: We have already started checking it, Jim. I
     bet you think you sneaked that P37 past us.

[04:05:04:06]
CMP: Big brother is watching.

[04:05:04:09]

[04:05:12:32]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go.

[04:05:12:43]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go.

[04:05:12:47]
CDR: Roger. I just wondered how temp on quad A tank
     is doing.

[04:05:12:54]
CC: We have seen no improvement as yet, Frank.

[04:05:13:00]
CDR: How hot is it?

[04:05:13:03]
CC: Eighty-six degrees.

[04:05:13:07]
CDR: Roger.

[04:05:17:28]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:05:17:32]
CDR: Go ahead.

[04:05:17:34]
CC: Roger. Frank, we are going to establish a
     range sequence now. We would like to keep
     silence on the net for about 3 minutes. Over.

[04:05:17:44]

     Over.

[04:05:21:26]
CDR: Thank you.

[04:05:28:13]
CDR: Hello, Houston. Apollo 8. How do you read?

[04:05:28:16]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear.

[04:05:29:11]
CDR: Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.

[04:05:29:14]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear by me.

[04:05:29:19]
CDR: I wasn't reading you for a while. I read you
     loud and clear now.

[04:05:29:22]
CC: Roger, Frank.

[04:05:29:28]
CDR: I wanted to know what a range sequence test
     was, Jerry.

[04:05:29:35]
CC: I was afraid you was going to ask that. Stand
     by.

[04:05:30:53]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:05:30:57]
CDR: Go ahead.

[04:05:30:59]
CC: Roger. This range sequence is a phenomenon
     we get on down-voice backup; in this mode,
     the ranging and the voice share the same channels,
     so we have to periodically check and make
     sure that they are not interfering with each
     other. Over.

[04:05:31:16]
CDR: Thank you. These flights are very educational.

[04:05:31:28]
CC: Roger. We are learning a little bit down here,
     too.

[04:05:31:38]
CDR: I hope you're not studying reentry.

[04:05:31:46]
_page : 6
CC: No, we're fat on those, Frank.

[04:05:31:51]
CDR: Okay.

[04:05:39:12]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:05:39:16]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[04:05:39:18]
CC: Roger, Frank. We would like for you to go back
     into PTC now. Your helium tank temperature is
     still holding about the same. And we are going
     to try PTC to even things out. Over.

[04:05:39:32]
CDR: Okay.

[04:05:40:49]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:05:40:53]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[04:05:40:54]
CC: Is Jim listening?

[04:05:40:58]
CDR: He's off the air right now.

[04:05:41:01]
CC: Roger, Frank. Let him know that we've compared
     his latest P37, and the state vectors have converged
     to - they are very, very close now.

[04:05:41:13]
CDR: Your state vector and our state vector are
     very, very close.

[04:05:41:16]
CC: That's affirmative, Frank.

[04:05:41:18]
CDR: Is that right, Jerry? Okay. I'll tell him.
     Thank you.

[04:05:41:21]
CC: Roger.

[04:05:41:27]
CC: Don't let his head get big, though.

[04:05:41:32]
CDR: You guys are going to make it impossible to
     live with him. It always was pretty hard.

     COMMAND RESET to get the lock back on again,
     but you're welcome to the antenna.

[04:05:51:21]

[04:06:07:13]
LMP: Good morning, Michael.

[04:06:07:15]
CC: Good morning.

[04:06:07:17]
LMP: Or is it afternoon?

[04:06:07:23]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. You've got a lot of
     background noise and about unreadable. We're
     trying to get a better OMNI.

[04:06:07:45]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read? Over.

[04:06:07:50]
LMP: Loud and clear.

[04:06:07:51]
CC: Okay. You're loud and clear. Is this Bill?

[04:06:07:57]
LMP: None other.

[04:06:07:58]
CC: I got a message for you while you were asleep.
     Valerie said to tell you that she and the kids
     are leaving for church about 11:30 and eagerly
     awaiting your return. She said presents are
     magically starting to appear under the Christmas
     tree again so it looks like a double barrel
     Christmas. Over.

[04:06:08:16]
_page : 2
LMP: You can't beat a deal like that. How was
     Christmas at your house today?

[04:06:08:26]
CC: Early and busy as usual. I told Michael you
     guys are up there, and he said who's driving?

[04:06:08:39]
LMP: That's a good question. I think Isaac Newton
     is doing most of the driving right now.

[04:06:08:51]
CC: Say again.

[04:06:08:55]
LMP: I think Isaac Newton is doing most of the
     driving right now.

[04:06:08:59]
CC: Roger. We copy.

[04:06:09:40]
LMP: Tell Valerie and the kids a Merry Christmas
     for me, Mike, and tell them I'll see them
     there in a while.

[04:06:09:46]
CC: I sure will, and you might tell Frank if
     he's got any messages his people are about
     10 feet away.

[04:06:09:57]
LMP: He said "bah humbug."

[04:06:10:01]
CDR: Howdy, how are you all?

[04:06:10:06]

     using the Exer-Genie right now.

[04:06:10:19]

[04:06:10:23]
CDR: I won't.

CC: Roger. Quad Able helium tank temperature has
     dropped very slightly and is looking pretty
     good to us now.

[04:06:16:11]
LMP: Thank you, Michael.

[04:06:16:12]
CC: Righto, and I've got a procedure for Jim I
     would like to read up. It involves bringing
     the LM and the CSM state vectors to the earth's 
     sphere of influence. Over.

[04:06:16:27]
LMP: Alright. Stand by.

[04:06:16:29]
CC: Okay.

[04:06:16:34]
LMP: He's getting his hat on now. Whose procedure
     is this, Michael?

[04:06:16:41]
CC: Oh, it's the summation of the opinions of all
     our experts down here. I got it from
     Mr. Colossus, Gunther Sabionski.

[04:06:16:54]
LMP: Very good. I want to make sure it wasn't
     an Aldrin special.

[04:06:17:03]
CC: I'm sorry you're broken up. Don't say again.
     (Laughter)

[04:06:17:16]
CMP: Merry Christmas, Bud.

[04:06:17:25]
CC: Yes, Merry Christmas up there, Jim. I've
     got a procedure when you are ready to copy.

[04:06:17:31]
CMP: Okay. I just got on my headset; just let
     me get a pencil and paper, and I will copy
     it.

[04:06:17:36]
CC: Okay.

[04:06:17:58]
_page : 4
CMP: Okay, Mike.

[04:06:18:00]
CC: Okay. The purpose is to bring the LM and
     the CSM state vectors to earth's sphere of
     influence. Step one: Verb 37 ENTER, 23 ENTER.
     Step two: At NOUN 70, at NOUN 70, load in
     register 1, 2, and 3 the following numbers.
     Register 1, 00002; register 2, five balls;
     register 3, 00210. Step 3: proceed on NOUN 70,
     NOUN 70. Step 4: proceed on NOUN 25, 25.
     Step 5: do not proceed on NOUN 18. Wait
     for 30 seconds; then do VERB 37 ENTER, 00
     ENTER. End of procedure. Over.

[04:06:19:29]
CMP: Okay. As I understand that the reason for
     this procedure is to bring
     the LM and CSM state vectors back to the earth's sphere
     of influence; is that correct?

[04:06:19:37]
CC: That's correct.

[04:06:19:42]
CMP: Okay. To do it we go VERB 37 ENTER, 23 ENTER;
     and at the NOUN 70, we'll load in register 1,
     four balls 2; register 2, all balls; and
     register 3, two balls 210. We'll proceed
     on NOUN 70 and proceed on NOUN 25. We'll
     not proceed on 18. We'll wait 30 seconds,
     and we'll do a VERB 37 ENTER, 00 ENTER.

[04:06:20:15]
CC: That's affirmative. Apollo 8.

[04:06:20:21]
_page : 5
CMP: I'm just kinda curious, Mike; I thought this
     was done for us. I thought the computer took
     care of this little problem.

[04:06:20:34]
CC: Roger. Normally, it is done automatically,
     Jim; and had you done the P23's exactly as
     scheduled, it would have been, but there was
     some doubt P23 was stopped about 7 minutes
     prior to the transition point and just to be
     absolutely sure, we included this procedure.
     Over.

[04:06:20:59]
CMP: Okay. Tell Buzz I sure could use his eye-patch.

[04:06:21:19]
CC: Roger. I understand. Buzz had one on Gemini X,
     worked real well.

[04:06:21:28]
CMP: Mike, do you want me to do this procedure now?

[04:06:21:31]
CC: That's affirmative, Jim. Now at your convenience.

[04:06:24:06]

[04:06:30:02]

[04:06:30:10]

     Go ahead and say what you were saying about
     the program office.

[04:06:33:57]
CDR: They ought to get some moving out on some
     way to fix these windows. The three windows,
     the hatch window and the two side windows,
     really it's a shame, in fact, that they are
     almost totally unusable, because they got so
     gummed up.

[04:06:34:17]
CC: Roger. I sure agree. We copy so far on the
     windows that 2 and 4 are in excellent shape
     and 1 and 5 are sort of mediocre and 3 is just
     about totally unusable.

[04:06:34:34]
_page : 7

     for any kind of photography.

[04:06:34:42]
CMP: And, Mike, that sure puts the CMP in a bad
     light, you know, when you can't see where
     you are going.

[04:06:34:48]
CC: Yes. And when you're setting between two
     guys that won't tell you, too. (Laughter)

[04:06:34:54]
CMP: That's right. You think they will share a
     window? No soap. You might also note the
     optics are very good visibility; so far, no
     coating at all.

[04:06:35:04]

CC: Roger. We got those loads in and verified;
     you can go back BLOCK at your computer. And
     George Low says he's working on that window
     problem at 6, or spacecraft 104. You just
     happen to have the wrong spacecraft.

[04:06:55:40]
CDR: That's the wrong statement; we've got the
     right spacecraft. I'll clue you, if it keeps
     going this way for 2 more days, we've got not
     only the right spacecraft, but we've got the
     best spacecraft.

[04:06:55:50]

[04:06:58:41]
CC: Roger. I need a Pop Romeo Dog on all three
     and a status report on the LMP.

[04:06:59:01]
LMP: Roger. The LMP's PRD hasn't moved an inch
     since we took off. And that's the one the
     CMP did have, still 0.64. And I just had
     about 5-1/2 hours sleep, and I'm in the
     process of scarfing up a meal; and I've been
     drinking lots of water, feeling good, and
     that's about it.

[04:06:59:29]
CC: okay. And you got a PRD on the other two.

[04:06:59:32]
LMP: Yes. The CMP is ready to report. The CMP
     is reading 1.2 rem.

[04:06:59:41]
CDR: And the CDR: I got stuck with somebody else's,
     but mine reads now - my new one reads
     2.02 rem. I don't know if there is a message
     there or not.

[04:06:59:49]
LMP: He's starting to glow in the dark.

[04:06:59:55]
CC: Yes. You should have hung on to the one you
     had. It sounded a little bit better. I

     find out.

[04:07:00:51]

[04:07:08:48]
CMP: Roger. Just for information, would the
     perigee reading and NOUN 42 be such a big
     minus number for such a small burn. We are
     reading minus 03137 now.

[04:07:09:03]
CC: Roger. Understand; NOUN 42 perigee reads
     minus 03137. Over.

[04:07:09:12]
CMP: Roger. We are going to PROGRAM 30 after you
     give us the target load, and I didn't think
     there would be that much of a change for such a
     small burn.

[04:07:09:20]
CC: Roger. Stand by. We will check into it, Jim.

[04:07:17:01]
CC: Roger, Frank. We don't think there's any
     problem or any funnies in this perigee prediction
     of minus 03137. It's a Keplerian prediction,
     and it's not very accurate. Now we
     have taken your vector from the downlink and
     run it through a make-believe external DELTA-V
     maneuver down here, and we get precisely the
     correct answer. Over.

CMP: Roger. Understand that you figure just
     because of the conics solution that it comes
     up.

[04:07:17:40]
CC: That's affirmative. The Kepler solution is
     just pretty gross.

[04:07:17:47]
CMP: Okay. I was just kind of curious. I could
     see differences when we were talking about
     LOI burns, but this being such a short one,
     I thought it wouldn't be that much difference.
     I understand.

     rate. When you're in high bit rate, that's
     right.

[04:07:18:20]

     been monitoring your thruster firings, and
     they show what appears to be very normal damp
     activities. Over.

[04:07:42:59]

     and we're still showing some of your SCS
     switches not set up as per checklist; specifically,
     rate LOW, deadband MINIMUM, and your BMAG
     mode at attitude one, rate two.

[04:07:57:35]

[04:08:01:38]
CMP: Roger. We burned on time, 14 seconds, attitude
     nominal. Our residuals were plus 2 in VG<sub>X</sub>,
     minus 1 in VG<sub>Y</sub> nothing in VG<sub>Z</sub>. Our EMS stopped
     about 6.2 and continued counting after the burn.

[04:08:02:03]
CC: Roger. Understand 14 seconds, burn on time,
     nominal attitude, two-tenths X, one-tenth Y,
     and nothing minus one-tenth Y, and nothing Z;
     and you put 6.2 on the EMS, and it continued to
     count after the burn. Is that affirmative?

[04:08:02:22]
_page : 3
CMP: No. We put the burn - we put the burn DELTA-V
     in the EMS, and after the burn, it was still
     counting.

[04:08:02:31]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[04:08:02:32]
CMP: Still counting up.

[04:08:02:33]
CC: Understand.

[04:08:03:31]
CMP: Okay, Houston. We transferred the state vector
     to the LM slot.

[04:08:03:36]
CC: Roger, Jim. Thank you, and I still don't understand
     you on this EMS. Counted down from 5 to
     zero normally and then continued through zero in
     a negative way, and now it's reading minus 6.2?
     Is that affirmative?

[04:08:03:52]
CMP: Roger. That's right. It was counting up when
     we shut it off. Last time I saw it, it was
     6.9. Now Frank just put it on AUTO again with
     the DELTA-V function switch in DELTA-V, and it
     jumped six-tenths. Then he tried the second
     time, and it stayed at zero so we really don't
     know what the story is.

[04:08:04:16]
CC: Roger. Understand you.

[04:08:05:48]

     the networks count on having it on schedule?
     Over.

[04:08:07:44]

     much to do, but we'll perform for you.

[04:08:07:49]
CC: Okay. We have a bunch of filter experts standing
     by if you need any advice.

[04:08:07:55]
CDR: Well, we're just going to have to just do it
     inside today because there are no good shots
     of the moon or the earth; the sun's too darn
     bright.

[04:08:08:03]

[04:08:10:06]
CDR: Roger. On this EMS, when I put it in DELTA-V,
     it was reading zero; then I switched to AUTO.
     Sometimes it will count to 19 or 20 feet per
     second.. I guess that is what happened.

[04:08:10:17]
CC: Roger. Understand when you put it to AUTO, it
     maybe will keep counting up to as much as 19 to
     20 feet per second.

[04:08:10:27]
CDR: .Just when you put it to AUTO; it will start
     counting on some occasion, by itself.

[04:08:10:31]
CC: Understand.

[04:08:21:26]
CDR: Mike, we're ready when you are.

[04:08:21:28]

[04:08:22:46]
CC: Negative, Frank.

[04:08:23:19]
CDR: We don't seem to have much luck today, but don't
     call for a repairman yet. It may be our camera
     here.

[04:08:23:46]
CDR: Any results yet, Mike?

[04:08:23:49]
_page : 6
CC: Negative, Frank. It may be that it hasn't
     warmed up properly.

[04:08:23:56]
CDR: okay. We've had it on for a while. Are you
     getting our FM okay?

[04:08:24:04]
CC: Okay, Frank. There, we got it. It's coming in
     loud and clear. We look like we're looking at
     your hat and now the MDC.

[04:08:24:18]
CDR: Okay. Well, good afternoon. This is the
     Apollo 8 crew. And how is it focusing now,
     Houston?

[04:08:24:27]
CC: It's looking good. If you can hold the thing
     still, there's sort of a time delay. Any
     motion at all there ruins our picture.

[04:08:24:39]
CDR: Tell me if there is any difference in it now.

[04:08:24:42]
CC: It's looking good now.

[04:08:24:46]
CDR: Okay, fine.

[04:08:24:48]
CC: It looks like you're okay, but somebody else is
     upside down.

[04:08:24:54]
CDR: Okay. That's right. That's Jim Lovell. What
     we thought we'd do today was just show you a
     little bit about life inside Apollo 8. We've
     shown you the scenes of the moon, the scenes
     of the earth, and we thought we'd invite you
     into our home. It's been our home at least for
     4 days as you can see on the instrument panel.
     We mark off each day on the instrument panel.
     We're four down, and we're working on the
     fifth day. Of course, we're all looking forward
     to the landing on Friday. Down here in the part
     of the spacecraft that we call the lower equipment
     bay, we have the President's adviser on
     physical fitness, Captain Jim Lovell, about to
     undergo an exercise program that we do every
     day. You notice that he floats around very
     freely. He just bumped his head on the optics,
     used for our navigating. He's working with an
     exercise device that's designed to keep the
     muscles in shape. Now another very important
     function of our spacecraft is the computer,
     and I thought you might be interested in seeing
     what we have here, the displays that give us
     all the information about our burn, about navigating,
     gating, and about the velocity that we use
     during entry and retrofire on earth-orbital
     missions. You can see it's controlled by a
     DSKY, or similar to a typewriter keyboard,
     and the things that go in and out of that are
     absolutely miraculous. It's done a fantastic
     job for us, and Jim Lovell has done an excellent
     job operating it. Now another very important
     thing whether you're in space or the ground is
     eating, and I've asked Bill Anders to show you
     how we eat up here in the flight. Pardon the
     picture while we move around here and change
     cameras. The food that we use is all dehydrated;
     it comes prepackaged in vacuum-sealed bags. You
     notice that all Bill has to do to keep it in one
     place is let go of it. Except for the air currents
     in the spacecraft, it would stay perfectly
     still. He gets out his handy, dandy scissors
     and cuts the bag. The food is varied, generally
     pretty good. If that doesn't sound like a rousing
     endorsement, it isn't, but nevertheless, it's
     pretty good food. You can see that Bill is very
     clever. He does things swiftly. Actually, those
     food bags are stuck together because they've been
     vacuum packed in plastic.

[04:08:28:24]
_page : 8
CMP: What do you have today, Bill, for dinner?

[04:08:28:32]
LMP: Well, here we have some cocoa; should be good.
     I'll be adding about 5 ounces of hot water to
     that. These are little sugar cookies, some
     orange juice, corn chowder, chicken and gravy,
     and a little napkin to wipe your hands when
     you're done. I'll prepare some orange juice
     here.

[04:08:29:37]
CDR: Okay. You can see that he's taking his scissors
     and cutting the plastic end off a little nozzle
     that he's going to insert the water gun into.
     The water gun dispenses a half-ounce burst of
     water per click. Here we go; Bill has it in
     now, and the water is going in. I hope that
     you all had better Christmas dinners today than
     us, but nevertheless, we thought you might be
     interested in how we eat.

[04:08:30:51]
_page : 9
CC: Roger. I haven't heard any complaints down
     here, Frank. We'll bring you up to speed on
     your food when you get back.

[04:08:30:59]
CDR: Very good.

[04:08:31:01]
CC: Looks like a happy home you've got up there.

[04:08:31:04]
CDR: Ordinarily, we let these drinks settle for
     5 or 10 minutes, but Bill's going to drink it
     right now. Then, to get on with the program,
     he cuts open another flap, and you'll see a
     little tube comes out - -

[04:08:31:22]
CMP: This is not a commercial.

[04:08:31:36]
CDR: - - and he drinks his delicious orange drink.
     Maybe I should say he drinks his orange drink.
     He's usually not that fast. Bill is really in
     a hurry today. Well, that's what we eat. Now
     another very important part of the spacecraft
     is the navigation station or the optics panel.
     And we - just a minute; Bill wants to say something.

[04:08:32:04]
LMP: That's good; but not quite as good as good old
     California orange juice.

[04:08:32:09]
_page : 10
CDR: Bill's from Florida.

[04:08:32:12]
CDR: Okay. Now if you'll let me have the camera,
     Jim, I'll show the people where you do most of
     your work. Okay. Bill, can you explain it?

[04:08:32:25]
CMP: If I can clean up some of Bill's food around
     here, and have it away - Down in this area is
     called the LEB or the lower equipment bay,
     and we have our optics positioning equipment
     right here. We do all our navigation down here
     by sighting on stars and on horizons of either
     the moon or the earth. And this is where we
     find out exactly where we are in space, what
     direction, and how fast we are traveling. And
     our computer, as Frank has mentioned, takes
     information and tells us how to maneuver to
     get home safely. I work with the scanning
     telescope and the sextant, and occasionally, if
     I get too busy, I just sort of float out of sight
     and go up into the tunnel which is the tunnel to
     the hatch of the lunar module which we don't
     have onboard, of course.

[04:08:33:35]
CDR: Now that's about all we have for today. I -
     each and every one of us wish each and every
     one of you a very Merry Christmas. And, I
     guess we'll see you tomorrow, and we'll be
     landing early Friday morning. Merry Christmas
     from Apollo 8.
     CC Roger. Merry Christmas from the ground, Apollo 8,
     and thank you very much for the guided tour. We
     really enjoyed it.

CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:09:10:23]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.

[04:09:10:28]
CDR: Roger. We've got an awful lot of these stars
     to mark on now, Mike, and they were having some
     concern about the PTC. Will you let us know if
     we stay in one position too long, or if we have
     to knock off and do some PTC?

[04:09:10:42]
CC: Will do, Frank.

[04:09:10:45]
CDR: Thank you.

[04:09:12:46]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We are monitoring your
     temperatures. The quads all look good. We
     will continue to do so, and we expect no difficulty
     with them during the P23 work.

[04:09:12:59]
CDR: Thank you.

[04:09:13:12]
CDR: Our highest tank temperature now is C.

[04:09:13:17]
CC: Understand; C is the hot one.

[04:09:48:39]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[04:09:49:12]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.

[04:09:49:17]
LMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[04:09:49:20]
CC: Roger, Bill. We would like to talk about your
     high-gain antenna sometime when you get a minute.

[04:09:49:27]
LMP: Okay. Just a second, Mike.

[04:09:50:47]
LMP: About 5 minutes, Mike, we'll be done here.

[04:09:56:22]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. About the high-gain antenna.

[04:09:56:26]
_page : 2
CC: Okay, Bill. We think it would be an extremely
     worthwhile thing to find out how it operates
     in the AUTO REACQ mode, and we propose running
     a test on it in that mode from 109 to 111 hours
     GET. Over.

[04:09:56:46]
LMP: Okay. We'll do that.

[04:09:56:48]
CC: Okay. I have about a - -

[04:09:56:50]
LMP: We'll try it on the way out.

[04:09:56:58]
CC: We have a detailed procedure which we can read
     up to you anytime you're ready.

[04:09:57:07]
LMP: Go ahead.

[04:09:57:10]
CC: Okay. We suggest the start time 109 hours GET,
     stop time 111 hours, and you'll be in a PTC.
     We're requesting a left roll rate, which we
     notice that you've been preferring, a left
     roll rate of 1 revolution per hour, and this
     is in your present PTC attitude (i.e., pitch
     10 degrees, 010 degrees, and yaw 45 degrees).
     The procedure is this: step 1, stop at roll
     angle 150 degrees; acquire - this is step 2 -
     acquire in MANUAL mode; three, switch to AUTO
     NARROW BEAM; four, make sure tracking in AUTO
     mode then switch to AUTO REACQ mode; five, position
     the high-gain antenna - -

[04:09:58:17]
CMP: Wait a minute, Houston.

[04:09:58:19]
CMP: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

[04:09:58:21]
CC: Okay. Whoa, whoa. Standing by.

[04:09:58:23]
_page : 3
LMP: I'm still starting.

[04:09:58:30]
LMP: Okay. Make sure tracking in AUTO and then what?

[04:09:58:34]
CC: Make sure tracking in AUTO, and then switch to
     AUTO REACQ mode. Over.

[04:09:58:46]
LMP: Okay. Will do.

[04:09:58:48]
CC: Okay. Step 5, position high-gain antenna
     pitch and yaw control to predicted earth's
     rise angles, and those angles are yaw 50 degrees,
     pitch minus 40 degrees. Over.

[04:09:59:18]
LMP: Okay.

[04:09:59:19]
CC: Okay. Two more steps. Step 6, remain on high-gain
     antenna in this mode for two REV's. Do not
     switch to OMNI anytime during these two REV's,
     and maintain mode configuration of voice and
     data. We expect loss of track should be no
     more than 15 minutes per REV. Over.

[04:09:59:51]
LMP: Roger.

[04:09:59:53]
CC: And the final step, 7, if any problem arises,
     go back to your initial gimbal angles of
     10 degrees pitch, 45 degrees yaw, and 150 degrees
     roll; reacquire and go to AUTO mode. Over.

[04:10:00:18]
LMP: Yes, I guess there ought to be a step 4A which
     says start roll again, right?

[04:10:00:23]
CC: That's affirmative. Excuse me there, that's
     affirmative.

[04:10:00:38]
LMP: Okay. If - let's see, if we - I don't understand
     your last comment. If we get into a
     problem, you want us to go back to 150 degrees
     roll?

[04:10:00:50]
_page : 4
CC: Well, all we want you to do is go ahead and
     reacquire in the AUTO mode, Bill. And it looks
     like that would be one way of doing it. But all
     we're saying is, you know, if you want to talk
     to us about something, or you have my other
     problems, or you don't like the way it looks,
     anything at all, just go ahead and reacquire
     in the AUTO mode.

[04:10:01:10]
LMP: Yes, why don't we just say if we do have problems,
     it doesn't pick it up when it's supposed
     to, give it a good try, and then call you up
     on the OMNI's or position ourselves and we'll
     talk about it and try for another two REV's,.

[04:10:01:21]
CC: That's just fine, Bill.

[04:10:01:29]
LMP: Okay. It's worked. We tried it once or twice
     on the way out, but the one modification is
     once it did break lock, and go to its MANUAL
     position, but I switched to the OMNI's in
     between. That sounds fine.

[04:10:01:45]
CC: Bill, could you run through that again? We're
     not reading you too loud, and would you say
     again what you tried on the way out, please.

[04:10:01:55]
LMP: On the way out, they gave us some REACQ angles
     which we used, and once it broke lock and re-positioned
     itself, why, it went over to the OMNI's
     and waited till we got to near breaking lock
     again and switched back and snapped right in
     there.

[04:10:02:20]
_page : 5
CC: Roger. Thank you. We copy.

[04:10:02:28]
LMP: We have a few more stars to get, and then we'll
     give it a try.

[04:10:02:33]
CC: Roger.

[04:10:23:15]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[04:10:23:20]
LMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[04:10:23:22]
CC: Roger, Bill. We got a bunch of tapes of some
     of your favorite music down here. You be
     interested in hearing a little background on the
     S-band?

[04:10:23:32]
LMP: Go ahead.

[04:10:23:35]
CC: Okay.

[04:10:27:22]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[04:10:27:24]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.

[04:10:27:28]
CMP: Roger. For some reason, we suddenly got a
     PROGRAM 01 and no attitude light on our computer.

[04:10:27:35]
CC: We confirm that.

[04:10:27:51]
CC: Stand by one, Jim. We're working on a procedure
     for getting you cranked back up again.

[04:10:27:57]
CMP: Okay.

[04:10:30:04]
CC: okay. Jim, while we're working on this procedure,
     we'd like to know did you select 01,
     and you get a VERB 37 ENTER, 01 ENTER?

[04:10:30:15]
CMP: Let's see, I'm not too sure, Mike. I might
     have done that, yes.

[04:10:30:20]
CC: okay.

[04:10:30:21]
CMP: We have star 01 coming up, now that might have
     been the reason.

[04:10:30:25]
CC: Okay. We understand. Why don't you just hold
     what you've got on your DSKY, and we'll be with
     you shortly.

[04:10:30:29]
CMP: okay.

[04:10:32:29]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:10:32:33]
CMP: Go ahead.

[04:10:32:34]
CC: Roger. Could you or Bill give us a better OMNI
     antenna, please?

[04:10:32:42]
CMP: Stand by.

[04:10:37:53]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[04:10:37:56]
CDR: GO ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[04:10:37:58]
CC: okay. Frank, our procedure is to select P00,
     and from P00 go to P51, and get a platform
     alignment. After you've done that, we will
     send you up a P27, a REFSMMAT, and then you
     can do P52 REFSMMAT options. Then you'll be
     back in business. Over.

[04:10:38:21]
_page : 2
CDR: Okay, Mike. Thank you.

[04:10:38:22]

[04:10:48:15]

[04:10:48:24]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. Say again. Over.

[04:10:48:29]
CDR: Okay. We've completed a P51 now. You want
     us to try a P52, or you want us to wait
     till we can put a REFSMMAT in?

[04:10:48:39]
CC: Stand by one, will you, please, Frank?

[04:10:48:43]
CDR: Roger.

[04:10:48:50]
CC: We're putting together a P27 load for you now,
     Frank; that's the reason for the delay. We
     just want to make sure we don't overlook anything
     before we send it up to you.

[04:10:49:02]
CDR: Okay. We'll just sit tight then. We've got
     a good P51. We'll just wait till you put in
     a REFSMMAT, and then, of course, we'll fine
     align over to that, right?

[04:10:49:14]
CC: That's right, that's exactly right. Just stand
     by 

[04:10:49:45]
CDR: Mike, this is Frank again.

[04:10:49:47]
CC: Go ahead.

[04:10:49:50]
CDR: I suggest that we go ahead while you're doing
     that, do a P52 here; and let it do an automatic
     and just tweak this up. Jim had to use Rigel
     and Sirius, and they're pretty close together.
     And although we got a zero difference for the
     star angle, that might not be a bad idea just
     to try a 52 here.

[04:10:50:08]
_page : 30
CC: We'd rather not do that, Frank. Stand by one.

[04:10:50:14]
CDR: Alright. We won't do a thing.

[04:10:50:47]
CC: Frank, we feel that procedure that you're talking
     about is really not required, and it's sort
     of wasting your time. You'd still have to - 
     upon completion of that, we'd have to send you
     a new REFSMMAT, and you'd have to go ahead and
     do P52 to that REFSMMAT in addition. Over.

[04:10:51:07]
CDR: We understand that. Go ahead. We'll wait for
     your REFSMMAT.

[04:10:51:09]
CC: Okay. Thank you.

[04:10:52:11]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. If you'd go P00 and ACCEPT,
     we have our P27 ready. We'll send you up a
     REFSMMAT. Over.

[04:10:52:20]
CDR: Roger. P00 and ACCEPT.

[04:10:52:23]
CC: Roger.

[04:10:53:15]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Frank, we'd like to make
     sure you understand that when you do your P52,
     you want to select option 1, the preferred
     option, because those are the registers we're
     blinking now with this P27.

[04:10:53:31]
CDR: Roger. Option 1; thank you.

[04:10:55:08]
_page : 4
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We got a good load in; it's
     your computer. Go to BLOCK.

[04:10:55:16]
CMP: Okay.

[04:10:55:17]
CDR: Roger. stand by.

[04:10:55:19]
CC: And you can go ahead with your P52 at your convenience.

[04:10:55:24]
CDR: We're going ahead right now.

[04:10:58:47]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[04:10:58:49]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[04:10:58:50]
CC: Roger. When Jim gets to the end of P52, he's
     got a flashing VERB 37. We'd like him to not
     proceed, to hold at that point; we'd like to
     read some bits and pieces out of the computer
     at that time. Over.

[04:10:59:10]
CDR: Roger.

[04:10:59:20]
CC: Apollo 8, if Anders has got time to give us a
     countdown, could we get the BIOMED switch from
     center to left?

[04:10:59:33]
LMP: Two, one -

[04:10:59:34]
LMP: MARK.

[04:10:59:38]
CC: Did you take that 1.7-second time delay into
     account?

[04:10:59:44]
LMP: Sorry about that.

[04:11:00:38]
CMP: Okay. Houston, you have it.

[04:11:00:49]
CC: Thank you, Jim. And I'll give you at estimate
     here on how long we want to hold at this point;
     it won't be too much longer.

[04:11:00:58]
_page : 5
CMP: Roger. It was my goof: I must have put in
     3701 instead of 3723 and 501.

[04:11:01:11]
CC: Roger.

[04:11:03:04]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We have got a flight plan
     suggestion for you.

[04:11:03:11]
CDR: Go ahead.

[04:11:03:13]
CC: Go ahead and delete the remainder of the P23's
     that you're working on now, go back to PTC attitude,
     and then pick up where it says 108 hours
     in the flight plan to pick up again there with
     your P23, or if you prefer to slip that time
     a couple of hours, if you want to get some
     rest in between.

[04:11:03:37]
CDR: I think that's a good idea; we'll do that.

[04:11:03:40]
CC: Okay.

[04:11:03:59]
CMP: Mike, what does this do to our state vector?

[04:11:04:02]
CC: Not a thing. We've looked at your state vector,
     and it's good.

[04:11:04:08]
CMP: So we didn't lose all the NAV we had just accomplished,
     right?

[04:11:04:16]
CC: Stand by one on that, Jim. I don't know; I'm
     checking.

[04:11:05:44]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:11:05:49]
CMP: Go ahead.

[04:11:05:51]
CC: Roger. I say again, your state vector is just
     fine; it's still ticky-poo, and the reason we're
     holding here is that we're checking to see if
     any P23 information was lost. That's reason one,
     and the second reason is that your W-matrix shares
     some computer memory cells with P01, and we are
     getting a clarification on the status of your
     W-matrix before we proceed. Over.

[04:11:06:22]
_page : 6
CMP: Roger, Michael.

[04:11:06:53]
CDR: We'll go ahead and start heading over to the
     PTC attitude.

[04:11:06:57]
CC: Very good.

[04:11:07:57]
CDR: Do you need that high gain any more, Mike?

[04:11:08:07]
CC: Negative. We don't need it any more.

[04:11:18:51]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:11:18:56]
CC: Roger, Frank. We're coming up on time for an
     oxygen purge on all three fuel cells. It
     might be a good time to do it while we are
     waiting here.

[04:11:19:04]
CDR: Fine.

[04:11:19:31]
CDR: Alright. Mike, we are going to purge the
     three fuel cells, oxygen only.

[04:11:19:35]
CC: That's correct. Thank you.

[04:11:23:44]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. That's enough on fuel
     cell number 1; if you'd start on two please.

[04:11:23:51]
CDR: Roger.

[04:11:32:22]
_page : 7
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We're in low bit rate now.
     Last time we saw you, you were still purging.
     Over.

[04:11:32:31]
CMP: Roger. ...

[04:11:32:35]
CC: You're unreadable, but request that you end
     your purge.

[04:11:32:42]
CMP: Roger. We ended our purge.

[04:11:32:45]
CC: Thank you.

[04:11:38:37]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[04:11:38:42]
CMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[04:11:38:44]
CC: Roger, Jim. I've got a short procedure I would
     like to read up to you on your DSKY, and I'd
     like to explain what it is. Your W-matrix
     shared some memory locations with P01; therefore,
     the W-matrix that you have right now is
     not a good one, and we would not want you to
     continue your P23 sightings with that matrix.
     So the procedure I'm going to give you is
     going to cause the matrix to reinitialize itself
     prior to your next P23, when you go into P23.
     And this will put you back with the value of the
     W-matrix which you loaded after TEI, you remember,
     that 3303 thing. And if this has any further
     effects on the flight plan, we're in the process
     of sorting that out, and if need be, we'll send
     you up a revised sighting schedule later, both
     with the COMM and loss of COMM case. Over.

[04:11:39:53]
_page : 8
CMP: Okay. Stand by, and I'll get something to
     copy with.

[04:11:39:57]
CC: Okay.

[04:11:40:09]
CMP: Okay. Go ahead.

[04:11:40:11]
CC: Okay. Insert without releasing the flashing
     VERB 37 the following: VERB 25 NOUN 07 ENTER,
     77 ENTER, 40 ENTER, ENTER, VERB 37 ENTER,
     00 ENTER. Over.

[04:11:40:49]
CMP: Understand. We insert VERB 37 without releasing,
     is that correct?

[04:11:40:56]
CC: Roger. You should have flashing 37 on your DSKY
     now, and without releasing that flashing 37, go
     ahead with the VERB 25, et cetera.

[04:11:41:08]
CMP: Roger. Okay. I see what you mean. Okay. We'll
     insert VERB 25, NOUN 07 ENTER, 77 ENTER, 40 ENTER,
     ENTER, reinsert VERB 37 ENTER, 00 ENTER.

[04:11:41:24]
CC: That's all correct. Say, if you've got any
     questions about that, we would be happy to
     answer them.

[04:11:41:35]
CMP: Roger. Are we cleared to do that now?

[04:11:41:37]
CC: That's affirmative, Jim.

[04:11:41:39]
CMP: Roger.

[04:11:42:29]
CDR: Hey, Mike, this is Frank.

[04:11:42:32]
CC: Go ahead, Frank.

[04:11:42:36]
CDR: Is there any danger that this might have screwed
     up any other part of memory that would be involved
     with entry or anything like that?

[04:11:42:53]
_page : 9
CC: Frank, all indications are that there is
     absolutely no problem with anything in the
     computer memory other than the W-matrix. However,
     we are continuing to look at it, and if
     there is any doubt in our mind, we will ask you
     to dump the memory locations for us later. Over.

[04:11:43:15]
CDR: Okay. Fine.

[04:11:56:41]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:11:56:45]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[04:11:56:47]
CC: Roger, Jim. We thought you might be interested
     in knowing, based on 2-1/2 hours worth of track
     after your last midcourse, and looking ahead,
     we're predicting the midcourse correction at
     122 hours will be less than 1 foot per second.
     And keep it on going to entry interface minus
     2 hours, we're predicting 2 foot per second
     midcourse at that time. Now those numbers will
     be refined; we'll get about another 8 hours of
     track on you before we amend them. Over.

[04:11:57:21]
CMP: Sounds like we're on pretty good trajectory.

[04:11:57:25]
CC: Can't hardly beat it.

[04:11:57:33]
CMP: After we do these next P23's, I'll see what our
     P37 gives us. What's that midcourse, 122 hours
     that has practically zero?

[04:11:57:44]
CC: Yes. It's looking to be less than 1 foot per
     second, about four-tenths of a foot per second
     right now. And then the one before entry, at
     2 hours before entry interface, is looking to
     be about 2 feet per second.

[04:11:58:00]
_page : 10
CMP: Roger. Well, okay. I'll run a P37, and we
     can just compare the difference.

LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. Over.

[04:12:08:50]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[04:12:08:53]
LMP: Roger. Got the JOD back on watch again. We
     want to make sure we don't overdo the star sightings
     at the expense of thermal control, so you
     might keep an eye on us and give us a NO-GO if
     we start getting too hot on one side.

[04:12:09:09]
CC: Roger. Will do, Bill. Has Jim gone to bed?

[04:12:09:18]
CMP: No, I'm right here. We're going to start doing
     cislunar NAV right now, and Bill's up in the
     left-hand seat.

[04:12:09:28]
CC: Roger. Understand; you're going to do some P23's
     now. We thought you were going to take a rest
     and do them later.

[04:12:09:38]
CMP: No, Frank is asleep now. We'll get these out
     of the way. So I'm coming over to do a trunnion
     alignment at this time, and then we'll go into
     the P23.

[04:12:09:56]
CC: Okay, Jim. There's one thing before you get
     started on the P23. What we told you before,
     we still think is absolutely correct. The only
     thing in the computer memory that is changed by
     that P02 is the W-matrix. However, as an additional
     precaution, we'd like to dump the computer
     memory and go through it and check it bit
     by bit and make sure everything is exactly
     copasetic. Over.

[04:12:10:31]
_page : 2
LMP: okay. Do you want to do that now?

[04:12:10:34]
CC: Affirmative. We're getting Goldstone configured
     for it; it'll be just a minute. And while we're
     doing that, I can read you this procedure if
     you're ready to copy.

[04:12:10:43]
CMP: Okay. Stand by one, and I'll be ready to copy
     pretty soon.

[04:12:10:47]
CC: Thank you.

[04:12:11:01]
CMP: Go ahead.

[04:12:11:03]
CC: Okay. We'd like a VERB 01 NOUN 01 ENTER, 333
     ENTER, and then we'd like for you to read us
     register 1. Register 1 we expect will be a
     10 000, and if register 1 is equal to that, then
     what that means is that the computer will dump
     its erasable memory twice. That's 10 000 numbers,
     twice number for the erasable memory dump. If
     it's not reading 10 000, then we'll ask you to
     make it read 10 000 by going VERB 21 NOUN 01
     ENTER, 333 ENTER, 10 000 ENTER. After you've
     done that, the dump VERB is VERB 74 ENTER, and
     that will automatically dump the total erasable
     memory twice, and return you to the proper configuration.

[04:12:12:13]
CMP: okay. The procedure will be VERB 01 NOUN 01
     ENTER, 333 ENTER, and read out register 1. Then
     10 000 - the memory - the computer will then dump
     the memory twice as properly configured. If not,
     we have to load in 10 000, and we do that by going
     VERB 21 NOUN 01 ENTER, 333 ENTER, 10 000 ENTER,
     and VERB 74 ENTER. Now if register 1 does read
     10 000, then we'll still have to do the VERB 74
     ENTER, is that correct?

[04:12:12:49]
_page : 3
CC: That's affirmative. That VERB 74 ENTER is what
     starts the dump. Then we just prior to that want
     to make sure we got 10 000; we made sure. And just
     hang loose one on Goldstone down here; we're getting
     it configured.

[04:12:13:10]
CMP: Roger. You need the high gain, Mike?

[04:12:13:13]
CC: Negative. We won't need the high gain.

[04:12:15:21]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Goldstone is all ready, and
     you can go ahead with that procedure, Jim.

[04:12:15:28]
CMP: Roger.

[04:12:15:55]
CMP: Okay. Register 1 reads 10 000.

[04:12:15:58]
CC: Okay. Thank you.

[04:12:16:07]
CMP: And do you want VERB 74 now?

[04:12:16:09]
CC: That's fine.

[04:12:17:59]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:12:18:03]
CMP: Go ahead.

[04:12:18:04]
CC: Roger. Have you done the VERB 74 ENTER yet?

[04:12:18:07]
CMP: No, I'm waiting for your command.

[04:12:18:10]
CC: Okay. I'm sorry; you must have missed it. You
     can go ahead right now, Jim; we're all set.

[04:12:18:17]
_page : 4
CMP: Roger. VERB 74.

[04:12:18:23]
CMP: On its way down.

[04:12:18:25]
CC: Thank you.

[04:12:20:18]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Jim, the dump is complete.
     You can go ahead and do whatever you like with
     your computer now.

[04:12:20:26]
CMP: Roger.

[04:12:20:34]
LMP: We're going to be restricted to P23 for a while.

[04:12:20:38]
CC: Just don't let Anders touch the computer.

[04:12:20:45]
LMP: I haven't yet, and I don't plan to.

[04:12:20:50]
CC: Roger. We concur with that decision.

[04:12:22:17]
CC: Oh, we've just been honored by the presence of
     Mr. Neil Armstrong who is now standing by the
     CAP COM console, alert and eager.

[04:12:22:28]
CMP: Roger. Ask him how the stock market is doing.

[04:12:22:31]
CC: Tears are rolling down his face.

[04:12:26:25]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston..

[04:12:26:29]
LMP: Go ahead.

[04:12:26:31]
CC: With the computer, we sort of got behind in our
     promise of music. Do you still want it?

[04:12:26:38]
LMP: Go ahead.

[04:12:26:41]
CC: Okay.

[04:12:26:44]
LMP: Just so Neil doesn't accompany it.

[04:12:27:00]
CC: ... choir.

[04:12:27:09]
CC: Neil says you're in luck; he has a cold today.

[04:12:32:09]
_page : 5
LMP: Must be the wrong speed.

[04:12:33:01]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[04:12:33:21]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[04:12:33:25]
LMP: Roger, Mike. That's real nice, but if you don't
     mind, you'd better hold it off until we get this
     tracking test done. ...

[04:12:33:45]
CC: Roger, Bill. We concur.

[04:12:33:54]
LMP: Sounds like it is being run at the wrong speed.

[04:12:33:58]
CC: It doesn't sound very good to us either.

[04:12:34:02]
LMP: Coming through nicely, though, Mike. You're
     coming through nicely, Mike; maybe you could
     just sing a little bit.

[04:12:34:10]
CC: Yes, I'll get my harmonica.

[04:12:56:36]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[04:12:56:39]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[04:12:56:42]
LMP: Roger, Mike. How are our temperatures looking
     across the service module? Could it be GO here
     for a shoot in another couple sets on this next
     start?

[04:12:56:53]
CC: Yes. I'm monitoring them, and they look real
     good to me, Bill. Just a second and I will check
     with the experts. Yes, you are just fine, Bill,
     on your quad temps.

[04:12:57:08]
LMP: And SPS is okay?

[04:12:57:13]
CC: Affirmative. SPS is looking good also.

[04:12:57:19]
LMP: Okay.

[04:12:57:28]
_page : 6
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:12:57:32]
LMP: Go ahead, Mike.

[04:12:57:34]
CC: Roger, Bill. Because of this W-matrix thing,
     we would like to add some more star sightings
     when Jim gets through with the series that he
     is currently on. And I have the information
     relevant to them when you are ready to copy.

[04:12:57:53]
LMP: Stand by.

[04:12:58:00]
LMP: Go ahead.

[04:12:58:02]
CC: Okay. This is - we would like him to do them,
     as I say, whenever he is through the series he
     is on now, and they are the same ones that are
     printed on your flight plan page 2-86. The
     first one we'd like to increase to two sets;
     the second one we'd like to increase to two
     sets, making a total of five sets on those stars
     on page 2-86. Do you copy?

[04:12:58:34]
LMP: Roger.

[04:12:58:44]
CC: Okay. The other change is on an elapsed time
     of 120 - a hundred and twenty hours: we'd like
     to increase that P23 work, the first star change,
     from one set to two sets. The second star from
     one to two - -

[04:12:59:07]
LMP: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

[04:12:59:08]
CC: Okay.

[04:12:59:12]
LMP: Okay. Looking for the page; I got it now.

[04:12:59:16]
_page : 7
CC: okay. The first star, make two sets; second
     star, two sets; for a total of five sets.

[04:12:59:25]
LMP: Okay.

[04:12:59:27]
CC: And if you're in a copying mood, I have - would
     you believe - a couple of changes to your entry
     checklist which I'd like to read up to you
     sometime today or tomorrow.

[04:12:59:43]
LMP: okay. Why don't we get them here after this
     one set of stars.

[04:12:59:46]
CC: Very good.

[04:13:00:01]
CC: Roger, Bill. I was just given a new one here.
     While you've got your flight plan out, this
     would be 130 hours GET. Have you got that page?

[04:13:00:15]
LMP: I just put it away, but I'll get it out again.

[04:13:00:17]
CC: I'm sorry about that.

[04:13:00:24]
LMP: ... if you want me.

[04:13:00:33]
CC: Roger. At 130 hours GET, star 02: Where it is
     printed two sets, we'd like to make that only
     one set; and then we would like to add star 11
     (star one - one) lunar far horizon, two sets.
     Over.

[04:13:01:05]
LMP: okay.

[04:13:01:08]
CMP: Hey, Mike. Is MIT slipping in the back door?

[04:13:01:14]
CC: Not really, Jim. It has to do with this W-matrix.
     You remember that we reinitialized it in lunar
     orbit, and then we worked on it as you came back
     on the previous sightings you made, and now
     we've gone and reinitialized it again at this
     point. And we'd like to restore it to its
     former size and shape and whatnot.

[04:13:01:40]
_page : 8
CMP: Okay. I understand.

[04:13:12:12]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[04:13:12:15]
CC: Go ahead, Jim.

[04:13:12:20]
CMP: Mike, I have got the entry checklist right now.
     You want to give me an update?

[04:13:12:24]
CC: Okay, Bill. Thank you. The first one is on
     page E-7.

[04:13:12:32]
LMP: Okay. Stand by.

[04:13:13:08]
LMP: Okay, Mike. Ready to go. Now I know why Neil
     was over there.

[04:13:13:14]
CC: No. You can't blame it on him. Page E-7 under
     CM RCS preheat, halfway down where it says "UP
     TELEMETRY BLOCK" - Are you with me?

[04:13:13:31]
LMP: I am with you.

[04:13:13:33]
CC: Okay. After UP TELEMETRY BLOCK, insert "RCS
     CM heaters circuit breakers to CLOSE."

[04:13:13:58]
LMP: Okay.

[04:13:14:00]
CC: All they are doing there is just making sure
     you get your heater circuit breakers closed.
     The next one is on page E-9.

[04:13:14:25]
LMP: Ready to copy.

[04:13:14:27]
CC: Roger. On E-9 up near the top under "terminate
     CM RCS preheat" and the middle there, after
     "CM RCS heaters OFF, LMP confirm," insert "RCS
     CM heaters circuit breakers to OPEN." That's
     just opening those two breakers back up.

[04:13:14:54]
_page : 9
LMP: Roger.

[04:13:14:56]
CC: And the last change is on page 14.

[04:13:15:20]
LMP: Okay.

[04:13:15:22]
CC: Yes. This one should be a favorite of yours.
     Near the top where it says "tape recorder,
     RECORD FORWARD"- Are you with me?

[04:13:15:35]
LMP: Roger.

[04:13:15:36]
CC: Insert between "tape recorder" and "RECORD
     FORWARD," insert "COMMAND RESET high bit rate."
     Over.

[04:13:16:08]
LMP: Okay. We got them.

[04:13:16:10]
CC: Thank you, Bill. That's all.

[04:13:16:14]
LMP: Okay, Michael.

[04:13:16:24]
CC: How is it going? Do you want any systems dope?

[04:13:16:29]
LMP: Yes, they are hanging together. I haven't even
     looked at them for the last half hour. I have
     been over here in the sun.

[04:13:16:35]
CC: Yes, they sure are, Bill. They can get you any
     specific numbers, whatnot, if you're interested.

[04:13:16:50]
LMP: Well, I hate to say I wasn't interested, but I
     don't need any specific numbers right now.

[04:13:16:56]
CC: Okay. Very good. We concur.

[04:13:17:03]
CC: That's an outer space first.

[04:13:17:10]
_page : 10
LMP: On second thought, how's the evaporator outlet
     TEMP doing?

[04:13:17:25]
CC: Forty-six degrees, Bill.

[04:13:17:31]
LMP: Cancel that outer space first.

[04:13:17:35]
CC: Roger.

[04:13:17:49]
CC: How's Magellan coming along?

[04:13:17:55]
CMP: I am getting a crossed eye looking at this thing.
     Hey, Mike, just as a matter of interest, I have
     been just looking at the earth the last hour and
     a half and there are two tremendous storms down
     there. I am not sure just where they are, but
     the vortices are huge.

[04:13:18:14]
CC: Roger. Understand.

[04:13:18:15]
LMP: That's your first space weather report at the
     manned weather forecast from space, and he's
     not so sure where it's raining, but it is raining
     somewhere.

[04:13:18:26]
CC: Roger - -

[04:13:18:27]
LMP: I'd also like to point out that Magellan is not
     a good analogy. I would also like to point out
     that Magellan is not a good analogy. I don't
     think he made it around.

[04:13:18:36]
CC: Very good.

[04:13:18:39]
CMP: How about Alford Chitister?

[04:13:18:44]
CC: Roger. Alf.

[04:13:19:27]
CC: I don't know how much detail you can see, Jim,
     but your subspacecraft point is out in the
     middle of the Pacific Ocean about halfway between
     Australia and South America.

[04:13:19:45]
_page : 11
CMP: Roger. The next time I take a look, I'll see
     what I - we are maneuver to the moon now. We'll
     see if we can see our shadow.

[04:13:20:06]
LMP: Seriously, has anyone been able to see the spacecraft
     from earth? Optically?

[04:13:20:18]
CC: We don't think so, Bill. We haven't been able to
     confirm that they have.

[04:13:20:26]
LMP: Okay.

[04:13:20:33]
CC: You are coming right down the center line of the
     airways. If you see the airliners going the other
     way, you better move over.

[04:13:20:42]
LMP: That's the first time old Lovell's been on track
     for a long time.

[04:13:20:48]
CC: Roger.

[04:13:20:53]
LMP: Mike, an interesting viewpoint of the NAV sightings:
     maneuvering with the minimum impulse controller
     on the way home is a lot more difficult
     than going out because of all the fuel we don't
     have now. Every little pulse really moves the
     spacecraft around.

[04:13:21:08]
CC: Roger. Understand. You have too much control for
     you.

[04:13:21:14]
LMP: Now, yes.

[04:13:21:19]
CC: Let Bruce beware.

[04:13:23:48]

CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:13:23:52]
CMP: Go ahead.

[04:13:23:54]
CC: Howdy, Jim. Dick Underwood is over here. They're
     getting their film processing all prepared for your
     film when you get back and tentatively, can you
     give us some idea of how much you exposed?

[04:13:24:08]
CMP: Let me - - let me introduce you to the great film
     man. He will tell you all about it.

[04:13:24:12]
CC: Thank you.

[04:13:24:15]
LMP: Tell him I hope he can account for haze through
     the windows. We - on our departure from the moon,
     we tried to burn up as much as - much of what we
     had left over, which was quite a bit, and tell him
     I hope he can develop the high-speed film taken
     at normal film settings.

[04:13:24:47]
CC: Roger. Understand you used just about everything
     and a lot of the high speed; you used it to normal
     setting.

[04:13:24:56]
LMP: Roger. We got it in the wrong bucket there a
     couple of times.

[04:13:24:59]
CC: okay.

[04:13:25:06]
LMP: We never did have a chance to do any night earthshine
     stuff.

[04:13:25:14]
CC: Say again about the earthshine, Bill.

[04:13:25:18]
LMP: We never did have a chance to do any earthshine
     photography.

[04:13:56:00]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. How are you coming along
     with your P23 marks?

[04:13:56:06]
CMP: My eyeballs are getting square. That's what
     we have been doing most of the day, Ken. Are
     you receiving the data down below?

[04:13:56:20]
CC: Roger. Looks like you are getting some pretty
     good marks. We have a pretty good hack on the
     vector and the matrix, and looks like if you
     wanted to terminate at this point, that we
     do have good data.

[04:13:56:38]
CMP: Sounds good. I'll terminate after this - -

[04:13:56:41]

[04:14:16:10]
CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8.

[04:14:16:17]
LMP: Who is this, Ken or Jerry?

[04:14:16:20]
CC: Say again, please.

[04:14:16:24]
LMP: This Ken?

[04:14:16:29]
CC: Here's Ken. Go ahead.

[04:14:16:35]
_page : 2
LMP: Okay, Ken. We are getting back to the PTC
     attitude. Would you like us to do this high-gain
     REACQ test now on the first roll?

[04:14:16:42]
CC: Affirmative.

[04:14:16:55]
LMP: Okay. Look, how about if I just went to REACQ
     right now?

[04:14:17:28]
LMP: Matter of fact I'm in REACQ. If you want me to
     stay here, why we'll just press on.

[04:14:17:40]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. That is fine.

[04:14:17:44]
LMP: I guess this step about stopping in roll 150
     really doesn't matter too much then.

[04:14:18:10]
CC: That's right, Bill. That was just to let you
     acquire.

[04:14:18:17]
LMP: Man, we can acquire on the run here.

[04:14:18:21]
CC: Hey, you are getting good at that.

[04:14:18:25]
LMP: That's all they'll let me do.

[04:14:18:30]
LMP: Okay. We will keep it here for two REV's, Ken.
     and - Frank and Jim are asleep, and ...
     so I'll just keep it going here for two rolls.

[04:14:18:44]
CC: Okay. Real fine.

[04:14:35:59]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. Over.

[04:14:36:02]

LMP: Well, the REACQ didn't work as advertised. It
     looked like it went on by the scan limit and
     into the mechanical limit and followed MSFN
     around looking, out of the corner of its eye
     on WIDE BEAM. And when MSFN came back underneath
     the spacecraft, why it snapped back on
     it to NARROW BEAM. It apparently never broke
     lock; or if it did, it was only instantaneously.

[04:14:36:56]
_page : 3
CC: Roger. It looked like we did break lock there
     for about 8 minutes.

[04:14:37:05]
LMP: Well, we might have broken two way lock, but I
     was still having about AGC right at the noise
     level, at the minimum reception level.

[04:14:37:17]
CC: Roger.

[04:14:37:30]
LMP: When we get out here in the clear zone, when
     we're definitely out of the scan limit, why,
     I'll go ahead and go to the MANUAL and AUTO
     lock-on sequence and switch over to REACQ and
     see what it does next time around.

[04:14:37:43]
CC: Roger.

[04:14:38:06]
LMP: Houston. Were you able to get high bit rate
     from the OMNI's now, by the way?

[04:14:39:21]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. The OMNI high bit rate
     capability is noisy, but usable.

[04:14:39:31]
LMP: Okay. I think what we'll do here is, if I see
     the high gain definitely going past the scan
     limit before it gets the mechanical limit, I'll
     go ahead and ask - you could ask if the REACQ
     feature hasn't taken over I'll just go ahead
     and shut it down so that it'll remain in stops.

[04:14:40:00]
_page : 4
LMP: How's that sound?

[04:14:40:01]
CC: We are talking about it now, Bill.

[04:14:40:05]
LMP: Okay. It's my understanding that the scan
     warning limit of this thing is supposed to stop
     tracking; and break of lock, it'll travel on
     over to the thumb-wheel settings.

[04:14:40:28]
CC: Roger. That's my understanding, Bill. We are
     talking about it right now. I'll let you know
     in just a second.

[04:14:40:33]
LMP: Probably, Ken, we are not ever losing the earth's
     present signal.

[04:14:40:38]
CC: That's correct.

[04:14:42:01]
CC: Hey, Bill, can you tell us what angles this went
     through? The curve that we have plotted is
     apparently the RF limit rather than the mechanical
     limit; and discussing the function of the
     AUTO REACQ mode, it looks like it is supposed
     to shift when it hits the RF limit, which is
     your - should be your ENTER set of numbers
     as opposed to the scan warning limit. And if
     it went inside of that number, could you tell
     us about what kind of numbers it did go to?

[04:14:42:35]
LMP: Roger. It went past the caution warning limit
     to the scan or RF limit, as I understand it.
     And let me give you a rundown on what it did
     here.

[04:14:42:44]
_page : 5
CC: Okay. Say it slow so I can copy it.

[04:14:42:50]
LMP: Okay. The antenna went to about 330 to 270 yaw,
     plus 60 to 80 pitch. Copy?

[04:14:43:15]
CC: Roger.

[04:14:43:19]
LMP: Okay. The AGC dropped off to what I call our
     noise level, that was the voltage level on the
     AGC measured at - integrated when the noise
     broke in. It was about 11 o'clock position on
     the gage, and it looked like it was switching
     beam widths there off and on. It would pulse
     up and down, and a couple of times dropped to
     full-scale low very briefly.

[04:14:43:52]
CC: Okay. You got some marks on that AGC that
     should register in volts, I believe. Do you
     have an indication other than 11 o'clock?

[04:14:44:06]
LMP: Unfortunately, the numbers never got on here.
     If you will look on that chart that Fred Haise
     has, it shows one at 11 o'clock position which
     is the noise level. I don't remember what the
     voltage was. I might have it on my systems
     book, though.

[04:14:44:24]
CC: Bill, - -

[04:14:44:25]
LMP: When the antenna - when the antenna did snap
     back in, it went to yaw 60, pitch minus 5, with
     VERB 64 reading plus 67 for yaw and minus 10 for
     pitch.

[04:14:44:45]
_page : 6
CC: Okay. Yes, copy all that. I think you have
     four or five marks on that power meter, don't
     you? From what you are saying, I take it, it's
     between marks 2 and 4.

[04:14:45:01]
LMP: Yes. Stand by a second.

[04:14:45:15]
LMP: Stand by, Ken. I'll tell you what that mode is.

[04:14:45:18]
CC: Thank you.

[04:14:45:50]
LMP: Okay. It went to about - hovering around 2.4 to
     3 volts.

[04:14:45:57]
CC: Okay. Thank you.

[04:14:46:02]
LMP: Closer to 2.4.

[04:14:46:03]
CC: Roger.

[04:14:50:11]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:14:50:15]
LMP: Go ahead.

[04:14:50:19]
CC: Okay. It's not real clear that it did, in fact,
     get to the mechanical stop, and if it does, the
     back room people say we can stay up against that
     stop for a maximum of 15 minutes without doing
     any damage. And we would kind of like to track
     it through one more time as is. We do have the
     high bit rate capability on OMNI's. So we would
     like to follow through that same configuration for
     one more REV.

[04:14:50:55]
LMP: Stand by.

[04:14:51:08]
LMP: Well, since we are not sure that it did get up
     against the mechanical stop last time for
     10 minutes or so, I don't think it would be too
     smart to do it this time because we may end up
     having to switch field to high gain position.

[04:14:51:32]
_page : 7
CC: I am sorry, Bill. You didn't come through.
     Say again, please.

[04:14:51:38]
LMP: Since we are not - it is not clear to me that
     we weren't up against mechanical stops for a
     while on the last time around. That might
     account for 10 minutes of that 15 minutes, and
     there is no sense pushing our luck. I think
     we ought to - if it starts dropping off again,
     we just ought to go and put it back into MANUAL
     and take it back where it belongs. We are still
     a long way from home, and if that antenna switch
     fails, it's going to fail the high-gain position,
     and that's all we got.

[04:14:52:18]
CC: Roger, Bill. And we will be making a handoff
     on stations at 5:5.

[04:14:52:27]
LMP: Okay.

[04:14:53:39]
LMP: Ken, we are going to switch COMM carriers here a
     second.

[04:14:53:42]
CC: Okay, thank you.

[04:14:53:52]
LMP: Relay that. We'll hold this configuration for
     a while.

[04:14:53:55]
CC: okay.

[04:14:56:03]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston through Honeysuckle.

[04:14:56:10]
_page : 8
LMP: Roger. Read you five-by.

[04:14:56:12]
CC: Thank you.

[04:15:07:24]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. Over.

[04:15:07:27]
CC: Loud and clear, Apollo 8.

[04:15:07:32]
LMP: It did the same thing that time, Ken. This
     time the voltage AGC did drop to full-scale low
     for several seconds, but the antenna does seem
     to have the capabilities to look right through
     the spacecraft, and I guarantee, the earth went
     where the antenna was not supposed to be able
     to go. I

[04:15:07:53]
CC: okay. I would just like to confirm with you that
     it never did go back to the present numbers.

[04:15:08:02]
LMP: no, it apparently never lost earth presence signal.
     It sounds like it was trying to pick up
     one-way lock all the time, and we usually hovered
     around 2-volts AGC except for brief periods.

[04:15:08:17]
CC: Okay. Thank you very much.

[04:15:08:21]
LMP: It looks like if they had - should have not had
     the ... switch into WIDE BEAM until after it
     had gone to those preset limits.

[04:15:09:04]
LMP: We are back in AUTO on the OMNI.

[04:15:09:06]
CC: Okay. Thank you.

[04:15:12:59]
LMP: Houston, CDR is up and manning the helms. We
     are going to switch COMM carriers. We'll be
     off the air for a little bit.

[04:15:13:04]
_page : 9
CC: Okay. Thank you.

CDR: Hey, Ken. This is Frank.

[04:15:16:26]
CC: Good morning, sir.

[04:15:17:01]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[04:15:17:03]
CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8. Loud and clear.

[04:15:17:08]
CDR: How far are we from home, Ken?

[04:15:17:10]
CC: Oh, about 152, looks like. That's pretty gross;
     I get you a real number in just a minute.

[04:15:17:17]
CDR: 152?

[04:15:17:37]
CC: 148 550; that's a good number.

[04:15:17:44]
CDR: Very good.

[04:15:17:53]
CC: And your velocity is about 4650.

[04:15:18:07]
CDR: Increasing, huh?

[04:15:18:09]
CC: That's affirm.

[04:15:31:21]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[04:15:31:23]
CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8.

[04:15:31:26]
LMP: We are trying to get back on our normal sleep
     cycle, and I just woke up here a little while
     ago, so I'm going to try to hit the hay again.
     It'd probably be a good idea to try another
     Seconal to try to get with it. What do you guys
     think down there?

[04:15:31:46]
CC: okay. Sounds like a good idea, and if we can
     get Frank to tell us how much sack time he got,
     why that'll go in the log, too.

[04:15:32:04]
CDR: I was in bed for 7 hours, Ken, and I probably
     slept for about 4-1/2 to 5 hours of it, anyway.

[04:15:32:10]
_page : 2
CC: You're getting better. Good.

[04:15:32:53]
CDR: If you - if you're interested in further reports,
     we've all had three meals today, and we have
     drunk a lot of water, and Jim's asleep now. He
     worked pretty hard this afternoon, but I think
     we are all in pretty good shape now.

[04:15:33:06]
CC: Real fine. Thank you.

[04:15:33:11]
CDR: Used the exerciser.

[04:15:34:10]
CDR: Well, Ken, that just leaves you or I - how about
     you and I - did anything exciting happen today?

[04:15:34:16]
CC: I think you know about all the things that are
     exciting up on your end, and it's real quiet down
     here. Everybody is smiling; Santa was good to most
     of the folks in the world, and everything is pretty
     calm, like it should be on Christmas.

[04:15:34:35]
CDR: very good.

[04:15:34:42]
CC: Milt says we're in a period of relaxed vigilance.

[04:15:34:46]
CDR: Very good.

[04:15:34:51]
CDR: We'll relax; you be vigilant.

[04:15:34:54]
CC: That's a fair trade. (Laughter)

[04:15:37:24]
CDR: Hey, Ken, has anybody got any good idea why that
     quad A tank is running hot, hotter than the rest
     by so much?

[04:15:37:34]
CC: Okay. I didn't have an answer when I came on;
     just a second and we'll check again.

[04:15:39:44]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:15:39:49]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[04:15:39:52]
_page : 3
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. Let me tell you what the subjects
     are that we're going over down here: number
     one, we're making a review of all the entry
     procedures and this type of information, and we're
     going to actually go through and review the entry
     checklist. We have people that are still working
     on verification of your erasable memory, and we
     are looking at the EMS problem, and we're discussing
     the quad temperature, so I'll feed up some
     of these pieces of information as they come along,
     and right now we are just sort of having a status
     review.

[04:15:40:34]
CDR: I don't think the EMS is much of a problem; it
     just jumps when you go into AUTO. I don't believe
     it will bother us for entry. I - I'm doing the
     same thing; I am looking over my entry checklist.
     One of the first things I see here is a coldsoak,
     and I don't think we want to evaporate between the
     last midcourse and entry, do we?

[04:15:55:27]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:16:09:33]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:16:09:56]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:16:10:00]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[04:16:10:03]
CC: Roger. Looking at the flight plan, you have a P52
     coming up at a 115 hours, and we'll have to do
     another one at 119:45 in preparation for the P23.
     And it's acceptable with the ground procedures
     if you would like to delay about 115-hour alignment,
     and do it just once at 119:45, or you can
     do it there in flight plan location. If you want
     to skip the 115-hour alignment we could go ahead
     and start in on the pitch and yaw free PTC mode
     at this time.

[04:16:10:48]
_page : 4
CDR: What does that mean, Ken?

[04:16:10:54]
CC: Okay. We have a DTO that requires that we do a
     PTC and go ahead and do it in minimum impulse
     mode so that we're not putting any attitude hold
     corrections in. And we're going to be tracking
     the attitude excursion, and they want this some -
     think like 6 hours - or until we reach a limit.

[04:16:11:19]
CDR: okay.

[04:16:11:30]
CDR: Cabin's running a little bit warmer today than
     normal.

[04:16:11:35]
CC: I'm sorry; say it again.

[04:16:11:38]
CDR: I say the cabin is running a little bit hotter
     today than it has been. It looks like this particular
     PTC alignment gets more sun in the cabin than
     the PTC before.

[04:16:11:51]
CC: Roger. What kind of temperature are you recording now?

[04:16:11:56]
CDR: About 78.

[04:16:12:04]
CDR: I just put the window shades up. That'll cool
     it down.

[04:16:12:07]
_page : 5
_tape : 74
CC: Okay.

[04:16:12:12]
CDR: Do you want me to take the pitch yaw out of RATE COMMAND, right?

[04:16:12:20]
CC: That's affirmative. You just put it MINIMUM IMPULSE, and then we'll watch it.

[04:16:12:34]
CDR: There you are.

[04:16:12:36]
CC: Okay. Thank you.

[04:16:12:38]
CDR: Have fun.

[04:16:12:41]
CC: Roger. And on that quad temperature - the upper limit of that thing is 105 degrees on the bottle. You are well below that. We have been watching it, and it is tracking, although it is tracking very slowly. As you roll the spacecraft, the temperature excursion seem to be a little sluggish, but it isn't a frozen sensor. And talking a little bit more about that one right now, you might tell Jim the next time he goes to work with the optics, when he works with the trunnion, if he'll go ahead and recycle the ZERO OPTICS switch, he can avoid the problem we had prior to midcourse correction 4.

[04:16:13:24]
CDR: We've done that. And the midcourse correction 4.

[04:16:13:25]
CC: Roger.

[04:16:13:26]
CDR: The midcourse correction number 6 right now looks like zero, and midcourse correction number 7 is approximately 2 feet per second.

[04:16:13:38]
_page : 6
CDR: Okay, Jim. Now we've got on the checklist to initiate cabin coldsoak. This involves evaporating, and I don't think we want to do that.

[04:16:13:48]
CC: Okay. Now we talked that over with FIDO, and at 12 hours out, everyone seems to think that we don't need to do it there. But in close, it doesn't seem to have any effect on the trajectory, and what's been suggested if you'd like - we can do over the entry checklist and just kind of walk through it on the air with all the people on the console. Right now, you have the term that will be performing the entry session with you so we can go over the checklist and run down any questions that you might have. That's up to you.

[04:16:14:44]
CDR: That's fine. Let's do that. I've got one right here. I'm lonesome anyway.

[04:16:14:48]
CC: Okay. Give us a few minutes to pull ourselves together and get on the air.

[04:16:22:23]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:16:22:28]
CDR: Go ahead.

[04:16:22:29]
CC: Okay. We've drifted off now about 25 degrees in pitch. I'd like to have you take it back and set up the PTC plane again at pitch of 10 and yaw 45 and set up the PTC under control, and turn your pitch back to minimum impulse. And give us a mark when you have done that, and we'll time the drift rates down here.

[04:16:22:56]
_page : 7
CDR: Okay.

[04:16:25:01]
CDR: Okay, Ken. I've got them all damped out about as low as I can get them.

[04:16:25:05]
CC: Okay. Fine.

[04:16:25:08]
CDR: I'll put in a roll right now.

[04:16:25:10]
CC: Thank you.

[04:16:25:14]
CDR: It takes me three actuations to get about - just about a degree and a half, or a tenth of a de - 0.15 degrees per second.

[04:16:25:23]
CC: Okay. And give a mark when you release the RATE COMMAND in pitch and yaw.

[04:16:25:31]
CDR: I haven't even got them on.

[04:16:25:33]
CC: Oh, okay. Fine.

[04:16:25:35]
CDR: When I gave you - when I gave you that mark, that was it.

[04:16:25:38]
CC: Real fine. Thank you.

[04:16:25:57]
CDR: It's much more sensitive today than it was when it was heavy.

[04:16:26:01]
CC: Roger.

[04:16:26:18]
CDR: Well, the old earth is getting bigger.

[04:16:26:20]
CC: Good show. Going in the right direction, then.

[04:16:26:25]
CDR: Yes. I was beginning to get worried.

[04:16:27:38]
CDR: Ken, be sure and call me if you see the gimbal angles start to get near gimbal are or anything. I'm a little drowsy still. I don't want to end up with another null attitude, like one is enough.

[04:16:27:50]
CC: Roger. Will do.

[04:16:42:57]
_page : 8
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:16:43:00]
CDR: Go ahead, Ken. 

[04:16:43:01]
CC: Okay. Would you reinitialize the PTC attitude, and let's try that one more time.

[04:16:43:09]
CDR: Okay.

[04:16:45:22]
CDR: You ready?

[04:16:45:23]
CC: Okay.

[04:16:45:24]
CDR: okay. Three blips.

[04:16:45:25]
CC: Thank you.

[04:16:45:33]
CDR: There she goes.

[04:16:45:35]
CC: Roger.

[04:16:45:52]
CDR: Is it sleepy out down there, too?

[04:16:45:54]
CC: Say again, please.

[04:16:45:58]
CDR: I say, is it sleepy out down there?

[04:16:46:02]
CC: Roger. It's getting pretty good now. I figure it's getting sleepy up there, though.

[04:16:46:08]
CDR: Yes.

[04:16:46:11]
CC: Okay. Well would you believe that the North beat the South 3 to nothing, and they did that all with a first-quarter field goal. 

[04:16:46:24]
CDR: Very good. When was the East-West game?

[04:16:46:31]
CC: Oh, about Saturday.

[04:16:46:36]
CDR: Next Saturday?

[04:16:46:37]
CC: Yes, sir.

[04:16:46:51]
CC: And, Frank, we are going over the checklist right now, and I'll get back with you on the entry checklist in a few minutes.

[04:16:46:58]
_page : 9
CDR: Okay, Ken. I think it is a pretty good one; that's one thing we have practiced a lot. But we might as well let everybody know what we're doing.

[04:16:47:07]
CC: Roger.

[04:16:47:43]
CDR: Ken, while we are just killing time here, there are a couple of anomolies we've noticed. The booties, you know, for the inflight coveralls; mine have frayed very badly, and I had to take them off. Also, we had one Y adapter with an open in it, and the lightweight headsets were kind of useless.

[04:16:48:04]
CC: Roger.

[04:16:48:12]
CDR: I take that back. I really didn't mean to say that. The lightweight headset - what I really meant to say was - the lightweight headsets are useless.

[04:16:48:22]
CC: Okay.

[04:16:48:30]
CDR: But these Snoopy hats are pretty comfortable. We have worn them the whole time.

[04:16:51:58]
_page : 1
_tape : 75
CDR: Ken, one thing we are going to do on these suits, we're going to Stow them one under each seat, the way North American suggested.

[04:16:52:06]
CC: Roger. And you'll be putting the helmets in the food stowage.

[04:16:52:16]
CDR: Yes, I think we'll put the helmets in the food stowage; and any stuff we have to take out of there, we'll just stick in a suit.

[04:16:52:22]
CC: Okay.

[04:16:52:30]
CDR: Is the weather still good out there?

[04:16:52:33]
CC: It's not quite as clear as it was yesterday; it sure is nice and balmy.

[04:16:52:40]
CDR: No, I mean out at 165 west.

[04:16:52:45]
CC: Okay. Frank, we've got a weather picture here. The forecast shows 2000 scattered and 4000 broken with a high overcast. You might see that as you come down through it, and wave heights 4 feet, wind about 070 at 12 with 10 miles visibility and perhaps some scattered showers in the area, and this is forecast for the twenty-seventh at 16:00 Zulu.

[04:16:54:19]
CDR: Very good; we'll be there.

[04:16:54:22]
CC: Yes, I'm sure you will.

[04:16:54:28]
CDR: I don't think those waves are too high. We're going to have to sit in this heap for about 45 minutes.

[04:16:54:39]
CC: Okay. We'll put in a kit for some small waves.

[04:16:54:47]
CDR: Tell Jerry Hammack if the waves get high, it's his fault.

[04:17:09:51]

CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:17:09:55]
CDR: Go ahead.

[04:17:09:56]
CC: Okay. Why don't you drive it back over to the PTC attitude and put it back in ATTITUDE HOLD for the roll, and we're going back in and review the DTO requirement. You have about the same results, it looks like, on a cursory analysis all three times. So we're going to take another look and see if there is any reason to do it again. If so, we'll call you. You can go ahead and put it back in ATTITUDE HOLD now.

[04:17:10:23]
CDR: Okay, Jim. Thank you.

[04:17:45:03]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8. Radio check.

[04:17:45:05]
CC: Loud and clear, Apollo 8.

[04:17:45:11]
CDR: Okay, Ken. Thank you.

[04:17:45:13]
CC: Roger. It is taking us a little longer to go through and rehash all of the entry checklist than I though, and we are just about to wrap it up now.

[04:17:45:24]
CDR: No problem. Just watch my gimbal angles for me, and give me a call if they get too close.

[04:17:45:29]
CC: Roger. We will watch them.

[04:18:19:19]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:18:19:24]
CDR: Go ahead.

[04:18:19:26]
CC: We would like to look at a couple more DELTA-V tests on the EMS, and the general consensus is that we don't think there is any particular problem.
     We'd like to go ahead and take a look at what you get by running four or five more DELTA-V tests. And prior to that, we'd like to run one of these null bias tests; and since we don't have any way of monitoring any of this stuff on the downlink, I'd like to have you tell us each step when you turn the switch and different orders and things like that. 

[04:18:20:08]
_page : 3
CDR: Okay. 

[04:18:20:41]
CDR: Alright. I'll run a test. 

[04:18:20:48]
CC: Okay. The first thing we want is this null bias, 100 seconds. 
     04 18 20 CDR You stand by, and I'll do a null bias for 100 seconds. Do you want me to put DELTA-V in AUTOMATIC and let it alone for 100 seconds?

[04:18:21:02]
CC: That is affirmed. 

[04:18:21:22]
CDR: Going to DELTA-V; going to AUTO - 

[04:18:21:25]
CDR: Now.

[04:18:21:27]
CC: Roger. 

[04:18:21:45]
CDR: Went to one-tenth and back to zero. 

[04:18:21:50]
CC: Understand; plus one-tenth and back to zero. 

[04:18:21:56]
CDR: One-tenth, now it's a minus one-tenth and back to zero; no, it's not zero yet; wait a minute. 

[04:18:22:29]
CDR: Now it's up some, minus 4; 0.4, that is. 

[04:18:22:33]
CC: Roger. 

[04:18:22:44]
CDR: Minus 25.

[04:18:22:46]
_page : 4
CC: Roger. 

[04:18:22:53]
CDR: Minus 26. 

[04:18:23:06]
CDR: Minus 0.7, and there is 100 seconds; minus 0.7 at 100 seconds. 

[04:18:23:12]
CC: Roger. 

[04:18:23:17]
CDR: Now what do you want? 

[04:18:23:19]
CC: Okay. If we go back to mode, switch to stand by and FUNCTION switch OFF. 

[04:18:23:36]
CDR: Roger. 

[04:18:23:37]
CC: Okay. Now we'd like to do a couple of DELTA-V self-tests. 

[04:18:23:38]
CDR: Okay. 71586.8. 

[04:18:23:43]
CC: Roger. 

[04:18:24:46]
_page : 1
_tape : 76
CDR: Say you're going AUTOMATIC? 

[04:18:24:48]
CC: Roger. 

[04:18:24:51]
CDR: Going to a DELTA-V test now. Counting down. 

[04:18:26:04]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. 

[04:18:27:14]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. 

[04:18:28:47]
CDR: You back, Ken?

[04:18:28:49]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. 

[04:18:28:53]
CDR: Roger. Read you. 

[04:18:28:55]
CC: Okay. We got caught in a station handover there. I didn't copy anything after you said you were putting it to DELTA-V test. 

[04:18:29:06]
CDR: I ran - I ran three tests during that handover. Two over minus 19.6 - two of them are minus 19.8; and one of them, minus 19.6. 

[04:18:29:17]
CC: Okay. That sounds real fine. 

[04:18:29:22]
CDR: Roger. 

[04:18:29:24]
CC: Okay. The other thing that - sometime prior to entry - and we're going to be looking at it - is the normal entry test pattern, and it's called out presently in the checklist as something we do around an hour. And we'd like to check if you can read the number on the scroll that is up now so we can see where we are in the test test pattern sequence. We're considering taking a look at one of these test patterns before we get into an hour so we can have more time to 
     think about it in the event that there should be something anomalous in it. 

[04:18:30:02]
_page : 2
CDR: Why don't we do it right now? We're on number 8. 

[04:18:30:06]
CC: Okay. Understand; that's number 8, right? 

[04:18:30:12]
CDR: Roger. It takes an awful long time to run them over there anyway. It won't hurt to do one. 

[04:18:30:18]
CC: Okay. If you'll stand by just a second; we're checking to see where we stand in the sequence of events for on pattern 8. 

[04:18:32:58]
CDR: Hey, Ken.

[04:18:32:59]
CC: Yes, sir. 

[04:18:33:03]
CDR: Another little thing about this EMS: you know, we had it set up when we separated from the booster - - 

[04:18:33:05]
CC: Roger. 

[04:18:33:10]
CDR: -- and the shock of the separation - the shock of the pyre's blowing in separation knocked it up to 100 and something.

[04:18:33:21]
CC: Understand. Knocked it up to 100. 

[04:18:33:26]
CDR: Roger. 

[04:18:33:27]
CC: Was the pyro separation enough that the - you felt a sensable g in the bird?

[04:18:33:35]
CDR: Roger. Let's just say there wasn't any question we were separating.

[04:18:33:43]
CC: Roger. Understand. 

[04:18:34:00]
CDR: While you are checking the scroll, find out which entry pattern I should be using this bird in.

[04:18:34:06]
_page : 3
CC: Okay. Will do. 

[04:18:39:39]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. 

[04:18:39:44]
CDR: Go ahead. 

[04:18:39:46]
CC: Okay. While we are verifying that scroll position - they are talking it over in the back room about that now - I would like to go ahead and run down the checklist with you for entry. 

[04:18:40:00]
CDR: Go ahead. 

[04:18:40:02]
CC: Okay. Looking on entry 1: the second item there is the 12-hour Kelvin cold soak, and in discussions I here and preflight, I think it is agreed that we don't want to do the cold soak there. So we are going to delete that step 2. And what it amounts to is, I think we do want to do a cold soak, and we certainly want to exercise the water boilers prior to entry in order to insure that we don't have one that is dried out, in the same manner that we had one dried out prior to LOI. And we are working on some procedures for that, and we'll have to come back to you with those a little bit later, and we will try to do it sometime when Bill's on the line so that everybody can get in on the loop at the same time. We would like to add a step between 8 and 9, or as part of step 8. This is all on page E-1, where we turn the VHF to Simplex A at minus 4 hours and 35 minutes. Now this will be beyond two-way VHF range, but it will make sure
     that we do have it on at the time when we pick it up. We were able to get out to 20 000 miles with a downlink, and we are checking on the uplink signal. So if we put it on at this point, we know we have it on well in advance of any time we might be able to get into the VHF. 

[04:18:41:36]
_page : 4
CDR: Okay. 

[04:18:41:43]
CC: Okay. I guess maybe I have that backwards. They copy - you folks copied the VHF out to 20 KM. We're checking on the - on the downlink into that now. But in any event, this 4 hours and 35 minutes will get it well in advance of that. 

[04:18:42:03]
CDR: Roger. 

[04:18:42:40]
CC: Okay, 8. We just got an answer back on the test patterns. We thought it was - We had 25 test patterns which are allocated to ground test, and these are the ones we've been looking at. Then there are five more that are allocated to flight, and the only difference in these patterns is that the flight patterns have instructions actually written on them; so if we are looking at test pattern 8, that means that we're still working on the ones that were allocated to the ground test, so there was no problem there. And I'll get you a number for which pattern we should be using for entry; working on that one right now. So we would like to go ahead and run through these.

[04:18:43:21]
_page : 5
CDR: I don't mean the - - 

[04:18:43:23]
CC: Say again, Frank. 

[04:18:43:25]
CDR: I don't mean the test pattern. I say, I don't mean the test pattern. We asked them to put the supercircular on the number, the first place on the scroll; I'm sure they did. I'm sure it's the first pattern, but I just wanted to make sure that's right. 

[04:18:43:38]
CC: Roger. That's why we are trying to verify. So - - 

[04:18:43:43]
CDR: You want me to run through a test pattern? 

[04:18:43:45]
CC: Yes, sir. If you would, please. And if you'd tell us each step as you go through it. 

[04:18:44:42]
CDR: Okay. Going through step 1; EMS test 1: wait 5 seconds. There's 5 seconds. Going AUTO. Okay- Indicator lights are all OFF; the range is zero, zero. Now I'm gonna slew the hairline over the notch. Okay. And now we go in EMS test 2. 

[04:18:44:45]
CC: Roger. 

[04:18:44:52]
CDR: Got the 0.05g light; all others are out. 

[04:18:44:55]
CC: Roger. 

[04:18:44:58]
CDR: Go on test 3: far side lower light on 10 seconds; going to set the range counter to 58. Okay. Set at 58; going to test 4.

[04:18:45:34]
CC: Roger. 

[04:18:45:50]
CDR: Beautiful. It's perfect. It's right in the corridor. It comes down and stops at zero, zero.

[04:18:45:55]
_page : 6
CC: Very good. 

[04:18:46:04]
CDR: Go in test 5: perfect again. Okay. Now I go 
     to range set.

[04:18:46:34]
CC: Okay. 

[04:18:46:39]
CDR: In STANDBY. 

[04:18:46:43]
CC: Okay. 

[04:18:46:45]
CDR: Okay. That was perfect. 

[04:18:46:47]
CC: Real fine. 

[04:18:47:02]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. I'd like to run one more null 
     bias and looks like we will have exercised everything we can get to. 

[04:18:47:13]
CDR: Okay. DELTA-V AUTO, all zeros. 

[04:18:48:21]
CDR: Minus 2. 

[04:18:48:24]
CC: Roger. Understand minus 2. Alright. Is that 
     minus 2 or minus two-tenths? 

[04:18:48:39]
CDR: Two-tenths, three-tenths now. 

[04:18:48:42]
CC: Okay. Real good. That looks like we - - 

[04:18:48:44]
CDR: It looks like we had a lot of noise on the circuit for a while there, Jim. 

[04:18:48:50]
CC: Yes, we did, too; all those electronic glitches 
     I guess. 

[04:18:48:59]
CDR: Okay. One hundred seconds. it's plus - minus 
     four-tenths. 

[04:18:49:02]
CC: Okay. Real fine. That looks like that's about 
     all of the functions that we can check, and 
     looks like everything is just down the line. 

[04:18:49:15]
_page : 7
CDR: Roger. 

[04:18:49:19]
CC: Okay. We still owe you confirmation that you 
     can expect your high speed scroll to be the first 
     pattern you come to, and I'll let you know as 
     soon as they come in with an answer on it. 

[04:18:49:32]
CDR: Okay . 

CC: I'd like to go ahead and finish going through 
     the entry book if you're ready. 

[04:18:49:37]
CDR: Roger. 

[04:18:49:43]
CC: Okay. We've reviewed most of the book up here, 
     and we will have to come back and suggest a way 
     that we can check out the water boiler prior to 
     getting reentry area. We've reviewed all of the 
     last minutes changes that were put in - pen and 
     ink type things - and they're all looking good. 
     On page E-7, like to add a couple of items. 

[04:18:50:15]
CDR: What's that? 

[04:18:50:16]
CC: Okay. On step 34 under final stowage, which is 
     a sort of catch-all area, there's a step that 
     says secondary glycol to radiator that bypass 
     verify. While we are down in this area, we 
     would like to go to panel 382, the water control 
     panel, and set up the evaporator water control 
     valve both primary and secondary to AUTO. Now 
     this is something we would have done had we done 
     the cold soak at minus 12 hours, but since we
     weren't doing it there, we would like to go 
     ahead and make sure we have these in AUTO, and 
     this will enable automatic controls from the 
     panel. 

[04:18:51:02]
_page : 8
CDR: Can we just make this part of the procedure 
     when we test out the water boilers beforehand? 

[04:18:51:08]
CC: Yes, sir. If we get that checked out earlier, 
     we can just leave them in AUTO. 

[04:18:51:13]
CDR: I'd rather do that. 

[04:18:51:15]
CC: Okay. I'm just going to make a note here, and we can do it the other way, too. The other 
     item that was pen-and-inked in - - 

[04:18:51:23]
CDR: ... 

[04:18:51:27]
CC: You may already have this down as step 35. It 
     says UP TELEMETRY to BLOCK, VERIFY, and there's 
     a step right after that that says RCS command 
     module heaters to circuit breakers CLOSED. 

[04:18:51:43]
CDR: Roger. 

[04:18:51:48]
CC: Okay. 

[04:18:51:49]
CDR: I have that. 

[04:18:51:50]
CC: Okay. I guess that one was sent up to you this 
     afternoon. And when you turn the page over to 
     E-8, it shows the EMS entry check being run at 
     minus an hour, and you know that it's a short 
     test. There is really no reason to wait for an 
     hour; we might as well go ahead and do that as 
     soon as you get through with step 35 on page E-7 
     because we're coming up on a pretty busy period. 

[04:18:52:19]
_page : 9
CDR: I say that's fine; we'll do that. 

[04:18:52:37]
CDR: Houston, are you still there? 

[04:18:52:39]
CC: Roger. We got a discussion going; be right 
     back. 

[04:18:53:50]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. On page E-9 - - 

[04:18:53:57]
CDR: Okay. 

[04:18:53:58]
CC: - - at the top of the page, you have step 38, 
     and right underneath that, prior to step 39, we 
     want to have a primary glycol loop activation. 
     What we are doing is to get the glycol evaporator 
     water switch to AUTO and the glycol evaporator 
     steam pressure switched to AUTO. This  will get your primary water boiler on the line 
     prior to entry, or at least it'll enable it. 

[04:18:54:35]
CDR: Okay. Tell me what to write in, Ken. 

[04:18:54:37]
CC: Okay. It's glycol evaporator water to AUTO. 

[04:18:55:43]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Are you there? 

[04:18:55:55]
CDR: Glycol evaporator water switch to AUTO. 

[04:18:55:59]
CC: Okay. And the second switch is the glycol evaporator steam pressure to AUTO. 

[04:18:56:18]
CDR: Okay. 

[04:18:56:25]
CC: Okay. That takes care of getting the primary 
     water boiler enabled, and it's my understanding 
     that we were going to make the actual entry with 
     both the primary and the secondary water boilers 
     on the line. 

[04:18:56:40]
_page : 10
CDR: I'm not reading you now, Houston. 

[04:18:56:44]
CC: Roger. How now? 

[04:18:56:48]
CDR: Loud and clear. 

[04:18:56:49]
CC: Okay. There's some question from reading the 
     checklist. It is my understanding that both 
     the primary and the secondary water boilers will be ON for the actual entry, and don't find 
     a place in the checklist where it's actually 
     turned on. So we'd like to get confirmation 
     on that, and we'll make sure that we have all 
     the proper switching to put in the checklist. 

[04:18:57:16]
CDR: Okay. 

[04:18:57:23]
CC: Alright. Still on page E-9 and under step 39 
     at the bottom of the pyro circuit check, there's 
     a step that says panel 8, all circuit breakers 
     CLOSED except and then it lists five that are 
     printed, one that was pen-and-inked before 
     launch. It says EDS power circuit breakers 3 
     OPEN, and to be complete, we ought to add the 
     RCS heater circuit breakers. There's two of 
     those, and they should also be OPEN. 

[04:18:58:06]
CDR: Okay. 

[04:18:58:11]
CC: Alright. The rest of these pages look good; 
     I'm coming over through the graphs. And on 
     page E-11 - - 

[04:18:58:48]
_page : 11
CDR: Roger. I'm with you. 

[04:18:58:50]
CC: Okay. On step 5 on E-11, there's - the first 
     subtitle there is Helmets and Gloves, and the 
     items that follow beneath that are affected by 
     whether you wear suits or come in shirt sleeves, 
     but they do have to be accomplished. And the 
     suit return air valves would actually be OPEN 
     for a shirt-sleeve entry. And you should have 
     a line penciled in of optics power to OFF between 
     an emergency cabin pressure valve and the time 
     when the CMP moves to the couch. 

[04:18:59:26]
CDR: Right. 
     04.18 5928 CC Okay. And the step shows the tape recorder to 
     REWIND at minus 30. Now that's an onboard step 
     rather than a ground step, just to verify that. 

[04:18:59:48]
CDR: Okay. 

[04:18:59:50]
CC: Okay. Under step 6, almost at the bottom - in 
     fact, it's three lines from the bottom of 
     step 6 - there's a section that says secondary 
     coolant loop evaporator to RESET, and should 
     be a note that that's 58 seconds if you hold 
     it in RESET prior to moving the pump OFF. 

[04:19:00:12]
CDR: That's it; that's in it. 

[04:19:00:15]
CC: Okay. Okay. The next comment is on page E-13. 

[04:19:00:34]
CDR: Okay. I'm there. 

[04:19:00:36]
CC: Alright. This is a general comment that refers 
     to any time you're working around P62 or when 
     you're going between P62 and P63, and you should 
     be careful not to call an extended VERB during 
     this time. This is here in the program notes, 
     and it is just a reminder. What will happen 
     if we get into an extended VERB such as an 83 
     or an 82? We may get hung-up in P62 2nd have 
     to recycle through it in order to get the 63, 
     and neither of these displays are normally 
     used, and it's just a good practice. And we're 
     just trying to remind you that we don't want to 
     call an extended VERB while we're in P62. 

[04:19:01:22]
_page : 12
CDR: Okay. Neither do we. That's right. 

[04:19:01:24]
CC: Okay. 

[04:19:01:41]
CC: Okay. In going through the rest of it, we 
     didn't find any other things to make comments 
     on. You have all the latest corrections in 
     your checklist. 

[04:19:01:51]
CDR: Roger. The main thing, that is to come up with 
     a way to determine that the boiler - water 
     boiler is not dry and make sure that Bill gets 
     it activated at TMS 7. 

[04:19:02:03]
CC: That is correct, and we will talk to you some 
     more about that next time we catch both you 
     and Bill up. 

[04:19:02:10]
CDR: Righto. 

[04:19:06:41]
CDR: Ken, this is Frank. I am going to be off the 
     headset for about 5 minutes here. 

[04:19:06:44]
_page : 13
CC: Okay. Fine. When you come back, I will have 
     a systems rundown for you. 

[04:19:06:50]
CDR: Fine. 

[04:19:17:12]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8. 

[04:19:17:16]
CC: Okay. Loud and clear. 

[04:19:17:20]
CDR: Back with you. 

[04:19:17:22]
CC: Okay. I've got a few good words for you. The 
     erasable memory has been taken completely apart 
     and looked at, and it looks like it's all okay. 
     Your P01 didn't have any effect. The one thing 
     that might be questionable is if you used a 
     VERB 67 when you get to the NOUN 99 display, 
     you may find that one to be unreliable, and 
     what you're going to get there is the - that's 
     an error display for the W-matrix. And it's 
     something you probably won't be using again 
     anyhow; and if the occasion arises, we can 
     update that one, but it's not a normally used 
     display and everything else, all the operational 
     functions, are good. 

[04:19:18:17]
CDR: Very good. 

[04:19:18:19]
CC: Okay. As of 114 hours, your batteries - you 
     had battery A with 39.32 amp-hours, battery B had 35.21, and battery C 38.46. Your cryo 
     quantities remaining at SSP were the same 
     we gave you the last time, 180 pounds of oxygen 
     per tank and 11 pounds of hydrogen per,tank. At 
     present, the service module RCS, using the 
     computer values for the quantities, you have 
     quad A with 45 percent, Bravo with 50, Charlie 
     with 58, and Delta at 48. What we plan to do 
     with the secondary tanks is to go ahead and 
     turn them on at 37 percent actual, and in the 
     event of lost COMM or something like that, 
     recommend that you use 50 percent onboard 
     gaging as being the time to turn the secondary 
     propellants on. However, as long as we can 
     use our own calculations, why, we might as 
     well leave them tied up. We probably won't 
     get into the secondary propellants prior to 
     entry anyhow. 

[04:19:19:41]
_page : 14
CDR: Roger. 

[04:19:19:42]
CC: Okay. A couple of items I want to check up 
     on: I'd like to confirm that the hatch Dog 
     will be taken off while you're on the chutes 
     if you can. If not, you're going to do that in 
     the water. Is that affirm? 

[04:19:20:00]
CDR: ... 

[04:19:20:13]
CC: Okay. Now we've got a little better sign 1. 
     Like to confirm that the hatch clamps on the 
     side hatch will be taken off either on the 
     chutes or in the water, whichever you can get 
     to. Is that affirm? 

[04:19:20:37]
_page : 15
CDR: Roger. That's affirm. As a matter of fact, 
     we didn't even put - didn't even put them on. 

[04:19:20:45]
CC: Okay. Do you plan to put them on for an entry? 

[04:19:20:50]
CDR: I don't think so. It's held pretty well so 
     far. I don't think - everybody tells me it 
     wouldn't help much anyway. 

[04:19:20:58]
CC: Okay. And we realize we never did find out 
     what happened to the Mae West. Did you leave 
     it blown up, or did you dump it? 

[04:19:21:09]
CDR: We dumped it. 

[04:19:21:12]
CC: Okay. Who was the lucky guy? 

[04:19:21:17]
CDR: The same guy that tried to launch us this afternoon again. 

[04:19:21:23]
CC: Okay. And just as a gee whiz item:you're now 
     a 137 915 out, and you've only accelerated the 
     4883. You might check to make sure you don't 
     have a speed brake hanging. 

[04:19:21:41]
CDR: Uh-oh. 

[04:19:21:44]
CC: Those are nominal values. 

[04:19:21:50]
CDR: Roger. 137 000 miles out, huh? 

[04:19:21:55]
CC: That's affirm. 

[04:19:33:18]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. Over. 

[04:19:33:20]
CC: Loud and clear. 

[04:19:33:27]
LMP: Good morning, or good afternoon, or whatever 
     it is. The JOD is back at the CON; CDR went 
     back to bed. 

[04:19:33:32]
_page : 16
CC: Okay. 

[04:19:33:44]
CC: Looks like all the junior guys have the midwatch. 

[04:19:33:49]
LMP: I know what you mean. I had a little sleep earlier, 
     so I am pretty well rested and want to make sure 
     Frank gets a good snooze here prior to entry. This 
     might be a good time to try out your background 
     music, and see if you have any better luck. 

[04:19:34:16]
CC: Okay. We'll try that a little later. 

[04:19:37:48]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. 

[04:19:38:43]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. 

[04:19:38:49]
LMP: Go ahead, Houston. 

[04:19:38:51]
CC: Okay. I guess we should start off with a little 
     dialogue about sleep. How much did you have? 

[04:19:39:03]
LMP: Well, let's see; whenever it was I told you I went 
     to bed last night till now. Just a second and 
     let me check the flight plan. 

[04:19:40:48]
LMP: Have you got it logged in when it was I asked for 
     that last Seconal? 

[04:19:40:57]
CC: Okay. I guess we can figure that out for ourselves, 
     can't we? 

[04:19:41:02]
LMP: Yes. Why don't you let me know. I have kind of 
     lost track of time it was when I went to bed. But 
     it was about - I went to sleep about 15 minutes after 
     that and woke up about 10 minutes ago. Good sleep. 

[04:19:41:12]
CC: Okay. So I see it is now 142 hours. 

[04:19:41:27]
LMP: What do you think I am, Rip van Winkle? 

[04:19:41:30]
_page : 17
CC: Just trying to find out how soundly you really 
     slept. I guess you are not that sleepy. 

[04:19:41:36]
LMP: . . . but not that. 

[04:19:41:40]
CC: Okay. It's really about 4 hours, Bill. 

[04:19:41:50]
LMP: Okay. Good. 

[04:19:42:39]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Have you got somebody under 
     the left couch, or could you get down to the  water control panel? 

[04:19:42:49]
LMP: I can get down there. Frank hasn't quite gone 
     to sleep yet. 

[04:19:42:52]
CC: Well, what we were thinking about doing was boiling 
     a little out of the secondary evaporator to check 
     it out, just as a component check, something we 
     need to do; but if there's somebody down there in 
     the way, why, we can do that some other time. 

[04:19:43:17]
LMP: Well, if it boils, we are going to know it before - 
     it won't take long to find out it won't boil. 
     There's not a heck of a lot we can do about it, so 
     why don't we wait until someone else wakes up here, 
     Frank wakes up again. How will that be? 

[04:19:43:27]
CC: Yes. That would be fine. There is something you 
     can do; you can reservice it. And it is kind of 
     a tedious process, and that's the reason why we just 
     want to kind of keep our eyes on it so we will have 
     some idea prior to entry if we can count on having 
     two loops or one. Which kind of leads us into 
     another question we are trying to pin down, two 
     questions, in fact. Number one, we would like 
     to verify that you do plan to use both primary 
     and secondary boilers during the actual entry, 
     end we are also looking for a way of checking the 
     primary boiler to make sure it isn't dried out prior 
     to entry. And that is turning into a little more 
     of a challenge than you might suspect. If you 
     have any thoughts on that subject, we can go over 
     that. 

[04:19:44:21]
_page : 18
LMP: The answer to the question is yes, we do plan to 
     use both. Before we get into the water boiler 
     pump though, CDR would like to take a Seconal also; 
     make sure he can get off to sleep here. 

[04:19:44:41]
CC: Okay. That's a GO. 

[04:19:44:46]
LMP: Okay. On the water boiler: it's interesting that 
     I get my own - I was going to say anytime you have 
     our mike keyed, I can hear myself talk with about 
     a 2-second time delay. With respect to the primary 
     and secondary boiler checks, I think that is a good 
     idea to make sure we got them both prior to entry 
     and have the reservicing procedures handy. 

[04:19:45:39]
CC: Roger, Bill. You know the secondary - well, in fact, 
     both reservicing procedures are available in a 
     malfunction book, and sort of the problem with checking 
     out the primary boiler is finding a way to 
     make it boil on the way in. 

[04:19:46:03]
_page : 19
LMP: Yes. Just a second, I got another little chore 
     going here. 

[04:19:46:39]
LMP: Roger. It looks like the only way we'll be able 
     to do it would be to shut off the radiators. 

[04:19:46:48]
CC: We were looking for a little more docile way to 
     do that. 

[04:19:46:55]
LMP: Roger. That way would be agreeable to me too, 
     a little more docile way, but they shouldn't 
     freeze up if we did it quickly. 

[04:19:47:08]
CC: Roger. We are talking over several things, you 
     know, like putting the ten-pin valve to MANUAL 
     or partially closing it or some of these different 
     ideas, and something you can think about while 
     you are laying there with nothing else to do. 

[04:19:47:26]
LMP: Yes. We noticed that it had gotten warmer in 
     the cockpit coming back than it was going out. And 
     I remember going out when we manually positioned 
     the ten-pin valve, but we had pretty good control 
     over the glycol evap outlet temperature. So possibly 
     that would be the thing to attack first rather than 
     the radiators. 

[04:19:47:49]
CC: Okay. We've got the back room boys looking at it. 

[04:19:47:57]
LMP: I guess if we do pick a time, though, we ought to 
     pick a time that if something did go haywire, we 
     could afford to boil . . . the rest of the way in, 
     but still leave us enough time to fix - rig up the 
     evap service if it didn't work. 

[04:19:48:12]
_page : 20
CC: That's affirm, and we're factoring in things 
     like trajectory considerations and all that sort 
     of thing, too. 

[04:19:48:22]
LMP: Right. I think that the second derivative of 
     the water boiler versus time plot will give us 
     the optimum time to do it. 

[04:19:48:45]
CC: EECOM's copying that. 

[04:19:48:52]
CC: There's also speculation you have a chart on 
     board that gives that information. 

[04:19:49:02]
LMP: Well, if I don't, I'm sure those guys can ship 
     one up. They've shipped up some other pretty 
     good ones. 

[04:19:49:08]
CC: It's also been suggested that if you don't have 
     the chart it's on the tape recorder. 

[04:19:49:18]
LMP: Well, if I don't have a chart, I'll put it on the 
     tape recorder. 

[04:19:49:27]
LMP: Okay. I think, unless you guys got some more 
     comments along these lines, maybe we ought to 
     give these guys a chance to get to sleep, and 
     I'll recline here for a while. If you've got 
     something to brief me on, well, go ahead; but 
     I'd like to keep my answers to yes's and no's 
     and whatever else you think you really need. 

[04:19:49:51]
CC: Okay. Fine, Bill, and I'll check with you like
     every 30 minutes, just to make sure we still voice contact. 

[04:19:50:02]
_page : 21
LMP: Okay. I've got some log writing to do and whatnot. 
     So keep an eye on the systems and the gimbal angles, 
     and we'll be all right. 

[04:19:50:11]
CC: Okay. 

[04:19:52:17]
LMP: And, Ken, if your EECOM man wants to play the 
     OMNI-switch game, we're on Dog - Bravo at this 
     time, actually on Bravo but also configured for 
     D's - correction, we are on D and also configured 
     for Bravo. If you want to switch, we'll go ahead. 

[04:19:52:43]
CC: Okay, we'll give that a try, and we are cranking 
     up some Background music for you. 

[04:19:52:55]
LMP: Okay. The last time they did that, it sounded 
     like they were running at the wrong speed on the 
     tape, but we're a little closer now. Maybe it'll 
     be a little better. 

[04:19:53:02]
CC: Would you also believe Doppler shift? 

[04:19:53:14]
LMP: Might be another way to range. 

[04:19:53:25]
LMP: Probably it was Doppler shift; we're heading 
     back out again, 

[04:19:53:38]
CC: Looks like we can use your humming for backup 
     ranging in case everything else fails. 

[04:19:53:46]
LMP: Roger. 

[04:19:54:15]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. You don't need to answer 
     this transmission, but doctors observe that it 
     looks like your - some of your sensors may be 
     working loose, so you might just kind of push on 
     them and see if they are in place. 

[04:19:54:56]
_page : 22
LMP: That do any good? 

[04:19:55:03]
CC: Looks like it is one of your sternals, Bill. 

[04:19:55:21]
CC: Apollo 8. We can't handle the OMNI switching 
     for about thirty more minutes, till we get back 
     to an 85-foot disk, so you will have to watch 
     the antenna store for a few more minutes. 

[04:19:56:05]
LMP: Okay. I don't see any loose sensor - the upper, 
     upper ... 

[04:19:56:18]
LMP: Are you trying to call, Houston? 

[04:19:56:21]
CC: No, I didn't. It sounded like you were getting 
     an echo, and I checked, and I hadn't held the 
     key down at the time either. 

[04:19:56:27]
LMP: Okay. I don't see any loose sensors, but the 
     upper sternal is beginning to irritate a little 
     bit, but not badly; and possibly there is something going on there. 

[04:19:56:43]
CC: Okay. And did you copy about the antenna? 

[04:19:56:49]
LMP: They really disappoint me, but I'll keep that 
     in mind. 

[04:20:02:28]
_page : 1
_tape : 77
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. I'd like to make a voice 
     check with you. 

[04:20:03:01]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check. 

[04:20:03:32]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check. 

[04:20:04:13]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check. 

[04:20:05:12]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check. 

[04:20:05:50]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check. 

[04:20:06:37]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston in the blind now. We're 
     not receiving down-voice. We have data, and 
     it appears it's probably a ground problem. 

[04:20:07:12]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. 

[04:20:07:17]
LMP: Roger, Houston. Read you loud and clear. 

[04:20:07:19]
CC: Okay. I got you that time. I take it you were 
     able to copy us with the music? Is that affirm? 

[04:20:07:28]
LMP: I was able to copy you all the time, Ken, but 
     I could only hear the music when you were trying 
     to transmit. And I wondered if you noticed 
     cycling on my suit power switch when you - 
     when you called me. I am hearing an echo now. 

[04:20:07:47]
CC: Roger. I copy your echo. And what switch were 
     you cycling? 

[04:20:07:57]
LMP: I was cycling the suit power which turns off 
     the BIOMED periodically. I figured that would 
     wake the doctors up. 

[04:20:08:10]
_page : 2
CC: It appears that we have more than one communications problem. 

[04:20:08:17]
LMP: Roger. 

[04:20:11:25]
CC: Calm it. (Laughter) 

[04:20:11:36]
LMP: You are cutting out, Houston. 

[04:20:11:40]
CC: Oh, that was an inadvertent cut-in. 

[04:20:11:45]
LMP: Okay. 

[04:20:18:34]
LMP: You need the high gain, Houston, or will the 
     OMNI's be okay? 

[04:20:18:50]
CC: 8, Houston. That's negative. The OMNI is 
     okay. 

[04:20:18:56]
LMP: Roger. Be advised that about 50 - I am hearing 
     these echos quite a bit of the time, and if 
     you are trying to play music, I am not hearing 
     it. 

[04:20:19:06]
F: Roger. We understand, and we are not trying 
     to play music right now. 

[04:20:19:15]
LMP: Okay. who is this, COMM TECH? 

[04:20:19:22]
F: Ken is only human. This is his substitute; 
     this is Flight Director. 

[04:20:19:32]
LMP: Oh, I didn't recognize your voice there. 

[04:20:19:36]
F: I don't get to talk often. 

[04:20:19:37]
LMP: Who is substituting for you now, Flight? 

[04:20:19:43]
F: DFD. 

[04:20:19:46]
LMP: Okay. Things are looking pretty good from 
     here. How about down there? 

[04:20:19:55]
F: It couldn't be better. 

[04:20:20:03]
_page : 3
LMP: You guys are doing a great job. I really 
     appreciate it. 

[04:20:23:23]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Going to be handling over 
     sites at 25. I will make a voice check with 
     you when we come up on the new site, and the 
     ground says thank you for your kind words. 

[04:20:23:38]
LMP: Okay. We will be standing by. 

[04:20:25:36]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston through Honeysuckle. 

[04:20:25:42]
LMP: Roger, Houston. Loud and clear. 

[04:20:25:43]
CC: Okay, Bill, and our BIOMED data still looks 
     a little bit squirrelly. How about checking 
     the blue signal conditioner on your BIOMED 
     harness. You have one connector, should be 
     the center package, has a blue connector on 
     it. You kind of check that, and I don't 
     know if you have changed the BIOMED harness 
     leads recently; if you have, this might have  
     caused our problem. 

[04:20:26:18]
LMP: Roger. I was just cracking open some acorns 
     here for breakfast. Let me put them down, and 
     I will check my BIOMED leads. 

[04:20:26:25]
CC: There is no rush on it. 

[04:20:28:21]
LMP: Everything seems shipshape. 

[04:20:49:26]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. 

[04:20:49:58]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. 

[04:20:50:02]
LMP: Go, Houston. 

[04:20:50:05]
_page : 4
CC: Okay, Bill. We're ready to try this music 
     on a different kind of latch-up this time. 
     What I'd like to do in order to make sure 
     that we maintain voice COMM is when you get 
     it if you would, give us a call and tell us 
     you have the music and any comment about its 
     relative volume or anything like that. And 
     if I get your call, then I'll call you back 
     and tell you. And what will happen is when 
     I go to talk to you we'll drop the music 
     link. And we can go ahead and take over the 
     switching of the antennas if you like. 

[04:20:50:49]
LMP: okay. I'm in Bravo Dog switch configuration, 
     and go ahead with the music. Be advised last 
     time the fidelity was low, and the volume was 
     too high. 

[04:20:51:02]
CC: Okay. And if you'll give us the same kind of 
     comment, hopefully not the same comment but 
     the same type of evaluation when you pick it 
     up this time. 

[04:20:51:15]
LMP: Play it a little bit, and we'll talk about it. 

[04:20:52:15]
LMP: I can barely, barely hear it. 

[04:20:53:21]
LMP: Needs to be just a hair louder. 

[04:20:53:37]
LMP: That's good. 

[04:20:53:49]
_page : 5
LMP: That will keep me awake. 

[04:20:54:03]
LMP: Maybe you ought to crank if. back down a little 
     bit. 

[04:20:54:16]
LMP: Great. 

[04:20:54:53]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. How was that? 

[04:20:54:58]
LMP: That's real good for background level type, 
     Ken. Maybe you can do some logging in here 
     so that's real nice at that level; maybe for 
     anything else it could be a little bit louder, 
     but that's good for now. 

[04:20:55:10]
CC: Okay. Thats about the MAX volume we can 
     take down here; so if you want to talk to us, 
     you may have to call us once or twice. You're 
     just barely equaling it. 

[04:20:55:24]
LMP: Okay. Try it again, and I'll give you a little 
     louder call; I've been trying to keep it 
     quiet. 

[04:20:55:30]
CC: Oh, yes, that's all right. Don't - I was 
     aware you were calling; I just didn't make out 
     what you said. And from now on, any time you 
     call, we'll drop the music, and I'll talk to 
     you. 

[04:20:55:42]
LMP: Roger. Don't hesitate for me a bit. 

[04:20:55:46]
_page : 6
CC: Right. 

[04:20:56:00]
CC: And, Bill, we're going to have to wait until 
     we get around to Bravo before we start switching. Our margin is still a little bit low. 

[04:20:56:10]
LMP: Okay. I'll just go ahead and switch it and 
     save you all that trouble. 

[04:20:56:14]
CC: Okay. Thank you. Our midnight DVA show's 
     back on the air. 

[04:20:56:20]
LMP: Roger. 

[04:20:57:11]
LMP: Really great now. 

[04:21:14:57]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Check your yaw gimbal angle. 

[04:21:15:04]
LMP: You must have been reading my mind. 

[04:21:15:07]
CC: No, the DSKY's. 

[04:21:15:13]
LMP: Oh, okay. 

[04:21:15:21]
LMP: When you go to high gain, would you tell me? 

[04:21:15:46]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. 

[04:21:15:53]
CC: Go ahead, Apollo 8. 

[04:21:15:56]
LMP: Ken, do you want me to use the high gain when 
     we come around, or is the OMNI sufficient? It 
     doesn't matter to me. 

[04:21:16:07]
CC: Okay. The OMNI is doing fine. I was just 
     watching your middle gimbal angle there; it was 
     getting a little far out. 

[04:21:16:17]
_page : 7
LMP: Oh, okay. I thought you - I was, too. I
     thought you said check the DSKY, and I thought 
     you were talking about the high gain antenna. 

[04:21:16:23]
CC: No, I'm sorry. I was just watching your middle 
     gimbal. 

[04:21:16:25]
LMP: Yes, this thing really slops around in deadband, 
     but it's really nice flying otherwise. 

[04:21:16:40]
CC: Glad to hear that. 

[04:21:16:47]
LMP: All I have used the while trip is pulse. 

[04:21:16:54]
CC: You just woke the doctor up. You said pulse, 
     and he came alive. And he'd like to know if 
     you did in fact, check out the BIOMED harness. 

[04:21:17:07]
LMP: Yes, I tightened down all the plugs and checked 
     all the leads, and everything looked in order. 
     And when the other fellows wake up, if you 
     remind me, why, I'll give it a more thorough 
     going over. 

[04:21:17:55]
CC: Okay, Bill. It's been suggested that they would 
     like to see you try switching the two leads, 
     you know, a yellow and a blue one, and just go 
     ahead and switch them, and they'll sacrifice 
     their pneumogram because they'd rather have the 
     EKG. 

[04:21:18:25]
LMP: Do they need it now, or can they wait until 
     somebody else wakes up? 

[04:21:18:35]
_page : 8
CC: I guess we can wait, Bill. Is that a hard 
     thing to get to? 

[04:21:18:43]
LMP: You have to take your pants off and about 
     everything else - stand by. 

[04:21:22:07]
LMP: How's that, Houston? 

[04:21:22:13]
CC: Okay. Stand by, Bill. We'll take a look at 
     it. 

[04:21:22:30]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. 

[04:21:22:33]
CC: Roger. Read you. We're looking at data now. 
     (Laughter) 

[04:21:22:40]
LMP: I suppose you'll tell me my heart has quit 
     beating. 

[04:21:22:44]
CC: We couldn't argue with you. That doesn't help 
     at all. That's pretty bad. 

[04:21:23:12]
LMP: Is the pneumogram NO-GO for entry? 

[04:21:23:17]
CC: Roger. 

[04:21:23:24]
CC: One thing you might be interested in: we 
     listened to that low speed information that 
     you taped on the first couple of REV's that 
     we thought was going to be unusable. And it 
     must have been a ground problem because it's 
     coming in loud and clear now. 

[04:21:23:41]
LMP: Hey, that's great. I was just writing a long 
     dissertation on why we have problems and can't 
     use that DSE in low bit rate. So that's real 
     good. 

[04:21:23:55]
_page : 9
CC: Yes, it's coming in loud and clear. Pretty 
     interesting. 

[04:21:24:00]
LMP: Let me tell you, it was a hectic revolution. 

[04:21:25:13]
LMP: If you've got the music going, I'm not hearing 
     it, Ken. 

[04:21:25:17]
CC: No, I was waiting to see what we did on that 
     before I started it up again. 

[04:21:25:23]
LMP: Okay. If they could hold off here for a couple 
     of hours, if they have anything at all, just 
     tell them I'm alive, why, I'll give my real 
     good going over here when I get done. I might 
     even make a statement to the world that I haven't 
     noticed that their little amplifiers had gotten 
     hot. 

[04:21:25:41]
CC: You say it did get hot? 

[04:21:25:46]
LMP: No, I hadn't even noticed it until I started 
     changing the lead. 

[04:21:25:49]
CC: Oh, okay. Okay. I'm going to crank the music 
     up again then. 

[04:21:25:56]
LMP: Okay. Have they got anything at all down there?

[04:21:26:00]
CC: Well, we're on low bit rate right now, so it'll 
     be a few minutes before we get a chance to take 
     another look at it. We'll let you know if you 
     get sick. 

[04:21:26:07]
LMP: Oh, well, we can hold off for a little while. 

[04:21:26:13]
CC: Roger. 

[04:21:27:02]
_page : 10
LMP: I can't hear it, but it sounds like something 
     I'd rather not hear anyway.

LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. 

[04:22:17:43]
CC: Hello, Apollo 8. We interrupt this program of 
     music to bring you the late evening status report. 

[04:22:17:50]
LMP: Good. What's up? 

[04:22:17:56]
CC: Okay. We are getting ready to have a shift turnover, and I wanted to go over a few items before 
     I do. On the midcourse correction number 6: right 
     now, that looks like it is at most 0.3 a foot per 
     second, so there will be no burn for midcourse 
     number 6. Midcourse number 7 is a little larger, 
     and we'll make a decision on that later. Your 
     weather in landing site still reported as being good 
     and the forecast to be about 2000 scattered and 
     12 000 broken, about the same numbers they gave 
     Frank earlier. Visibility will be about 10 miles, 
     wave height about 4 feet. And I guess there is some 
     scattered thundershowers, like less than 5 percent, 
     that you should worry about. And they're 10 to 
     30 percent maybe at 2000, broken as opposed to 
     scattered; so it looks pretty fair. We have got 
     a-- 

[04:22:19:12]
LMP: Just my kind of weather. 

[04:22:19:14]
CC: Roger. Got a couple of flight plan things to 
     consider. Now number 1 at 119:30: we have got a 
     P52 IMU realignment which we need to slip in ahead 
     of the P23 sightings, and that will be an option 3 
     REFSMMAT. 
     04 22.19 40 LMP Roger. 

[04:22:19:45]
_page : 2
CC: Okay. Some of the folks in sitting back and 
     looking at the TV business have some ideas about 
     things they would like to see tried with the filters. 
     And I would like to read you what they have here 
     and let you think about it; and in the next 10 hours, 
     you can decide whether or not you think it is worth 
     the effort. Basically, they would like to try using 
     a whole different series of filters - - 

[04:22:21:04]
LMP: Okay, Ken. I got something to write on. Was that 
     P52 at 18:30 or 19:30? 

[04:22:21:11]
CC: 119:30. 

[04:22:21:15]
LMP: Okay. I'm ready to copy on TV. 

[04:22:21:31]
CC: Okay. Before you copy, let me read it all through 
     to you here so you will get the feel for what it 
     is we are talking about. The title of this little 
     epistle is "TV and Film Photography Correlation 
     Experiment," and what they want to do is mount 
     the TV camera with the telephoto lens on a bracket. 
     in the rendezvous window and take a TV picture 
     of the earth through the red and blue filters, 
     1 minute per filter; that means red and blue 
     filters individually. Then they would like to 
     take a TV picture of the earth through through 
     the red, in this case, the 25 Alfa filter combined 
     with the polarizing filter. Rotate the polarizing 
     filter through 360-degree increments, again 1 minute I 
     per position. Then they'd like to take a TV picture 
     of the moon with the polarizing filter at 360-degree 
     moon-rotation increments and again, 1 minute per 
     position. And to go with this, we would like to 
     have Hasselblad pictures. 

[04:22:22:44]
_page : 3
LMP: One minute. 

[04:22:22:45]
CC: Okay. I am standing by. 

[04:22:22:49]
LMP: Are those - when you were talking about pictures 
     through the polarizing filter, is that the TV pictures 
     through the polarizing filter? 

[04:22:22:55]
CC: That's affirmative. All above was TV.

[04:22:22:59]
LMP: Okay. Now the only thing - the only problem here 
     is it's darn near impossible to aim that television 
     camera; the field of view is so narrow that it 
     took three men and a boy up here to get the thing 
     pointed in the right direction. And we tried using 
     chewing gum for a sight and everything else, and 
     let me tell you that the odds of getting that thing 
     in the earth is pretty small. 

[04:22:23:25]
CC: Okay. I think we weren't too clever in our ground 
     callup as to how to point the spacecraft. For one 
     thing I think we can do that a lot better next time 
     now that we have stumbled through it once. I agree 
     with you - - 

[04:22:23:41]
_page : 4
LMP: It's not the spacecraft; it's not the spacecraft 
     that's hard to point, it's the camera. The bracket 
     has sufficient slump in it that it can take the 
     camera out of field of view when configured through 
     the window. And it took a lot of microadjustments 
     with a lot of coaching from the ground to get the 
     thing in, and it was a real tough job. So I think 
     you ought to take all this in mind; if you could 
     possibly use the wide angle, you might be better off. 

[04:22:24:14]
CC: Okay. I understand what you are saying now. I'll 
     run that back by the TV guys and see what they have 
     to say about that. In conjunction with the above, 
     they wanted to take some Hasselblad pictures of the 
     earth through the rendezvous window with the red 
     and blue filter and black and white film, and then 
     again through the polarizing filter, and this is all 
     going to be used in order to try and correlate the 
     TV and the regular film photography. So if you think 
     it is a worthwhile thing, and you would like to give 
     it a try, I'll run this by Jack and the TV cats and 
     see if they would like.to get something out of it 
     with the wide angle, and we can talk about it a little 
     later. 

[04:22:25:05]
LMP: Okay. Another thing to keep in mind is that we 
     haven't seen the moon - we didn't see all the way 
     out, and we rarely see it going back. We have seen 
     it once since we left, but we have maneuvered the 
     wrong way from a sighting attitude to the shortest 
     way to PTC and to go from an earth view to a lunar 
     view will take quite a bit of time and some RCS. 
     So you might keep that in mind, too. 

[04:22:25:35]
_page : 5
CC: Okay. I just wanted you to be aware of this and 
     think about it and what its implications to the 
     flight plan might be, and I'll run this wide angle 
     and comment about the moon back by and see which 
     sections they think would be most appropriate. 
     Okay. On the EMS scroll, Frank wanted us to verify 
     the order that he could expect to see the entry 
     profile, and the first profile that comes up is 
     labelled "Nonexit Number 2" and that is the short-range 
     high-speed entry. The second thing that will 
     come up is entitled "The 3500 Mile" which is also 
     high-speed entry, but it is the one you would use 
     in event we go to the longer entry ranges. Then 
     the third profile will be "Nonexit Entry Number 1," 
     and it will be followed by a forth 3500 mile. So 
     you have four entry profiles. Numbers 1 and 3, as 
     you come to them, are the short ranges, and numbers 2 
     and 4 are the long-range scrolls. On coldsoak, 
     I think we talked about what we're going to do there, 
     but somewhere inside of about an hour, we'll want 
     to get into the coldsoak business. We certainly 
     don't want to do it at 12. Talking to the trajectory 
     people - what they thought about water boiling - 
     page 6 
     something to keep in mind is the fact that they 
     do see your water dumps and water boiling on your 
     trajectory plot. It seems to be that it's a function 
     of their computational scheme rather than a 
     function of the fact that the trajectory is being 
     perturbed that much. So it looks like one time that 
     we're going to consider, if we're going to do some 
     of this water boiling, we may do it just prior to 
     the midcourse after all the tracking is settled 
     down and they know what the midcourse correction 
     will be. Then in that period just prior to the 
     midcourse we can do it, and they'll pick up their 
     tracking again following the midcourse correction. 
     So if someone proposes that the - - It is probably 
     nice to know that we are not throwing away our 
     data at the most important time, that it is a function 
     of the computer program rather than so much 
     a function of your trajectory being changed. 

[04:22:28:04]
LMP: Let me ask you one thing then. Do you want a 
     coldsoak sometime prior to the midcourse correction 
     for 1 hour. Is that what you're trying to tell me? 

[04:22:28:12]
CC: Not really. I think we are looking at that prior 
     to the midcourse correction as being the time 
     when we would like to check out the water boilers. 
     The coldsoak does involve some water boiler, too, 
     but that's going to be done right before entry when 
     these things are not going to be very sensitive, 
     and if we don't do it in 12 hours, it is not 
     real clear where the coldsoak takes place or 
     where you turn on the secondary water boiler. 
     In looking through the entry checklist tonight, 
     we didn't find a place for that. 

[04:22:28:48]
_page : 7
LMP: Okay. Is it really clear that you need the cold 
     soak? We kind of figured on sometime prior to 
     SEP bringing up the secondary EVAP, and also 
     having the primary at that point sometime prior 
     to that date on your suggestion. 

[04:22:29:06]
CC: Okay. We're talking about doing that like an hour 
     prior to SEP; but in the pre-SEP check, one of the 
     things we power down was the secondary loop. And 
     they won't need to turn it back. 

[04:22:29:21]
LMP: Ye do that to save - - 

[04:22:29:22]
CC: Right. We're doing that to keep our power profile 
     where we want it. And then we're going to be turning 
     it back on sometime prior to entry. And the time 
     to turn it on in entry, of course, isn't specified 
     because as you turn it on, the voltages show that 
     they can hack it. 

[04:22:29:41]
CDR: Hopefully, right after separation. 

[04:22:29:43]
CC: That sounds like a real good place. Okay. I'm 
     sure we're going to discuss that one a little bit 
     more, Bill. But right now those are the kind of 
     things we're talking about doing. And on the 
     high gain, there is still a lot of discussion about 
     as to what - exactly what we saw and what it 
     means. And I think it is a little too early to 
     tell you anything about that one. 

[04:22:30:11]
_page : 8
LMP: Roger. I think it's got X-ray eyes. 

[04:22:30:17]
CC: That's as good as some of the explanations. 

[04:22:30:26]
LMP: Yes, I think that's what they hashed out on the 
     ground, Ken. 

[04:22:30:29]
CC: Okay. I think we all agree that we don't want 
     to try experimenting with it if we really don't 
     know what it is we're looking at. 

[04:22:30:39]
LMP: Roger. I've written down some numbers here that 
     I hope will be helpful. 

[04:22:30:43]
CC: Okay. Fine. 

[04:22:30:46]
LMP: And I'll give them to you in the debriefing. 

[04:22:30:49]
CC: Real fine. 

[04:22:30:52]
LMP: I don't think it's any great big deal, because 
     the antenna switching is not hard at all and the 
     ... is required to work; if it doesn't work as 
     advertised, at least it works in a reasonable 
     manner. 

[04:22:31:26]
CC: Okay. And we're looking at 120 hours for,the next 
     water dump, Bill. 

[04:22:33:41]
LMP: Ken, is it my imagination, or do you have the 
     music running? 

[04:22:33:45]
CC: I'm sorry; say again. 

[04:22:33:49]
LMP: Is it my imagination, or do you have the music 
     running? 

[04:22:33:54]
_page : 9
CC: I think it's your imagination. 

[04:22:33:59]
LMP: Uh-oh. Don't let the doctors hear that. 

[04:22:34:01]
CC: It's too late; he already heard you: 

[04:22:34:06]
LMP: I must be getting that detached feeling. 

[04:22:36:49]
LMP: Apollo 8, Houston. 

[04:22:36:51]
CC: Go ahead, 8. 

[04:22:36:55]
LMP: Roger. Just to make sure the urge to get red 
     and blue filter shots of the moon haven't crept 
     into this TV test. We have got red and blue 
     filter shots of the moon, so you need not worry 
     about that. 

[04:22:37:12]
CC: Okay. I don't think that would throw it away. I 
     think we're trying to come up with something definitive 
     so that postflight will have some real good data 
     to compare with what we do on the ground for future 
     work. I would like to have you go over and take a 
     look at the battery Charlie, please. 

[04:22:37:35]
LMP: I'm on my way. 

[04:22:38:08]
LMP: Okay. Battery Charlie, that's about 36.8 volts. 

[04:22:38:13]
CC: Okay, 36.8. Thank you. 

[04:22:38:19]
LMP: Roger. 

[04:22:38:26]
LMP: Also with respect to the TV test, I would think 
     that we could probably get a pretty good handle 
     on the operation just by taking red and blue and 
     polarizing shots of the earth independent of the 
     TV, but within the same time frame or at about the 
     same range we had the TV last time. 

[04:22:38:54]
_page : 10
_tape : Tape 78
CC: Okay. That's what - the second portion of this
     really is asking that we do this with the Hasselblad,
     and again we won't be using the red and blue filters
     so we have our baseline.

[04:22:39:08]
LMP: Taking a picture of the earth with the Hasselblad
     is no big deal because it does swing by the earth
     now and then. But trying to get the TV and the
     Hasselblad all pointed to the earth at the same
     time would really be tough.

[04:22:39:21]
CC: Roger. I don't think that it's that time-critical,
     but I'll ask.

[04:22:59:15]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8.

[04:22:59:18]
CC: Go ahead, 8.

[04:22:59:26]
CC: Go ahead, 8.

[04:22:59:29]
LMP: We're going to hold up on the LiOH change for
     about a half an hour. The PCO2 reading is low,
     and we don't want to wake up the CDR. It's right
     by his feet.

[04:22:59:40]
CC: Good headwork.

[04:23:02:46]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[04:23:02:50]
LMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[04:23:02:53]
CC: Okay, Bill. We are coming up on the P52 and then
     the P23 sightings, and there is some concern that
     if we just go directly to P23 attitude that we are
     liable to overheat quad Charlie. So we would like
     to have you maneuver to place the minus X-axis
     towards the sun now. And I have some gimbal angles
     here for you. And if we take it over there and
     point the minus X at the sun between now and the
     time we have to start into the alignment, then
     the P23 business - we will tend to coldsoak
     Charlie, and then we will be able to go through
     the P23 operations without worrying about the
     temperatures.

[04:23:03:45]
_page : 11
LMP: Okay. Give me them.

[04:23:03:47]
CC: Okay. Roll 183.3, pitch 136.7; yaw 13.5.

[04:23:04:27]
LMP: Right. 183 roll, 137 pitch, and 14 yaw.

[04:23:04:31]
CC: Okay.

[04:23:04:36]
LMP: Actually, we worked out up here on Lovell's slide
     rule and got 183.25 roll.

[04:23:06:15]
LMP: Houston, you wanted to go to this coldsoak
     attitude prior to the P52, did you not?

[04:23:06:21]
CC: We would like to go to the coldsoak attitude now.

[04:23:06:27]
LMP: And that was to keep from heating up quad D, was it?

[04:23:06:30]
CC: Negative. That's quad Charlie.

[04:23:06:36]
LMP: Okay.

[04:23:33:57]
LMP: Roger, Houston. Apollo 8.

[04:23:34:00]
CC: Roger. The P23 that is coming up next - we
     will want to do a water dump as soon as we are
     through with that P23. We'll dump down to
     30 percent, and this ought to be the last dump
     of the mission. Over.

[04:23:34:15]
LMP: Okay. You think that we will end up generating
     enough water to fill her up prior to entry.

[04:23:34:20]
CC: Affirmative.

[04:23:34:31]
LMP: Okay. We are at that attitude you gave us,
     so we stopped the roll a little bit short.
     We're more like 150 degrees roll right now.

[04:23:34:39]
CC: Okay, Bill. On that water dump, we expect
     to have 90 percent.

[04:23:34:46]
LMP: Okay.

[04:23:41:54]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. Over.

[04:23:41:57]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[04:23:42:06]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go.

[04:23:42:11]
LMP: Roger. We are done with the P52 and arranged
     for the P23. Was there any constraint you
     wanted, for length of time you wanted to stay
     in this attitude?

[04:23:42:25]
CC: Negative, Bill. When you are finished with
     P23, we will go back into PTC.

[04:23:42:35]
LMP: Okay. We are going to maneuver for P23 now.

[04:23:42:38]
_page : 2
CC: Roger. We are watching your tank pressures.

[04:23:42:43]
LMP: Okay. Thank you. We will do an optical first
     and then do the P23.

[04:23:42:46]
CC: Okay.

[04:23:44:51]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We are handing over to Madrid
     in about 15 seconds. Over.

[04:23:44:58]
LMP: Roger. And good morning, Jerry, or good
     afternoon, or whatever it is.

[04:23:45:03]
CC: Good morning, Jim. It's about 6:30 in the
     morning.

[04:23:45:35]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read?

[04:23:45:40]

CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[05:00:17:53]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[05:00:17:54]
CC: Morning, Frank. Looks like we have lost the
     transducer on the primary radiator OUT
     temperature. We are showing an off scale high. The
     rest of the loop looks real fine, though. When
     you get a chance, would you take a look at it
     and see if you're in the same position. Over.

[05:00:18:15]
CDR: Which one is it?

[05:00:18:16]
CC: Primary radiator OUT temperature.

[05:00:18:22]

[05:00:22:09]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go.

[05:00:22:14]
LMP: Roger. About this RAD output temp: does your
     telemetry show that it happened all of a sudden?

[05:00:22:20]
CC: That's affirmative, Bill.

[05:00:22:25]
LMP: Okay. I'm on malfunction 23, step 2. It looks
     to me like there is a small possibility we
     might be boiling, but I doubt it. So you just
     want to hop over to step 4 and consider that
     a closed case.

[05:00:22:48]
CC: Roger. We consider it closed.

[05:00:25:25]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[05:00:25:31]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[05:00:25:33]
CC: Roger. Frank, all of your primary loop
     temperature readings look just fine. Your EVAP IN
     temperatures are normal and indicate you are
     getting normal mixing.

[05:00:25:47]
CDR: Okay. Thank you.

[05:00:27:44]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[05:00:27:48]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[05:00:27:50]
CC: Roger. For the P23 attitude that you are in
     right now, your quad tank temperatures are
     better than we expected. We're still 
     monitoring, and it's looking good.

[05:00:28:05]
CDR: Thank you. After we complete this, do you
     want us to return to the PTC attitude? Is
     that correct?

[05:00:28:15]
_page : 4
CC: That is affirmative, Frank.

[05:00:28:19]
CDR: Would you have someone get up the gimbal angles
     for us to point the X-axis at the earth at the
     TV time, please?

[05:00:28:25]

[05:00:28:59]
CDR: Also, Jerry, I would like to know our range and
     velocity at TV time.

[05:00:29:05]

[05:00:35:20]
CDR: Jerry, in doing these P23's, we were just about
     over Africa most of the time. At least, it
     was in view; nice weather over there this time
     of year.

[05:00:35:29]
CC: Roger. You want to go down there?

[05:00:35:34]
CDR: Do a little hunting.

[05:00:42:43]

     and says you are right, 97 800 miles.

[05:00:42:54]

[05:00:43:00]

     122 hours, when you came up with that six-tenths
     of a foot per second?

[05:00:44:21]
_page : 6
CC: Roger. Jim, at exactly 122 we were figuring 0.5.

[05:00:44:27]
CMP: Roger. I'll try it again now at the same time
     using the P37 with MA. The last time we did
     it, before the last sightings, I got 2 feet per
     second. I'm going to see what I come up with
     this time.

CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[05:00:53:24]

     we have a crew status report?

[05:00:53:33]
CDR: You may, we had a good night sleep. Everyone
     slept at least 7 hours yesterday, and we have
     just finished breakfast, drunk a lot of water,
     and I think we are in very good shape; just used
     the exerciser.

[05:00:53:54]
CC: Roger, Frank.

[05:00:53:55]
CDR: What would you like to know about?

[05:00:54:02]
CC: That's about it. Are you ready for some morning
     news?

[05:00:54:04]
CDR: Yes.

[05:00:54:07]
CC: Okay. There is really not a whole lot in the
     news this morning. Things are kind of quiet.
     I guess the biggest news is the accident rate -
     the holiday deaths - which is certainly not very
     pleasant news, but we had 233 people killed
     nationally, and 9 of them were in Houston on
     Christmas Eve, and Christmas. In the world news, the
     families made the news again. This is
     Associated Press: "The families of Apollo 8 crew sent :
     a Christmas message to Navy Commander Lloyd
     Bucher, Captain of the USS Pueblo crew, released
     this week by North Korea. The message, addressed
     to Commander and Mrs. Bucher, at San Diego Navy
     hospital read 'You have been in our thoughts and
     our prayers. Your reunion has brought great joy
     into our heart this Christmas day. Our best to
     you personally and to all of the families under
     your command'. And it was signed 'Families of
     the crew of Apollo 8.' Space officials said that
     the message had been suggested and written by
     Mrs. Frank Barman.

[05:00:55:15]
_page : 2
CDR: Thank you.

[05:00:55:16]
CC: Let see. Elsewhere in the national news, the
     newlyweds, David and Julie Eisenhower, came away
     from their secret honeymoon hideaway to have
     Christmas dinner with President-elect Nixon and
     the family. In New York city, the world's 
     busiest harbor was reduced to almost complete 
     inactivity Christmas day, due to a 5-day old 
     longshoreman strike and a rare hiatus in shipping
     schedule. No ships arrived or left the harbor.
     Ferries, running on reduced holiday schedule,
     provided the only marine activity.

[05:00:56:01]
CC: Here is an interesting little feature item that
     is kind of good to hear. It seems that up in
     Ann Arbor, Michigan, they have a new youth gang.
     It's called the Gilnet Gang. It roams the streets
     of Ann Arbor, acting in secret, and sometimes 
     bypassing the law. They call themselves the Guerillas
     for Good. Some of the things they have done is,
     painted a bridge that was covered with 
     obscenities. They painted it one night. A condemned
     house with - it's popular with neighborhood 
     children, but dangerous, was boarded up. Downtown
     planters unfilled because of a debate over which
     group was responsible, business or government,
     were filled with flowers. A hedge, thought to
     be hampering vision, at busy intersection was
     trimmed, and the owner was angered. Trash along
     a portion of the Huron River was picked up. 
     Members of the gang are anonymous teenagers who ask
     for no individual recognition. Their aim is to
     slice red tape, to get things - good things in
     their opinion - done. The organization has a
     faint religious overtone. It's sort of an 
     ecumenical group, said an assistant professor at
     the University of Michigan who acts as an informal
     sounding board for the gang's ideas. The name
     is from St. Peter, the Fisherman's Net. And it
     is remote enough not to be identified with any
     particular church. There is a thread of Robin
     Rood running through this thing, said their
     teacher, who also prefers to remain anonymous.
     A lot of their activities are extra-legal When the
     system bogs down, they directly administer
     good, rather than go through the red tape 
     channels. The gang is made up of about 55 
     highschool kids, boys and girls, and there's another
     40 or 50 who belonged to the gang before they
     graduated. The idea for the gang evolved from
     a trip to Detroit slum area, where a church
     group - youth group noted the way that street
     gangs operate. They were impressed with the
     methods of operation and decided to organize for
     somewhat different reasons. 'It was the chance
     to do things for the pure sake of giving,' said
     the gang's advisor.

[05:00:58:18]
_page : 4
CC: That is about it as far as the world and national
     news and the features is concerned. On the sport
     page, Hank Stram of the Kansas City Chiefs was
     named as the AFL coach of the year. This is the
     second time for him in three seasons. The voting
     was done by an Associated Press panel of 30 sports
     writers and sportscasters, three from each city.
     The nearest one to him was Weeb Ewbank. Other
     coach's that received votes were Sid Gilman of
     San Diego, and Lou Sabin of Denver. As for the
     Shriners College All Star game yesterday, the
     North cooled the South 3 to 0. Michigan State's
     Dick Berlinsky booted a 23 yard field goal in
     the first quarter and it was all the North needed
     to beat the South Wednesday, in the Shrine's 
     College All Star football game. Let's see, I guess
     the interesting things about this are that first
     downs, North 19, South 16; rushing, North 214,
     South 169; passing was North 96, South 109. So,
     all in all, it looks like they were evenly matched.
     Looks like Parseghian and his Notre Damers weren't
     as strong as ole Howard was worrying about.

[05:00:59:52]
_page : 5
CDR: Roger. We are dumping the water now, Jerry.

[05:00:59:54]
CC: Okay, Frank.

[05:00:59:59]
CC: For the big Astro Blue Bonnet game, the big
     basketball classic followed by the Astro Blue Bonnet
     Bowl in the Dome: SMU and Oklahoma have arrived.
     They are getting ginned up for the big game.
     Doesn't say here which are favored. I will look
     that up and let you know later, if one is favor
     here. The Davis Cup is underway now, down in
     Australia, and the US is bidding to recapture
     that again, and apparently we're favored to 
     recapture the supremacy today. Another item in
     the news, is O. J. Simpson; he was named player
     of the year in college football for the second
     consecutive season by the Walter Camp Football
     Foundation. Woody Hayes, as I told you
     yesterday, was named coach of the year.

     little bit earlier.

[05:01:03:55]
CC: Frank, one other little item in the news here,
     I thought might be interesting is - . Stand by.

[05:01:04:15]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[05:01:04:18]
CDR: Go ahead. You are loud and clear.

[05:01:04:20]
CC: Okay. I got interrupted there for a minute. Bob
     Hope is back out in Viet Nam again with his troops,
     doing a great job as usual. One little name in
     the news story here is from the USS New Jersey.
     Bob Hope joked from atop of a huge gun turret
     yesterday - or Wednesday - to delight the 1500 men
     aboard the battle ship New Jersey on its 20th
     Christmas entertaining US troops abroad. Hope
     and his 27 member troop entertained the New Jersey
     seamen after attending a Christmas mass aboard
     the carrier Hancock, both off Viet Nam. "This
     must be the biggest Cris Craft in the world,"
     Hope told the seamen. "It looks like Wake Island
     with a rudder." "I think it was nice of them to
     take the ship out of mothballs just to give me a
     21-gun salute," he said. Hope joked while 
     standing on one of the ships 16 inch gun turrets. The
     sailors were particularly impressed by a squad
     of long legged girls who came aboard with Hope
     including Actress Ann-Margaret and Miss World.

[05:01:05:28]
_page : 7
CDR: Did you say that was his 20th trip ever there at
     Christmas time, or overseas at Christmas time?

[05:01:05:33]
CC: That's right, it's the 20th time he has been over -
     overseas for Christmas with the troops.

[05:01:05:41]
CDR: He's as old as Jack Benny.

[05:01:05:43]
CC: Roger. Hey, you can turn off the water dump now.

[05:01:05:44]
CDR: We're in the process, or as we say in the
     aerospace business: that's in work.

[05:01:05:58]
CC: Roger. You do good work.

[05:01:06:17]
CC: That other aviator that's going around the world,
     Max Conrad with his light plane - he spent
     Christmas day in the Antarctics - at Puento Aranes in
     Chili; he's waiting for good weather so he can
     continue his flight down to the South Pole. He
     hopes to get around the world. He is going around
     both Poles, and he's going to fly from Palmer to
     Byrd, from Byrd to the South Pole, and then return
     home to the United States by way of New Zealand,
     Australia, and Hawaii.

[05:01:06:50]
_page : 8
CDR: Brother. He had better take some No Doze with him.

[05:01:06:53]
CMP: I tried to talk Frank into the same trip.

[05:01:07:21]
LMP: You can give him a weather report from Apollo 8.
     The South Pole was really clobbered or at least
     it was the other day.

[05:01:07:24]
CC: Roger.

[05:01:07:44]
CC: I don't imagine there are many alternates down
     there.

[05:01:07:49]
CDR: No, I don't think so.

[05:01:07:52]
CDR: We have some pretty clear weather up here.

[05:01:07:55]
CC: No fog, huh?

[05:01:07:59]
CDR: Not outside.

[05:01:08:06]
CDR: Actually, it's snowing outside right now with
     that waste water dump that Bill just did.

[05:01:08:11]
CC: Roger. Does it look a little bit like Christmas?

[05:01:08:15]
CDR: Right.

[05:01:08:29]
CDR: Jerry, do you have a decision about what we are
     going to do about this next midcourse?                                            

[05:01:08:39]
CC: No, Frank. We don't need it.

[05:01:08:44]
CDR: Okay. I just wanted to make sure officially
     we'll scrub MCC 6?

[05:01:08:49]
_page : 9
CC: Affirmative.

[05:01:08:53]
CDR: I guess - Jim said that was already official. I
     was sleeping at the time. I didn't hear it.

[05:01:08:57]
CC: Okay. Frank, by the way, how do you feel about
     your EMS now? You feel like you've got all the
     answers to the little funnies you saw earlier?

[05:01:09:08]
CDR: Yes. The answer is don't turn it into AUTO fast.
     It seems to be very sensitive to jerks, or 
     separation.

[05:01:09:16]
CC: Okay, you, you figure it's all pretty much just
     a switch throwing anomaly and if you play it by
     the numbers and then slow and deliberate you will
     be okay?

[05:01:09:25]
CDR: Yes. Ken, I'm getting razzed up here because I
     said it was sensitive to jerks.

[05:01:09:33]
CC: (Laughter) We thought of that, too, down here.

[05:01:09:37]
CDR: Yes, I figured you did.

[05:01:09:39]
CMP: I told Ken last night at separation after TLI,
     when we separated from the S-IVB, we got a nice
     bang out of the pyros and the EMS jumped over
     100 feet per second.

[05:01:11:20]
CDR: Jerry, do you want to - I've got it in the flight
     plan to start charging our battery B. Do you
     want that started at 100 now also?

[05:01:11:29]
CC: Affirmative, Frank.

[05:01:11:33]
CDR: Okay.

[05:01:11:38]
_page : 10
CC: Frank, we expect it will take about 3 or 4 hours.

[05:01:11:40]
CDR: We're starting it.

[05:01:11:44]
CC: Okay.

[05:01:11:58]
CDR: And we're happy to report the earth is getting
     larger.

[05:01:12:01]
CC: Roger, that's comforting. Looks like you are
     going to make earth instead of Venus, huh?

[05:01:12:05]
CDR: Right.

[05:01:13:08]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Your friendly guidance officer
     has got a LM vector update for you and a CNC time
     update. Over.

[05:01:13:17]
CDR: Okay. We'll go to P00. P00 in ACCEPT.

[05:01:13:29]
CC: Roger.

[05:01:19:56]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. The updates are
     complete. The computer is yours. You can go to
     BLOCK.

[05:01:20:05]
CDR: Roger; BLOCK.

[05:01:20:50]
CDR: Houston. We won't transfer that state vector,
     since we are not going to do that MCC. Is that
     all right?

[05:01:20:58]
CC: Okay. Real fine, Frank.

[05:01:21:03]
CDR: Roger.

[05:01:22:53]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[05:01:22:56]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go.

CDR: Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?

[05:02:31:00]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear.

[05:02:31:03]
CDR: Okay, thank you, we are starting the P23.

[05:02:31:09]
CC: Roger, Frank.

[05:02:32:41]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[05:02:32:44]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:02:32:45]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. We have lost all
     CNC data on you. The last data we had showed a
     high and middle gimbal angle. Over.

[05:02:32:56]
CDR: No. I'm fine. How come you lost those CNC data.

[05:02:33:01]
CC: I think maybe it was just your movement -
     movement out of PTC.

[05:02:33:07]
CDR: I see, fine. Thank you, it was high. I was
     watching it though.

[05:02:33:11]
CC: Okay. We have data now.

[05:02:50:33]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[05:02:50:36]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[05:02:50:39]
CDR: We are noticing our quad A helium tank is
     starting to go up again. You got any ideas on that.

[05:02:50:45]
CC: Yes. We are watching it to, Frank. So far,
     it's still okay and we are talking about it.

[05:02:50:54]
CDR: Okay.

[05:02:51:26]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[05:02:51:30]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:02:51:31]
CC: Roger, Frank, this helium tank in quad A - it looks
     like we may have bothered you up unnecessarily on
     this thing. It appears to be no problem as best
     as we can tell. We got a few of the minds
     together talking about it, and it's been down
     rated quite a bit. Also there - the folks
     down here monitoring the P23 suspect that Jim
     is shooting on star number 22 rather 02, so he
     may be having-some problems.

[05:02:52:01]
_page : 2
CMP: Oh no. We've changed; we are on star 02 on the
     moon.

[05:02:52:07]
CC: Okay.

[05:02:52:25]
CC: Frank, I may have to add some names to my chicken
     list.

[05:02:52:31]
CDR: About what?

[05:02:52:33]
CC: Helium tank A, quad A.

[05:02:52:37]
CDR: Roger. I just don't want to be the one that
     proves the fracture mechanics people are right.

[05:02:52:45]
CC: Roger, Frank.

[05:02:52:54]
CDR: This attitude is going to have us right square
     into the sun, too.

[05:02:53:00]
CC: Roger.

[05:03:22:08]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[05:03:22:13]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:03:22:14]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We are going to need some
     data from your past P23 marks. We missed some
     items, and so don't put it away and when you
     finish this next P23 we'll get It all together.

[05:03:22:27]
_page : 3
CDR: Okay.

[05:03:22:28]
CC: Roger. Got some information for you on this
     PTC that we'll be going to right after this
     next P23 exercise. We'd like you this time to
     try the nose north attitude, that's pitch of 180,
     and a yaw of 315, and also we'd like to give
     another look at this mode free type of PTC and
     we think maybe we'll get a little bit of spin
     stabilization if we try it at 0.3 degrees per
     second on the roll rate rather than 0.1. So
     if you figure on doing that at 124:30 we'll see
     what kind of information we can get out of it.

[05:03:23:14]
CDR: Okay. You know what I think of that, don't you?
     I'll be happy to do it, but I think it's 
     playing games.

[05:03:23:22]
CC: Roger, Frank, you're burning right now 1.4 pounds
     per hour with attitude hold in pitch and yaw.
     We're kind of interested to see if 0.3 degrees
     per second will reduce your RCS usage due to
     spin stabilization.

[05:03:23:40]
CDR: Yes, I know. I predict that it will not.

[05:03:23:45]
CC: Okay.

[05:03:23:48]
CDR: Jerry, I'm a little concerned about the
     temperature. We're getting kind of warm in here, and
     also the evaporator outlet temperature is up
     around 45 degrees. Do you have any trend that
     we're getting less efficient operation of the
     radiators?

[05:03:24:15]
_page : 4
CC: Frank, EECOM says everything looks nominal down
     here. You might try a change in your cabin
     temperature heat exchanger there.

[05:03:24:26]
CDR: No, we don't have the fans on, but what we
     have done is put up a window shade. That
     seems to help it. We've been getting a lot
     more sun in the cabin this way.

[05:03:24:35]
CC: Roger. We'll keep a sharp eye on things and
     keep you posted.

[05:03:24:40]
CDR: Roger. I don't mind playing games because,
     you guys have been very nice in the five and
     a half days. If you want to play games in
     the next half hour, we'll play.

[05:03:24:48]
CC: Roger, Frank.

[05:03:25:09]
CDR: Jim is trying this set with the eye relief
     optics so we can give you some information
     on that.

[05:03:25:15]
CC: Okay.

[05:03:25:49]
CDR: I think it would be very difficult to
     extrapolate anything that you are getting out of
     this bit business to a LM-command module 
     combination, because the spacecraft handles quit
     a bit different just with the change of fuel
     load, including the difference in drifting off
     and roll.

[05:03:26:07]
_page : 5
CC: Roger, Frank. We just got finished discussing
     that, too. We agree with your point of view
     on that one. I think this is more of a curiosity
     thing than anything at all.

[05:03:26:18]
CMP: I think it's fine. No sweat. We don't have
     anything else to do here for about another
     10 hours.

[05:03:26:20]
CC: Okay.

[05:03:26:27]
CMP: Jerry, what I'm kind of curious about is the
     fuel usage. Now with P23 and what we were
     doing, we have a lot more fuel.

[05:03:26:57]
CC: Jim, we'll take a look at that fuel usage bit.
     Right now, the trend looks like it is getting
     better as we would expect with a lighter weight.

[05:03:27:10]
CC: We'll try to get a little more definitive for
     you here.

[05:03:27:14]
CMP: Okay.

[05:03:27:15]
CDR: We really - we shouldn't complain about the
     fuel usage on that SPS engine though, because
     we're sure getting a lot of miles per gallon
     out of it.

[05:03:27:27]
CC: Roger, Frank. Frank, we'll enter you in the
     Shell road test on that.

[05:03:27:29]
CDR: Yes, we don't have any TCP in it, or what is
     that, TCP? Yes. That's the problem. If we'd
     had that, we would have probably used only
     half the fuel.

[05:03:27:47]
_page : 6
CC: Oh, you mean Platformate?

[05:03:27:50]
CDR: That's right, Platformate.

[05:03:28:02]
CDR: If you will get the people to spread out one of
     those banners around the target area, we'll try
     to break it, you know, and coast through it.

[05:03:28:11]
CC: Okay. We'll call some of the paper companies
     and see if they can find a roll big enough.

[05:03:28:17]
CDR: It won't take a big roll, just about 30 feet.

[05:03:28:21]
CC: Roger.

[05:03:28:26]
CMP: Onboard NAV.

[05:03:28:36]
CDR: Tell the doctors that we put William to sleep.

[05:03:28:41]
CC: Roger. You won't leave any scars will you?

[05:03:28:47]
CDR: No. No, he's got his tape recorder with him.

[05:03:29:10]
CDR: Bill said to call Valerie and have her to
     rewind the tape recorder - his tape recorder
     at home.

[05:03:30:55]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[05:03:30:57]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:03:30:58]
CC: I hate to tell you this, Frank, because Jim
     probably won't even be able to wear his COMM
     carrier anymore, but that last set of marks
     put your state vector right on top of the MSFN
     state vector.

[05:03:31:10]
CMP: Come off that, Jerry. Come on; you promised.

[05:03:31:14]
CMP: I'll get you that bottle of brandy when I get
     home, Jerry.

[05:03:31:19]
_page : 7
CDR: Maybe we can get him to go to PROGRAM 01 again
     today, too.

[05:03:31:24]
CC: Roger. That sounds good.

[05:03:32:04]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Also, on the flight plan
     for 124:30, we would like for you to run an
     O2 purge on the fuel cells.

[05:03:32:17]
CDR: Okay.

[05:03:33:24]
CDR: Hey, Jerry. We were going over the checklist
     on entry here, you know?

[05:03:33:28]
CC: Roger, Frank.

[05:03:33:30]
CDR: I've got a question. Is John Harpold around?

[05:03:33:40]
CC: Roger. He is listening.

[05:03:33:44]
CDR: John, I can't remember. Is the lift vector up
     head-down or - -

[05:03:33:59]
CMP: Jerry, I'm beginning to worry up here.

[05:03:34:03]
CC: Roger. It depends on which way your nose is
     pointing.

[05:03:34:08]
CDR: Touche.

[05:03:34:16]
CDR: You might note for the people at MIT that the
     next series of stars will be shot by the master
     navigator with a space helmet on and long eye
     relief eyepieces.

[05:03:34:32]
CC: Roger. That ought to cut his speed down a
     little bit.

[05:03:34:36]
CDR: Right.

[05:03:35:25]
_page : 8
CC: Frank, while you are talking about the entry
     checklist, this cold soak - have you decided
     exactly where you want to do it there prior to
     entry

[05:03:35:37]
CDR: Well, I understood that EECOM talked that over
     with Bill, and we do it 1 hour prior to entry.
     We'll do it wherever you say is the best.

[05:03:35:43]
CC: Okay. One hour is fine. It's just a matter of
     finding time in the time line to do it.

[05:03:35:50]
CDR: I think we can initiate it 1 hour before SEP.

[05:03:35:53]
CC: Okay. Fine. Sounds like a winner.

[05:03:37:06]
CMP: Really got all zeroes with that helmet on.

[05:03:37:09]
CC: Roger. We just noticed that.

[05:03:37:32]
CDR: Jim's going to leave the helmet off now for the
     rest of them, I think; it gets a little anoxic
     in there. These helmets don't have face plates,
     and ye have a difficult time breathing with
     that on.

[05:03:37:44]
CC: Roger.
     END OF TAPE

[05:04:02:26]
_page : 1
_tape : Tape 82
CDR: Okay. Jerry, that completes the P23. Did you
     have something else you want us to do now? You
     wanted to check on something from the last SEP.

[05:04:02:37]
CC: Roger, Frank. We need to get some numbers that
     we weren't able to copy down here. Stand by
     just one. Frank, on your first P23, we missed
     three marks on star number 2. We missed mark
     number 3 trunnion.

[05:04:03:07]
CDR: Okay. three trunnion is 05650.

[05:04:03:11]
CC: Okay, 05650. Then star number 1, mark 2. We
     need the trunnion on that one, too.

[05:04:03:21]
CDR: 04216.

[05:04:03:25]
CC: And on star number 1, mark 3, the DELTA-R and
     DELTA-V.

[05:04:03:31]
CDR: DELTA-R is 00006, DELTA-V 00001.

[05:04:03:38]
CC: Roger. Four balls 6 and four balls 1. Okay.
     Frank, your PTC attitude is pitch 180, yaw 315,
     and roll rate 0.3 degrees per second. The
     reason for wanting to point it north is not
     because we are concerned at all about any changes
     due to venting, there's been, as we can tell,
     no effects on your trajectory by venting. We
     just want to try out that direction on it.

[05:04:04:16]
CDR: That's fine. We are going to stay in for about
     two more seconds while Jim takes the pictures
     through the sextant for the optics people.

[05:04:04:24]
_page : 2
CC: Okay, Frank. And then, also, we are looking for
     a fuel cell O2 purge when you get a chance.

[05:04:04:30]
CDR: That's right. At - I got the word now; it's
     supposed to be at 124:30.

[05:04:04:37]
CC: Right.

[05:04:04:39]
CDR: Okay. We'll do it.

[05:04:11:14]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[05:04:11:17]
CDR: Go ahead.

[05:04:11:18]
CC: Roger. For your P37 that's coming up that you
     are going to run, use a midcourse 7 time of
     144:46. Also just a little note here, the
     trajectory is looking so good, it looks like
     you can make the corridor without even making
     a midcourse 7.

[05:04:11:37]
CDR: Roger. 144:46 for the P37.

[05:04:11:44]
CC: Affirmative.

[05:04:11:47]
CDR: Thank you.

[05:04:13:40]
CMP: Jerry, this is Jim.

[05:04:13:43]
CC: Go ahead, Jim.

[05:04:13:46]
CMP: We are going to set this up for the normal PTC
     mode for a few minutes until Frank gets through
     with the - another step of the call.

[05:04:14:01]
CC: Roger, Jim. When the time is auspicious, would
     you shift the BIOMED switch over to left side?

[05:04:14:09]
CMP: I think we ought to shift it over right now.

[05:04:14:12]
CC: Okay. No, they say hold it up for a little while.

[05:04:14:15]
_page : 3
CMP: ... so you can see, the same data that Dr. Berry
     got on me in Gemini VII is also good for Frank
     on Apollo 8.

[05:04:14:33]
CC: Roger. He heard that.

[05:04:19:25]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8. - -

     went through P37, 1302?

[05:04:19:35]

[05:04:19:39]
CMP: I'll run through it again and see what happens
     here.

[05:04:19:41]

[05:04:21:33]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[05:04:21:36]
CMP: Go ahead.

[05:04:21:37]
CC: Looks like you loaded the wrong time in P37,
     You should load 144:46 for your midcourse time;
     looks like.you loaded 146:46.

[05:04:21:46]
CMP: Okay. I'm sorry. Yes, I have it here. I
     wrote it down, 146:46. Okay.

[05:04:21:55]
CC: Roger.

[05:04:21:57]
CMP: I guess the best way to terminate this is by
     going back to P00, is that right?

[05:04:22:00]
CC: Affirmative.

[05:04:28:02]
CMP: Houston, Apollo 8. It looks like a plus 2.8 foot
     per second correction at midcourse 7.

     183:15, and I'll start that three-tenths of a

     you.

[05:04:41:42]
CC: Roger, Frank. Thanks.

[05:04:41:55]

     rolling now.

[05:04:41:57]
CC: Roger.

[05:04:42:16]

     of them gets outside of 15 degrees from the
     nominal values, we'll call it off.

[05:04:42:32]
CDR: Okay.

[05:04:45:00]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. I would like to have the
     BIOMED switch left now, if you can.

[05:04:45:09]

[05:04:50:55]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[05:04:50:58]

     offset PTC attitude, so you can go to attitude
     HOLD in pitch and yaw.

[05:04:51:05]

     even get around once, did we?

[05:04:51:09]

     stabilization.

[05:04:51:15]

     0.5 to 0.2 degree per second.

[05:04:51:51]
CDR: I think there is the phenomena known as inertial
     coupling that has something to do with that, huh?

[05:04:51:57]

     the MSFN vectors, we get a minus 1.4 on that
     midcourse compared to your 2.8. we ran your
     solutions through our computer and we also get
     a 2.8, so your P37 looks good. We are busy still
     fiddling with the vectors and comparing them and
     we'll keep an eye on the difference.

[05:04:53:03]
CMP: Roger. It looks like we came up with a plus 2.8
     though, and you say you came out with a minus 
     2.something.

[05:04:53:10]
CC: Affirmative.

[05:04:53:28]
CC: Jim, that 4 feet per second difference is worth
     0.28 degrees on the flight path angle.

[05:04:53:35]
CMP: Roger. Thank you.

[05:05:07:15]
CC: Roger, Frank. How is your cabin temperature
     looking now?

[05:05:07:20]
CDR: It's getting cooler, thank you. We put those
     shades up, and that really helps.

[05:05:07:22]
CC: Okay. The primary loop down here still looks real
     good, so it looks like you are in fine shape. Your
     battery B charge ought to be done by about 127 hours,
     and we think you shouldn't even try to charge
     battery A, since it looks like, at entry interface, it
     is going to have 38 amp-hours on it.

[05:05:07:45]
CDR: I'll tell Bill that.

[05:05:07:47]
CC: Okay

[05:05:08:48]
CDR: How is the weather down there, Jerry?

[05:05:08:52]
CC: That's loud and clear.

[05:05:08:55]
CDR: Cold?

[05:05:08:57]
CC: No, it's pretty balmy around here today.

[05:05:09:13]
CC: Yes, the temperature is about in the 70's here.
     It's a real nice day.

[05:05:09:22]
CDR: Fine.

[05:05:09:54]
CDR: Say, Jerry, last night, Jim was saying something
     about turning on VHF Simplex A about 20 00 miles
     out. I wrote it down, but I can't seem - I can't
     remember where I put it. ...

[05:05:10:11]
CC: Roger, Frank. We've got it in the checklist here
     as right around 4 minutes - 4 hours before EI,
     right after your nominal P23, P37 onboard 
     comparisons, KG-1, page E-1.

[05:05:30:04]

[05:05:30:07]
CC: Roger. We're showing some garbage on your
     computer. If you will hit ERROR RESET, we can
     clear that PROGRAM ALARM so the next one can be
     identified. Over.

[05:05:30:15]
CDR: We don't have any PROGRAM ALARM.

[05:05:30:18]
CC: I think this - this is a carryover from your
     last PROGRAM ALARM there on that P37.

[05:05:30:23]
CDR: Okay. ERROR RESET. Thank you.

CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[05:06:38:31]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[05:06:38:33]
CC: Roger. Your battery is full; you can terminate
     charging. You've got 40 amp-hours on it now,
     and we've got a couple of requests for data
     here.

[05:06:38:41]
CDR: Roger.

[05:06:38:42]
CC: - - requests.

[05:06:38:45]
CDR: Okay. We were just talking about that. I tell
     Bill stop. Okay. What are your requests?

[05:06:38:52]
CC: The first one is - the first time somebody is
     down in the equipment bay, we would like to get
     another reading on your RCS temperatures - those
     six temp meter readings - -

[05:06:39:00]
CDR: Okay.

[05:06:39:02]
CC: - - and the other one is of the boys in the
     back - -

[05:06:39:04]
CDR: We just read them again.

[05:06:39:05]
CC: Beg your pardon?

[05:06:39:06]
CDR: We just read the RCS thruster temperatures again,
     and they are all pegged high.

[05:06:39:14]
CC: Okay. Good deal, Frank. The other one is - the
     boys in the back room would like some time when
     everybody is awake - if you would fire up both
     cabin fans for about 5 minutes, they would like
     to see what the DELTA temperature is on the 
     telemetry when you get the stagnation broken down and
     get some flow going over it. So if you can see
     your way clear to do that, we would like to see
     it same time when everybody is up.

[05:06:39:43]
_page : 2
CMP: We had that running before in the flight. Did
     they check it then?

[05:06:39:49]
CC: You mean early in the game, when you were cool?

[05:06:39:52]
CDR: Yes. When we were cool. Right.

[05:06:39:55]
CC: Yes. They got that data, and they were kind of
     interested in seeing what it looks like when the
     cabin is nice and warm and the temperature 
     indicator is reading on the high side, to see how
     the DELTA works in the other direction.

[05:06:40:07]
CDR: Okay. Coming on.

[05:06:40:08]
CC: Okay. Thank you.

[05:06:40:22]
CDR: What else, Jerry?

[05:06:40:25]
CC: That's it, Frank.

[05:06:40:30]
CC: Another thing, Frank, is we just want to remind
     you that there is no charge needed on A battery.

[05:06:40:36]
CDR: Hey, listen, these cabin fans - one of them
     sounds like it's got a bad bearing. We are 
     going to turn it off. It's got a real squeal to it.

[05:06:40:42]
CC: Okay, Frank.

[05:06:40:45]
_page : 3
CDR: Sounds like it's got something in it.

[05:06:40:50]
CC: That must be Bill's teddy bear.

[05:06:40:54]
CDR: Say again.

[05:06:40:55]
CC: That must be Bill's teddy bear.

[05:06:40:59]
CDR: I don't know, but there is something in there.

[05:06:41:46]
CDR: We will try them again, one at a time, and see
     if we can determine which one's got the noise.

[05:06:41:50]
CC: Roger.

[05:06:42:15]
CDR: Number 2 is really bad. It's got a bad bearing,
     and it whines like mad, so we are not going to
     turn it on.

[05:06:42:22]
CC: Roger. Thank you.

[05:06:42:26]
CDR: We are not going to try number 1 either; there
     may have - something might have got in both of
     than, Jerry.

[05:06:42:31]
CC: Okay, Frank. That's fine.

[05:06:42:46]
CDR: Sounds like that MG starter of yours.

[05:06:42:55]
CC: I'm afraid to turn my starter on now. It's been
     so long.

[05:07:14:39]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go.

[05:07:14:42]
CDR: Roger. We would leave the PTC long enough to
     go orient toward the earth for a TV shot to
     see if this TV thing is going off on 128.

[05:07:15:20]
CC: Roger, Frank. That is fine. Do you have the
     gimbal angles you need?

[05:07:15:26]
CDR: Yes, thank you. I got them earlier today.

[05:07:15:29]
CC: Okay.

[05:07:15:43]
CDR: I'd like to keep this one kind of short because
     we're trying to get some sleep earlier than
     yesterday.

[05:07:15:52]

     garbled.

[05:07:16:03]
CDR: How is that antenna?

[05:07:16:05]
CC: Loud and clear, Frank.

[05:07:16:07]

     to hurry things up a little bit to see if we can
     get as much sleep as possible.

[05:07:16:15]
CC: Roger.

[05:07:16:38]

     switch on the right side now, please?

[05:07:16:44]

[05:07:16:50]
CC: Frank, do you intend to start your TV before

     that is what it was all squared away for.

[05:07:17:10]
CC: Affirmative.

[05:07:18:22]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Are you planning on using
     the wide angle lens?

[05:07:18:28]
CDR: I think that would be best.

[05:07:18:31]
CC: Okay. Jack says you want to be sure and use
     the red filter and the filter holder for that
     One. It takes a little darker filter.

[05:07:18:40]
CDR: Okay.

[05:07:18:57]
CDR: Do you want to take both red filters on there
     or just the one for the one for the filter holder?

[05:07:19:10]
CC: He thinks just the red one on the filter holder
     will do, but might not hurt to have the other
     one ready, just in case.

[05:07:19:38]
CDR: How about if we use the telephoto? It will be
     a little harder to focus, but it might end up
     a better picture.

[05:07:19:52]
CC: Roger, Frank. If you want to use the telephoto
     lens, you ought to use the same combination you
     used going out, the 25A.

[05:07:20:02]

     hurry up the voyage home by calling up
     PROGRAM 01 to get us back on the PAD, but it
     didn't work.

[05:07:41:35]
CMP: Roger. This is one of those rare occasions
     where Bill left his seat and I am now sitting
     in it, and for the first time, I can see the

     pretty nice.

[05:07:41:57]

     it was clear.

[05:07:42:06]
CMP: Well, we could see South America and Florida and
     through the lower part of the U.S. Looks like
     there is a weather front going over into the
     central part of the United States, lot of clouds
     over the northwest area. Florida is clear; it
     looks like the east coast is pretty clear.

[05:07:42:24]

[05:07:42:30]

CC: The earth is on now, Frank.

[05:07:46:04]
CDR: How's it look?

[05:07:46:06]
CC: We are seeing about half of it. You moved in
     the wrong direction. Okay. It's coming back,
     a little more. Good, now a shade toward the
     terminator.

[05:07:46:30]
CC: A little bit more toward the terminator and in
     the same direction you were moving it before.
     Right; you have got it centered right in the
     middle.

[05:07:47:01]
CC: Now move it away from the terminator just a
     bit.

[05:07:47:11]
CC: Good picture.

[05:07:47:15]
CDR: Okay. You want us to wait until 128, right?

[05:07:47:19]
CC: Affirmative. Frank, move your camera to the
     right; I want to see which way the earth moves
     on my screen.

[05:07:47:30]
CC: Okay. Moving your camera to the right moves the
     earth to the left on our screen. On our screen,
     the terminator is almost parallel to the 
     horizontal direction, and the dark part is on the
     top.

[05:07:47:52]
CDR: Okay. We will turn it back on at 128, then.

[05:07:47:55]

[05:07:49:40]
LMP: Roger. We're just trying something - -

[05:07:52:59]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. You are in the scan limit
     right now on the high-gain antenna; although you
     may have NARROW beam width selected, you are in
     WIDE. To improve the situation would take a
     pitch down and a yaw left, and we will have FAO
     check it and give you some angles if we need
     to change it.

[05:07:53:22]
CDR: We just got out of the scan limit by pitching
     up and yawing right.

[05:07:53:40]
CC: Roger. You are right, Frank.

[05:07:53:45]

     band now?

[05:08:01:21]
CC: Roger. The picture is on the lower right hand
     of our screen.

[05:08:01:30]

     and to the right.

[05:08:01:50]

     worse; now it's coming in

[05:08:01:59]
CMP: Are you getting it now, Jerry?

[05:08:02:01]
CC: Roger. We've got most of it; keep moving off
     to the right. Good. You have it centered
     right now.

[05:08:02:11]
CMP: Well, the earth looks a little bigger to us
     today, not much, but it's somewhat bigger. I'm
     sitting over in the right hand seat now; Bill
     has got the TV camera; Frank is helping him out
     aiming it directly to hit the earth. I hope
     we have a good picture. Can you see the clouds?

[05:08:02:28]
CC: Affirmative. We sure can. Move it up toward
     the terminator - correction, away from the 
     terminator just a shade.

[05:08:02:38]
_page : 9
CMP: At the tip of South America, there is a great
     swirl of clouds down there. It looks like a
     great storm. I wonder if you can see it.

[05:08:02:45]
CC: Roger. We see a large swirl just south of the
     terminator.

[05:08:02:52]
CMP: Roger. And then up to the left hand side, or
     towards the north, we can see the light waters
     around the West Indies, and we can actually see
     Florida. I'm looking through Bill's monocular, 
     and I can see the various land masses, South
     America and the central part and southern part
     of the United States.

[05:08:03:11]
CC: Roger. Move-a little bit away from the
     terminator now, a little left with the camera and a
     little further from the terminator.

[05:08:03:27]
CMP: Say it again, Jerry.

[05:08:03:30]
CC: Okay. You're moving it toward the center of the
     screen now, and the earth is off on the left side
     of our screen.

[05:08:03:40]
CC: Real fine. That's good. Hold it right there.

[05:08:03:56]
CMP: What we're thinking about right now, Jerry, is
     hitting that wedge angle, about 2 degrees their
     limit. When we come back, the earth looks pretty
     small right from here.

[05:08:04:06]
CC: Roger.

[05:08:04:10]
CMP: You got it, Bill.

[05:08:04:22]
_page : 10
LMP: As I look down on the earth here from so far out
     in space, I think I must have the feeling that
     the travelers in the old sailing ships used to
     have: going on a very long voyage away from
     home, and now we're headed back, and I have that
     feeling of being proud of the trip, but still -
     still happy to be going back home and back to
     our home port. And that's - that's what you're
     seeing right here.

[05:08:04:50]
CC: Roger, Bill. We'll sure be glad to get you
     back, too.

[05:08:04:59]
CDR: This is Frank Borman. We've enjoyed the
     television shows, and we'd like you to stay tuned in
     in the future because there'll be flights and
     rendezvous and earth orbit, and then, of course,
     there'll be television from the lunar surface
     itself in the not too far distant future. So,
     until then, I guess this is the Apollo 8 crew
     signing off, and we'll see you back on that
     good earth very soon.

[05:08:05:27]
CC: Roger, Frank. Adios.

CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[05:08:06:57]
CMP: Go ahead.

[05:08:06:58]

     attitude that's easiest to fly to.

[05:08:11:28]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[05:08:11:30]
CC: Roger. Your PTC attitude ought to be either
     a 1045 or a 18315. We'd recommend 18315. That
     will keep your windows out of the sun.

[05:08:11:42]
CDR: 180, that's right. I got them mixed up, didn't
     I? It's 18315.

[05:08:11:46]
CC: Roger.

[05:08:17:03]
CDR: Okay, Jerry ...

[05:08:17:15]
CC: Apollo 8, this is Houston. You're unreadable
     due to background noise. Over.

[05:08:17:23]
CDR: How now, Jerry?

[05:08:17:25]
CC: Loud and clear.

[05:08:17:27]
CDR: I say we're starting to stow the spacecraft and
     get all squared away and then be sleeping and
     eating. We'll be all thinking about entry from
     now on.

[05:08:17:34]
CC: Roger, Frank. And now that Bill's up, we'd like
     to get a redundant components check.

[05:08:17:40]
CDR: Alright. He's putting helmets in the food boxes.
     Just a minute, I'll get him to do it for you.

[05:08:17:45]
CC: Roger. There is no great hurry, Frank. We're
     - -

[05:08:17:47]
CDR: Roger.

[05:08:17:49]
CC: We're mostly interested in looking at the
     secondary loop.

[05:08:17:54]
_page : 12
CDR: That's what I was going to say. I can't see
     any reason to check anything other than the
     secondary loop, can you?

[05:08:17:58]
CC: That's affirmative.

[05:08:18:08]
CDR: Now in that cabin cold soak, we won't have any
     cabin fans.

[05:08:18:13]
CC: Roger. I understand.

[05:08:19:52]
CMP: Jerry, this is Apollo 8.

[05:08:19:54]
CC: Apollo 8, go.

[05:08:19:57]
CMP: Roger. I just got on the sextant and now looking
     at Texas, and the weather man is right, it looks
     like a pretty good day. Full of clouds down
     there, but not bad.

[05:08:20:06]
CC: Real fine, Jim. Can you see the kids out in
     the yard waving?

[05:08:20:14]
CMP: Would you tell Pete Conrad to get his kids off
     my roof?

[05:08:20:16]
CC: Wilco.

[05:08:20:22]
CC: Jim, do you see the bright spot out in the
     Pacific Ocean through the sextant?

[05:08:20:31]
CMP: I'll try. We saw it, of course, through the
     windows and through the monocular. I'll see
     if I can spot it.

[05:08:20:37]
CC: Roger.

[05:08:21:32]
CMP: Yes, Jerry, I can see the bright spot. It's -
     I guess it's the subsolar point. It's off of
     South America, it appears to me.  It is a grayish
     spot compared to the blue waters surrounding it.
     It's undefined in diameter, though I mean, it's
     not a clear round spot at all; it's just a
     raggedy one.

[05:08:21:53]
_page : 13
CC: Roger. That showed up real well on the TV's
     picture.

[05:08:22:12]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We'd like to delay that
     request for a secondary loop check to a little
     better point as far as thrusting is concerned.

[05:08:22:22]

[05:08:22:27]

[05:08:24:10]

[05:08:24:13]

[05:08:24:14]

     the viewing room.

[05:08:24:20]

[05:08:24:28]
CMP: Oh, well, good. Say hello to her for me.

[05:08:24:31]
CC: Yes, and she's got a few troops with her,
     too.

[05:08:24:38]

[05:08:24:41]

[05:08:32:42]
CC: Roger. Before Bill falls asleep, we'd like to
     have him go ahead and do that secondary EVAP
     check now at any time at his convenience, and
     if we don't happen to be able to monitor it
     with high bit rate, just let us know when you
     did it.

[05:08:48:09]
LMP: Good afternoon, Jerry.

[05:08:48:11]
CC: Howdy.

[05:08:48:14]
LMP: Okay. Somebody said something about checking
     out the evaporator - evaporators. What do you
     want to do?

[05:08:48:20]
CC: Roger. Before we get too far along, we'd like
     to see, essentially with the secondary 
     evaporator check, what we got on the redundant 
     components check.

[05:08:48:31]
LMP: Okay. Stand by.

[05:08:48:33]
CC: Roger. EECOM says to be sure and let it go for
     at least 5 minutes.

[05:08:48:39]
LMP: Roger. Now you want to check out the primary
     evaporator also, or did you decide it's not
     necessary?

[05:08:48:46]
CC: I guess they decided it's not necessary, Bill.

[05:08:48:52]
LMP: Okay.

[05:08:49:31]
LMP: Okay. Secondary glycol loops coming on the line.

[05:08:49:34]
CC: Roger, Bill.

[05:08:49:59]

[05:08:50:02]

CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go.

[05:08:53:48]
LMP: Alright. What do you have in mind here in the
     way of activating the secondary loop prior to
     separation? It looks like if we do have a cabin
     fan problem, we won't be able to do a full-blown
     coldsoak. Is there anything that we can do that'll
     do any good?

[05:08:54:05]
CC: Well, right now, Bill, in the checklist, we're
     showing this activation at about minus 1 hour.
     Let me check with EECOM for R minute and see if
     they got any more words considering the cabin
     fan situation.

[05:08:54:19]
LMP: Roger.

[05:08:54:59]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Looks like a good time. One
     hour before SEP - entry interface would be fine.

[05:08:55:10]
LMP: Okay. It won't do any good, then, to fool around
     with these cabin temp valves. ...

[05:08:55:21]
CC: Bill, stand by. You're - got a lot of background
     noise.

[05:08:55:39]
CC: Go ahead now, Bill.

[05:08:55:40]
LMP: Read me now, Jerry?

[05:08:55:41]
CC: Loud and clear.

[05:08:55:45]
LMP: Okay. This coldsoak is built around the premise
     that you've got a cabin heat exchanger, in my
     view; and if you haven't got a cabin heat 
     exchanger, I'm wondering just what you can do.

[05:08:56:02]
_page : 3
CC: He's thinking.

[05:08:56:28]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. We think it'll still do a
     little bit of good so we'd just as soon go through
     with it.

[05:08:56:39]
LMP: Okay. Even bypassing the suit heat exchanger and
     that part of it too, huh?

[05:08:56:44]
CC: That's affirmative.

[05:08:56:48]
LMP: Okay.

[05:08:56:49]
CC: Also, Bill, your secondary loop is looking good.

[05:08:56:54]

LMP: Hey, Jerry. when do you want to crank up the VHF,
     anyway?

[05:09:08:26]
CC: Roger. VHF Simplex - well, we had that on the
     checklist for about minus 4 hours.

[05:09:08:37]
LMP: Okay. We wanted - we wanted to put it out prior
     to MAX range, don't you think? Get an idea of
     when we're picking it up?

[05:09:08:50]

     it.

[05:09:22:46]
CMP: Oh, it's Michael Collins, is it? Good morning to
     you.

[05:09:22:50]
CC: Righto. And we're looking at your pitch CDU
     readout down here and looks to us like you are about
     25 degrees off the 180 for your PTC, and we were
     just wondering how come?

[05:09:23:03]
CMP: We've been looking at that, too. It keeps
     wandering off in pitch for some reason more than yaw.
     I was just about ready to go back to it again. I
     had to go back one time, and I was just seeing
     how far she would drift. I thought it would drift
     out a ways and come back by itself, but it is not
     doing it.

[05:09:23:18]
CC: Okay.

[05:09:23:21]
CMP: We'll get back there.

     just fine.

[05:09:34:18]

     know how our thermal control was going before
     we left.

[05:09:35:18]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[05:09:35:20]
CC: Your temperatures are looking good, Frank. There
     is still a differential temperature between quads,
     but nothing that would cause us in the slightest
     to worry about doing P23.

[05:09:35:31]
CDR: Roger. Understand.

[05:09:47:22]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[05:09:47:27]
CMP: Go ahead.

[05:09:47:28]
CC: Roger, Jim. We've been looking at these stars
     that we gave you this time for P23. It looks
     like the second star, number 11, has a trunnion
     angle right out to the limit, about 49.7 degrees.
     And we're thinking it might be a good idea to
     switch you over to star 1, which has a much 
     smaller trunnion angle. What do you think? Star 1
     is Alpheratz.

[05:09:47:54]
_page : 6
CMP: Fine with me; I would just as soon take star 1.

[05:09:47:58]
CC: Okay. That will be then in place of star 11,
     star 1, and in place of lunar far horizon, lunar
     near horizon; and it remains two sets. Over.

[05:09:48:12]
CMP: Roger. Star 1, lunar near horizon, two sets.

[05:09:48:15]

[05:10:14:01]
CC: Roger. Fine. Old golden fingers there is
     getting so swift we missed some marks on the 
     downlink. I wonder - if you hand recorded them,
     could you read us your three marks - trunnion
     angles, your three trunnion angles on star 2
     and the last four trunnion angles on star 1.
     Over.

[05:10:14:30]

[05:10:14:32]

     we'll wait until you get a better OMNI.

[05:10:14:38]
CDR: That ought to be a good one.

[05:10:14:40]
_page : 7
CC: That is a good one. That's loud and clear.

[05:10:14:43]
CDR: Okay. Star 2 trunnion angle, first one 05245,
     second one 05243, next one 05241; last 4 
     trunnion angles 04133, 04133, 04132, 04132.

[05:10:15:07]

[05:10:15:25]

     the midcourse that we might need, and all that
     good stuff, Mike?

[05:10:15:30]

CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Over.

[05:10:17:58]
CDR: Go ahead, Mike.

[05:10:18:00]
CC: Okay. We're predicting at the nominal time of
     your next midcourse, which is entry interface
     minus 2 hours - we're predicting 1.4 foot per
     second burn which changes your gamma at entry
     interface by a tenth of a degree. Right now
     with no further maneuvers, your gamma is
     minus 6.39 degrees, and we're going to steepen
     it up very slightly to hit the center of the
     target line, and it will be after the maneuver
     minus 6.51. over.

[05:10:18:35]
CDR: Very good.

[05:10:18:38]
CC: Anything else you want like that?

[05:10:18:42]
CDR: No. I just wondered - we hadn't heard whether
     we were going to do it or not and so on.

[05:10:18:48]
CC: Roger.

[05:10:18:52]
CDR: When we get the PAD data, we'll get it all out
     here.

[05:10:18:58]
CC: Yes. We'll be sending the PAD data up to you
     in about another 2 hours, Frank; about 132 hours 
     GET.

[05:10:19:06]
CDR: Okay. We - this will be the last set of star
     sightings we do now nominally, and even if we
     lose COMM, we'll just come on in with what we got.

[05:10:19:19]
CC: Okay, Frank.

[05:10:19:22]
_page : 2
CDR: Incidentally, that COMM has been fantastic.
     I don't know how you've heard us, but boy, it's
     just like you are next door even in lunar
     distances.

[05:10:19:31]
CC: Yes. It has really been great with rare
     exceptions when you are on a bad OMNI right before
     you switch. Then we get an awful lot of 
     background noise, but in general, it has been 
     excellent, and boy, we are really thankful for it
     because reading all these updates would be
     bad news with bad COMM, as you know.

[05:10:19:48]
CDR: Right.

[05:10:19:50]
CMP: Say, Mike, have you noticed the confidence the
     Captain has in his navigator?

[05:10:19:56]
CC: He hasn't called you Goldfinger yet.

[05:10:20:00]
CMP: NO. He is disregarding anything I can do.
     We're coming in anyway.

[05:10:20:13]

[05:10:20:18]
CMP: Well, back to the drawing board.

[05:10:20:21]

     Bill sleeping now, and then Jim and I will
     swap just as soon as we get through with these
     stars.

[05:10:56:45]
CC: Roger, Frank. If you get a chance to, we'd
     like for you to read us down your trunnion 
     calibration number. We missed that one on the 
     downlink, and we have an update for your passive
     thermal control attitude.

[05:10:56:56]
CDR: Okay. The trunnion calibrations were all zeros.

[05:10:57:00]
CC: Roger. Thank you, and on page 2-104 the PTC
     attitudes should read zero pitch and 45 degrees
     yaw. Over.

[05:10:57:14]
CDR: Zero pitch and 45 degrees at 2-104.

[05:10:57:17]

     those of you who are up and around.

[05:10:57:57]

[05:10:58:01]

     to get your PRD reading while we've got you up

[05:11:35:14]
CC: Okay,Jim. On page 2-107, we're recommending
     that you delete that P52 and just-stay in PTC
     attitude. Your platform is real good, and we
     don't feel that alignment's necessary. One is
     coming up again at 139 hours anyway. And also,
     on that same page, we'd like to delete the
     "begin cabin cold soak." Over. 

[05:11:35:44]
CMP: Righto. Will delete the "begin cabin cold
     soak," and we'll delete the P52.

CC: Roger, Jim. In your computer, we'd like to do
     an erasable memory dump again, like we did the

     when you did that P37 about 8 hours ago, and you
     remember you put that EI time for TIG and got
     that P00 do thing; we'd like to - We don't
     think there's anything in the world wrong with
     it. We think everything is just perfect inside
     the computer, but we'd like to do an erasable
     dump as we did the other day; go through it
     bit by bit. Give us something to do down here.

     then read out register 1, and that register 1
     should be 10 000. And then if it's not, I can
     give you procedures for getting it to 10 000.
     If it is 10 000 as we expect, then VERB 74
     ENTER, and that will do the dump. Over.

[05:12:36:22]
CC: And, Apollo 8, you can do the first part of
     that now at your convenience to verify that
     register 1 is reading 10 000, but would you
     hold up on the dump itself until we get our
     ground stations configured, please. Over.

[05:12:36:38]

     hearing here for a couple of calls. How do you
     read me?

[05:14:38:09]
LMP: I had my hands full; I was putting something
     down. I read you fine.

[05:14:38:20]
CC: Okay. Understand. If it'll be any help to you
     in your PTC driving, we've computed that as you
     look out plus X in the COAS or just out the 
     window, you should be pointed right at Acrux when
     you're in a perfect PTC attitude. We don't know
     if that's a help to you or not, but we thought
     you might enjoy trying an alternate mode of 
     keeping the attitude under control.

[05:14:38:40]
LMP: Okay. From my present position, we're going to
     have to move Acrux a little bit.

[05:14:38:50]
CC: Well, whatever you think. We just thought you
     might appreciate knowing.

     anyway.

LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. Do you read?

[05:14:40:59]
CC: Go ahead, Bill.

[05:14:41:02]
LMP: Actually, Mike, it's so easy to do it with the
     eight-ball within a reasonable sloppy limit that
     it's hardly worth the trouble to scootch way up
     in the seat to look out the COAS, and it's enough
     light in the cockpit where the star really isn't
     too easy to see. So I'm kind of inclined to use
     the IFR technique here where you can see the rest
     of the instrument panel.

[05:14:41:27]
CC: Okay.

[05:14:41:41]
LMP: I thought you were an all-weather pilot.

[05:14:41:44]

     get a "Got Ya" on CAP COMM and FAO.

LMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[05:19:19:13]
CC: Apollo 8, we'd like to have you, before you get
     in a P52 going here, we'd like to have you rezero
     the optics and read us the mechanical CDU's.
     We're trying to collect a little data for
     troubleshooting.

[05:19:19:29]
LMP: Roger. Stand by.

[05:19:19:31]
CC: Thank you.

[05:19:19:45]
LMP: What's the trouble you are trying to troubleshoot?

[05:19:19:51]
CC: This goes back to some of the problems we had
     prior to LOI; trying to see if the software
     readouts we're getting down here compare with the
     mechanical readouts. It's not a current problem
     as far as we know.

[05:19:20:08]
LMP: Okay.

[05:19:21:27]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[05:19:21:31]
LMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[05:19:21:33]
CC: Okay. Why don't you just read me the mechanical
     CDU's there now, and then it looks from the ground
     like you're clear to go ahead with the P52.

[05:19:21:44]
_page : 3
LMP: Okay. We'll get the navigator squared away here
     in just a minute.

[05:19:21:51]
CMP: Good morning, Captain.

[05:19:21:53]
CC: Good morning, sir.

[05:19:21:57]
CMP: This will be a piece of stew out of a deep sleep.
     Okay, stand by one.

[05:19:22:17]
CMP: Trunnion mechanical CDU looks like it's reading
     about 1/100.

[05:19:22:25]
CC: Roger.

[05:19:22:52]
CMP: And the shaft mechanical CDU looks like it is reading
     about 4/100 below zero, which would be about 364.
     Yes.

[05:19:23:12]
CC: Understand, Jim. That is 4/100 below zero on
     that shaft; is that affirm?

[05:19:23:17]
CMP: Yes. Stand by one. About 35996 on the shaft.

[05:19:23:27]
CC: Okay. Thank you. You can go ahead with P52 now.

[05:19:23:35]
CMP: Okay.

[05:19:25:36]
LMP: I always said he did better in his sleep.

[05:19:26:28]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[05:19:26:32]
LMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[05:19:26:34]
CC: Okay. It looks like we're getting down on the
     service module RCS to the place where we ought to
     go ahead and activate the secondary service module
     RCS propellant.

[05:19:26:48]
LMP: Okay. Stand by.

[05:19:28:30]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[05:19:28:34]
_page : 4
LMP: Go ahead.

[05:19:28:36]
CC: Okay. We've got a new PTC attitude. For the
     pitch 180, and the yaw 315.

[05:19:28:45]
LMP: Roger. Yaw 315.

[05:19:28:48]
CC: Roger. And pitch 180.

[05:19:28:52]
LMP: Okay.

[05:19:28:57]
LMP: Can't you pick one a little further away?

[05:19:29:32]
CC: Not in our normal sphere.

[05:19:29:48]
CMP: Ken, this is Jim.

[05:19:29:51]
CC: Go ahead.

[05:19:29:52]
CMP: Aren't we still a little high on the quantity
     side to activate the secondary?

[05:19:30:01]
CC: Negative. We have quad Bravo and quad Delta which
     are getting right down, according to the calculated
     numbers, next to where we ought to be activating
     them. The numbers you are reading are going to
     be a little bit high, but the computer data on
     the ground shows that you have about 134 pounds
     in Bravo and Delta, and about 130 pounds is where
     you ought to be on the secondary.

[05:19:30:33]
CMP: Okay. Roger. We will activate the secondary and
     turn off the primary.

[05:19:30:40]
CC: Okay. It's just to keep you from running one of
     them up.

[05:20:28:17]
CDR: Ken, on this maneuver, MCC 7, are you going to -
     are we going to burn the PAD data that we got
     some time ago, or is there a new maneuver coming
     up, or what's going on in that regard?

[05:20:28:35]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. If required, we'll give you a
     new one. Right now, we are looking at not making
     a maneuver burn at all.

[05:20:28:46]
CDR: You say we may not even have another one now?

[05:20:28:48]
CC: That's right.

[05:20:29:04]

CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[05:20:35:50]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[05:20:35:52]
CC: Okay. Read you loud and clear now. Just wanted
     to remind you that in the event of a loss of
     COMM, we don't want you to burn MCC 7. Your
     present entry PAD is good. We'll be updating
     your landing points at the same time that you would
     have gotten MCC 7, and I'd like to have a crew
     status report from you when it's convenient.

[05:20:36:38]
_page : 2
CDR: Okay, Ken. I understand. If we would lose COMM,
     you do not want us to burn MCC 7, just go ahead
     and use the entry PAD you've given us?

[05:20:36:46]
CC: That's affirmative. You'll be within 0.06 degrees
     of your entry angle target line.

[05:20:36:54]
CDR: Alright. The crew status is everybody has gotten
     real good rest last night, and everybody is in
     good shape. Jim is just waking up, and Bill is
     starting the initial stowage, and we all feel very
     well.

[05:20:37:12]
CC: Okay.

[05:20:37:17]
CC: Okay. And we'd like to - guess we need a PRD
     reading from you. And we'll be needing one in
     the neighborhood of 145-hour period, somewhere
     when it's convenient in there again.

[05:20:45:20]
CDR: Houston, Apollo 8.

[05:20:45:24]

     our velocity and range from the earth now?

[05:20:45:50]
CC: Stand by.

[05:20:46:59]
CC: Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. At time 51, your
     velocity will be 9526, altitude 42946. Over.

[05:21:34:17]

[05:21:34:22]
CDR: Negative, this is Apollo 8. We did not call you.

[05:21:34:25]
CC: Okay. Thank you.

[05:21:34:29]
CDR: Roger.

[05:21:41:31]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston.

[05:21:41:34]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.

[05:21:41:37]
CC: Okay. I've got some weather and recovery force
     status and a couple of last minute items to run
     down any time it is convenient for you.

[05:21:41:47]
CDR: Alright. It's convenient right now, any time.

[05:21:41:50]
CC: Okay. For the mid-Pacific, the general condition
     is good. You can expect cloud bases 2000 foot
     scattered, visibility 10 miles, wind 070 at 12,
     wave heights 4 feet, altimeter 2974. Sunrise
     will be 17:10 Zulu, and first light 16:49 Zulu.
     The recovery forces: ship will be Yorktown; the
     aircraft will be Airboss number 1 and 2, and
     Recoveries 1, 2, and 3. The estimated time to a
     target point: the ship is - Yorktown is on the
     target point, Airboss aircraft 15 minutes and will
     be on-scene commander. Recoveries 1, 2, and 3
     are SH3 Alfas, and they go with the Yorktown, so
     they are at the target point. All of them have
     swimmers aboard. If the recovery aircraft do not
     hear from the spacecraft; they will go ahead and
     put swimmers in the water, and if you are in good
     shape and give them a call, then they will hold
     off on dropping swimmers until sunrise.

[05:21:43:45]
_page : 2
CDR: Roger. Say again the sunrise and first light
     time for me, would you, please?

[05:21:43:53]
CC: I say again, 8.

[05:21:44:23]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Notice the rather large
     middle gimbal angle. Over.

[05:21:44:32]
CDR: Thank you.

[05:21:44:38]
CDR: Would you say again the daylight time, please,
     sunrise, and first light.

[05:21:44:44]
CC: Okay. Sunrise is 17:10 Zulu, and first light
     is 16:49 Zulu.

[05:21:45:01]
CDR: Thank you.

[05:21:46:05]
CC: Okay. Looking over the weather I gave you was -
     the 2000 foot scattered at the target point may
     have a 6000 foot broken layer above that. At the
     MAX lift point, you will have about the same thing,
     and altimeter is the same down the range. As you
     go further to the east, the weather should improve
     slightly; there is no problem with thunderstorms
     or rain showers in any of your recovery area.

[05:21:46:42]
CDR: Very good; thank you.

[05:21:46:51]
CC: The items that we still need will be a PRD reading
     as late as you can do it conveniently prior to
     a final stowage. And we don't have any numbers
     on the last crew sleep period. I'd like to
     verify that the secondary RCS was activated on
     all four quads. And I have about five comments
     on the entry checklist procedures to verify.

[05:21:47:24]
_page : 3
CDR: It was activated on all four quads; that's correct.
     Our final stowage is completed. We'll read out
     the PRD's for you now.

[05:21:47:35]
CC: Alright. Thank you.

[05:21:47:40]
CDR: The LMP's reads 0.64; I believe it's been that
     way throughout the flight. The CMP's reads 0.11,
     that's 1.11.

[05:21:47:58]
CC: Roger.

[05:21:48:02]
CDR: Stand by a minute. Let me look at it closely.
     That's 0.11.

[05:21:48:09]
CC: Roger. 0.11.

[05:21:48:11]
CDR: And the one I ended up with reads 3.10.

[05:21:48:18]
CC: Okay. Thank you.

[05:21:48:37]
CDR: Okay. Go ahead, Ken. What else do you want to
     talk about?

[05:21:48:41]
CC: Okay. To make everybody happy, we can use an
     estimate of the number of hours sleep the people
     got.

[05:21:48:52]
CDR: Just a minute, I'll give you that; I forgot. Bill
     Anders got about 5 hours, and Jim Lovell got about
     five, and I got about five and a half or six.

[05:21:49:09]
CC: Sounds good. Okay. We went through an exercise
     with the mockup on the preentry preparations, and
     we noticed that in the LMP's checklist on page S-12,
     when you go to top off the repress bottles, I believe
     it is a misprint; it should read the PLSS fill valve
     rather than the REPRESS valve, and we should be
     going to the FILL position as opposed to going to ON.

[05:21:49:47]
_page : 4
CDR: Roger. That's what we do.

[05:21:49:51]
CC: Okay. And on - go ahead.

[05:21:50:01]
CDR: Go ahead. We agree that's what we do.

[05:21:50:04]
CC: Okay. On page E-7 of the entry checklist and under
     step 34, as long as you have panel 382 open, that's
     a convenient time to go ahead and have the 
     evaporator water controls, both primary and secondary, to
     AUTO, and the suit heat exchanger for the secondary
     glycol to FLOW.

[05:21:50:27]
CDR: Those items are already accomplished.

[05:21:50:29]
CC: Very good. On page E-9, when you are getting
     ready to transfer the RCS to the command module
     position, if you want to avoid having the engines
     fire as a result of attitude correction, you might
     want to take the manual attitude switches to
     ACCEL COMMAND or MINIMAL IMPULSE. And again on
     E-9 Alfa at step 41 Bravo, if you want to go back
     to attitude hold, bring your manual attitude
     switches back to RATE.

[05:21:51:13]
CDR: What was that last step?

[05:21:51:15]
CC: Step 41 Bravo on page-E-9 Alfa. It's if you decide
     to use either MINIMAL IMPULSE or ACCEL COMMAND of
     page E-9, step 41 Bravo would be a good place
     to go back to RATE COMMAND.

[05:21:51:31]
_page : 5
CDR: Okay. We do a purge or - -

[05:21:51:35]
CC: Okay, fine. And - -

[05:21:51:39]
CDR: I didn't put all those control configurations
     changes on the checklist, but that's exactly
     what we did, used MINIMUM IMPULSE.

[05:21:51:47]

     to drogues, please.

[05:22:01:28]

[05:22:01:31]
CDR: And also, Ken, we are going to turn on our VHF
     now, about 4 hours before entry.

[05:22:01:37]

     we pick it up.

[05:22:01:41]

[05:22:17:35]
CDR: Go ahead, Houston.

[05:22:17:37]
CC: Okay. We have checked into your drogue time,
     and the number of 08:16 on your entry PAD is
     correct. We'll be giving you an updated entry
     PAD on the scheduled time of 143:30. At the same
     time, we'll be giving you an update of your state
     vectors for the LM and CSM. The midcourse 
     correction number 7 was less than seven-tenths foot per
     second, and we will not execute it. You have a
     P52 scheduled at 143:30 which is not required.
     It's your option. However, if you decide to delete
     the P52, the CMC self-check and DSKY condition
     light test are still requirements. Over.
     . 

[05:22:18:32]
_page : 6

     We weren't planning to do the CMC self-test.

[05:22:20:53]
CDR: On that DSKY check . ..

[05:22:21:07]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. That's my mistake on CMC
     self-check and DSKY condition light. That's an
     optional test. Over.

[05:22:21:16]
CDR: That's what we thought, Ken. Gosh, if that's
     been working perfectly for 6 days, I don't see
     any reason to test it.

[05:22:21:24]

[05:22:51:45]
CC: Apollo 8, go ahead.

[05:22:51:49]
LMP: I am just - It is my understanding that we are to
     bring up the secondary loop at 1 hour prior to SEP,
     isn't that right?

[05:22:51:54]
CC: That is affirmative, about page Echo 9.

[05:22:52:10]
LMP: Okay.

[05:22:52:16]
CC: And Bill, ... suggested if we have the water
     boiler going on the primary loop, that you - you
     might wait about 5 minutes or so before you initiate
     the secondary loop.

[05:22:52:38]
LMP: Wait 5 minutes from what? From the time the primary
     loop starts or from 1 hour?

[05:22:52:43]
CC: From the time the primary loop starts; this will
     give you a check to see if it had a chance to dry
     out or not.

[05:22:53:04]
LMP: Oh, I am with you. Okay.

[05:22:53:09]
CC: And for your information, we already have a VHF
     downlink. It's poor quality, but we do have
     contact.

[05:22:53:22]
LMP: Okay. We haven't turned anything over to VHF yet.

[05:22:53:25]
CC: Okay.

[05:22:53:27]
LMP: We tried to call you on the VHF though, Ken.

[05:22:53:30]

     may not be able to understand you.

[05:22:57:14]
CC: Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.

[05:22:57:17]
LMP: Ken, we got two things going here which make this
     suit heat exchanger flow a little different. One
     of them is we are not doing a coldsoak, and the
     other one is we are powering down the secondary
     loop prior to SEP. And I wonder if it is a good
     idea to have the suit heat exchanger only on a
     secondary loop in that case. And plus the fact 
     that we haven't got any cabin heat exchanger.

[05:22:57:45]
CC: I don't think that was the intent, Bill. What
     they had in mind, we have the suit heat exchanger
     on both loops; and if they got too cold, you could
     use the panel switching to shut down the primary .
     loop through the heat exchanger. But in any event,
     you would always have something going to the suit
     heat exchanger. I recognize that we are going to
     be shutting down the secondary heat exchanger
     pre-SEP and then turning it back on prior to entry,
     but the idea was to have both primary and secondary
     loops on the suit heat exchanger simultaneously.

[05:22:58:24]
LMP: Yes, my checklist doesn't reflect that. I think
     that's a good idea because we are a little suspect
     of our cabin fans and don't plan to use them.

     main bus voltage?

[05:23:12:41]

LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. Over.

[05:23:16:19]
CC: Apollo 8, go ahead.

[05:23:16:24]
LMP: I am still a little bit confused on that- on this
     activating the secondary loop. You indicated
     inactivating it at 1 hour or 5 minutes after the
     primary evaporator comes on the line. My checklist
     shows that the primary evaporator probably won't
     come on the line until we bypass the radiators.
     Have you got something else in mind I don't
     know about?

[05:23:16:56]
CC: Okay, Bill. We passed up an update some time back
     on page E-9 step 38 right at the beginning, and
     you have got a final GET drift check. And between
     there and the step 39 where it says terminate CM
     RCS preheat, that was the place we wanted to activate
     the primary loop by putting the glycol evaporator
     water switch to AUTO and the glycol evaporator
     steam pressure to AUTO.

[05:23:17:41]
_page : 4
LMP: Roger. I don't expect it to boil, though. Do you?

[05:23:17:45]
CC: Okay, Bill. We are hoping that it will there. It
     looks like we will have had a stable attitude for
     sometime, and we anticipate that it will be warm
     enough to make it boil. That is the reason it's
     suggested if it is boiling, that you wait. If it
     isn't, go ahead and turn on the secondary loop.

LMP: Go ahead, Houston.

[05:23:20:11]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. We would like to update your LM
     state vector, CSM state vector, and target point.
     If it is convenient now, why, we will go ahead
     and do that if you will go to P00 and ACCEPT.

[05:23:20:27]
LMP: Roger. P00 and ACCEPT.

[05:23:29:20]

     computer is yours.

[05:23:29:29]
LMP: Okay.

[05:23:29:30]
CC: You can take it back to BLOCK, and for Bill's
     information, latest guess from the main bus post-SEP
     voltage to 27.5

[05:23:59:58]
CC: Okay, Apollo 8. Can you tell us if you've done
     anything with your potable water? We've noticed
     our readout has gone from 100 percent down to 56
     in the last couple of minutes.

[06:00:00:17]
CMP: We're reading about 50 percent right now.

[06:00:00:22]
CC: Roger. That correlates with what we see. Have
     you done anything to change configuration? Over.

[06:00:00:44]
CMP: Yes, we noticed the venting here, too, Houston.

[06:00:01:10]
CC: Jim, did you mean you could visually see it?

[06:00:01:14]
CMP: Yes, we're - oh, stand by, Ken. Bill just dumped
     urine, so that might have been urine we were seeing.

[06:00:01:45]
CMP: Bill just shut the potable inlet, Ken.

[06:00:01:48]

_page : 7
CMP: Roger, Houston. We're still showing about 52
     percent, and we had our switch on waste so we don't
     know whether it dropped from a higher value or not.
     Has yours been stabilized now?

[06:00:05:15]
CC: That's affirmative; ours has stabilized now. It
     was reading full just a few minutes ago.

[06:00:05:25]
CMP: Roger. I don't think - we can't account for any
     sudden drop in water.

[06:00:05:31]
CC: Okay. We looked in the malfunction procedures, and
     number 28 doesn't reveal anything very startling.

[06:00:05:42]
CMP: Bill is looking there now.

[06:00:08:53]
LMP: Houston, Apollo 8. Over.

[06:00:08:57]
CC: Go ahead, 8.

[06:00:09:00]
LMP: Okay. I'm looking at malfunction 28, and it takes
     you to box 6, but I don't really think that's the
     problem because the waste tank quantity hasn't
     changed any. Over.

[06:00:09:11]
CC: Okay. I concur. We're watching the same thing.

[06:00:09:15]
LMP: Look, we don't care about the potable tank, but
     we do about the waste tank, so just in case there
     is a problem somewhere, I'm going to shut the potable
     tank off and leave the waste tank inlet valve open.
     How does that sound to you?

[06:00:09:29]
CC: Stand by. Okay, 8. We concur.
