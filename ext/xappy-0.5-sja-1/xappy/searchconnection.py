    """A result from a search.

    As well as being a ProcessedDocument representing the document in the
    database, the result has several members which may be used to get
    information about how well the document matches the search:

     - `rank`: The rank of the document in the search results, starting at 0
       (ie, 0 is the "top" result, 1 is the second result, etc).

     - `weight`: A floating point number indicating the weight of the result
       document.  The value is only meaningful relative to other results for a
       given search - a different search, or the same search with a different
       database, may give an entirely different scale to the weights.  This
       should not usually be displayed to users, but may be useful if trying to
       perform advanced reweighting operations on search results.

     - `percent`: A percentage value for the weight of a document.  This is
       just a rescaled form of the `weight` member.  It doesn't represent any
       kind of probability value; the only real meaning of the numbers is that,
       within a single set of results, a document with a higher percentage
       corresponds to a better match.  Because the percentage doesn't really
       represent a probability, or a confidence value, it is probably unhelpful
       to display it to most users, since they tend to place an over emphasis
       on its meaning.  However, it is included because it may be useful

        This is intended for parsing queries entered by a user.  If you wish to
        combine structured queries, it is generally better to use the other
        query building methods, such as `query_composite` (though you may wish
        to create parts of the query to combine with such methods with this
        method).

        The string passed to this method can have various operators in it.  In
        particular, it may contain field specifiers (ie, field names, followed
        by a colon, followed by some text to search for in that field).  For
        example, if "author" is a field in the database, the search string
        could contain "author:richard", and this would be interpreted as
        "search for richard in the author field".  By default, any fields in
        the database which are indexed with INDEX_EXACT or INDEX_FREETEXT will
        be available for field specific searching in this way - however, this
        can be modified using the "allow" or "deny" parameters, and also by the
        allow_field_specific tag on INDEX_FREETEXT fields.

        Any text which isn't prefixed by a field specifier is used to search
        the "default set" of fields.  By default, this is the full set of
        fields in the database which are indexed with INDEX_FREETEXT and for
        which the search_by_default flag set (ie, if the text is found in any
        of those fields, the query will match).  However, this may be modified
        with the "default_allow" and "default_deny" parameters.  (Note that
        fields which are indexed with INDEX_EXACT aren't allowed to be used in
        the default list of fields.)

        - `string`: The string to parse.
        - `allow`: A list of fields to allow in the query.
        - `deny`: A list of fields not to allow in the query.
        - `default_op`: The default operator to combine query terms with.
        - `default_allow`: A list of fields to search for by default.
        - `default_deny`: A list of fields not to search for by default.

        Only one of `allow` and `deny` may be specified.

        Only one of `default_allow` and `default_deny` may be specified.

        If any of the entries in `allow` are not present in the configuration
        for the database, or are not specified for indexing (either as
        INDEX_EXACT or INDEX_FREETEXT), they will be ignored.  If any of the
        entries in `deny` are not present in the configuration for the

          ranks start at 0, which represents the "best" matching document.

          to return.  This is exclusive, so the result with this rank will not
          be returned.
        - `checkatleast` is the minimum number of results to check for: the
          estimate of the total number of matches will always be exact if
          the number of matches is less than `checkatleast`.  A value of ``-1``

        - `gettags` is the name of a field to count tag occurrences in, or a
          list of fields to do so.
        - `getfacets` is a boolean - if True, the matching documents will be
          examined to build up a list of the facet values contained in them.
        - `allowfacets` is a list of the fieldnames of facets to consider.
        - `denyfacets` is a list of fieldnames of facets which will not be
          considered.

          subfacets of facets appearing in the query are considered (taking
          precedence over `allowfacets` and `denyfacets`).
        - `percentcutoff` is the minimum percentage a result must have to be
          returned.
        - `weightcutoff` is the minimum weight a result must have to be
          returned.
        - `query_type` is a value indicating the type of query being
          performed. If not None, the value is used to influence which facets
