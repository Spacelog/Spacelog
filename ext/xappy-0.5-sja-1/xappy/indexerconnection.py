        other changes to the indexing.

        Note: this is an approximate measure - the actual amount of memory used
        max exceed the specified amount.  Also, note that future versions of
        xapian are likely to implement this differently, so this setting may be

        Setting too low a value will result in excessive flushing, and very
        slow indexing.  Setting too high a value will result in excessive
        buffering, leading to swapping, and very slow indexing.

        A reasonable default for max_mem_proportion for a system which is
